item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview we are a global energy and gasification technology company that provides products and solutions to the energy and chemical industries 
our strategy is to create value by providing technology and equipment in regions where low rank coals and biomass feedstocks can be profitably converted into high value products through our proprietary fluidized bed gasification technology  which technology is based on the u gas process developed by the gas technology institute  but is augmented and differentiated by our own intellectual property gained by owning and operating one commercial plant and partnering in a second that is currently in commissioning 
we do this through providing a proprietary technology package whereby we license technology rights to third parties  deliver an engineered technology package and provide proprietary equipment components to customers who have contracted to own and operate projects 
in addition  we may i integrate our technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering where we may invest in projects either directly or through an investment partner  ii partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our technology package into an integrated modular product offering  iii provide technology to enable coal resources to be integrated together with our technology where the coal resources may be of little value without our conversion technology  or iv acquire or partner with owners of these coal resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the coal resources 
we believe that we have several advantages over commercially available competing gasification technologies  such as entrained flow  fixed and moving bed gasification technologies  including our ability to use all ranks of coals including low rank  high ash and high moisture coals  which are significantly cheaper than higher grade coals  many coal waste products and biomass feed stocks 
in addition  our technology s advanced fluidized bed design is tolerant to changes in feedstock 
these factors enable us to be a lower cost producer of synthesis gas  or syngas  a mixture of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide  which can then be used to produce other products 
depending on local market need and fuel sources  syngas can be used as a fuel gas in industrial applications or can be used to produce many products including power  synthetic natural gas  or sng  methanol  dimethyl ether  or dme  glycol  ammonia  direct reduction iron  or dri  gasoline and other transportation fuels  steam  and other byproducts eg  sulphur  carbon dioxide or ash 
our principal operating activities are currently in china 
however  we are developing opportunities in other countries including india  the us and australia  as well as other parts of asia  southern africa and europe 
our zz joint venture project is our first commercial scale coal gasification plant and is located in shandong province  china 
it started up in february and was in commercial operation from december until late september when it was shut down as described below under business current operations and projects zao zhuang joint venture 
our yima project in henan province  china is currently in its final stages of construction and plant commissioning 
results of operations we are in our development stage and therefore have had limited operations 
we have sustained net losses of million from november   the date of our inception  to june  year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue 
total revenue decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  product sales decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were derived from the sale of syngas and byproducts produced at the zz joint venture plant to hai hua 
the decrease in product sales was due primarily to no capacity fee revenue being received during the year ended june  and the suspension of syngas production at the zz joint venture plant in late september 
table of contents in may  hai hua notified the zz joint venture plant that it will not continue payment of capacity fees beyond april the unpaid amount totaled million cumulatively as of june  the plant continued to operate and provide syngas to hai hua until operations were suspended in late september  and hai hua has paid other contractual obligations such as the energy fees and by product sales due under the contract 
we are continuing to work with hai hua on alternatives to resolve this issue and recover these fees including restructuring the current business arrangement to create an integrated syngas to methanol operation 
we did not recognize these capacity fee revenues during fiscal and we will not recognize any capacity fees until collection is reasonably assured 
technology licensing and related services revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were generated from the testing of coal at the zz joint venture plant  and other coal testing  feasibility studies and other technical services provided in association with our technology licensing business 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to the suspension of syngas production at the zz joint venture plant in late september general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to non recurring consulting related costs of million  including a million charge to recognize the loss related to a matter with a consulting firm which was settled in may and fees associated with collecting a payment from hai hua  offset  in part  by a reduction in expenses of million due principally to decreased compensation and other expenses 
recurring general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  professional and consulting fees  travel  and other costs of our corporate  development and administrative functions in houston and shanghai  and project and technical development expenses 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and related to the expensing of the estimated fair values of awarded stock options and restricted stock 
the decrease was principally due to awarding fewer stock based awards in compared to depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and was primarily related to depreciation of our zz joint venture plant s assets and our corporate assets 
equity in losses of joint ventures

the losses of the yima joint ventures related to non capitalizable costs incurred during the design  construction and start up phases 
the losses of srs related to development costs including the value of midas contributed services  consulting and travel expenses 
foreign currency gain 
foreign currency gains decreased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the foreign currency gains have resulted from the appreciation of the renminbi yuan relative to the us dollar and are generated on us dollar denominated shareholder loans payable by our chinese operations 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to lower cash equivalent investments 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  our interest expense relates primarily to the zz joint venture s outstanding principal balance on its loan with icbc 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  and resulted from increased losses from the zz joint venture 

table of contents year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue 
total revenue increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  product sales increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were derived from the sale of syngas and byproducts produced at the zz joint venture plant to hai hua 
the increase in revenue was due to higher levels of syngas production during fiscal as compared to fiscal for the years ended june  and  the plant operated for and of the period  respectively  and the plant s availability for production was and of the period  respectively 
during the three months ended june   hai hua notified the zz joint venture plant that it will not continue payment of capacity fees beyond april for commercial and contractual reasons 
the unpaid amount totaled approximately  as of june  the plant has continued to operate and provide syngas to hai hua  and hai hua has paid other contractual obligations such as the energy fees and by product sales due under the contract 
we did not recognize these capacity fee revenues during fiscal and we will not recognize any capacity fees until collection is reasonably assured 
technology licensing and related services revenues increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to revenues generated from the recognition of previously deferred revenues received under a license agreement entered into in april which has since been terminated due to the licensee s inability to obtain financing for its project 
related services revenue for both years included testing of coal at the zz joint venture plant  and other coal testing  feasibility studies and other technical services provided in association with our technology licensing business 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were comprised principally of coal consumption and electricity cost at the zz joint venture plant 
the increase was due primarily to the increase in syngas production during the year ended june  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  project and technical development expenses decreased by due to reducing costs we incurred with third parties for development of our technology 
expenses for the year ended june  included a million charge for a consulting fee related to the financial closing of the yima project and other technical support and development costs of biomass gasification projects in the us other general and administrative expenses increases included travel and professional fees related to licensing  other business development activities  and increased annual royalty expense owed to gti beginning in january these cost increases were offset  in part  by a reduction in corporate personnel expenses 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was principally due to forfeitures of certain stock option awards and due to the fair values of recent stock option awards being lower than the fair values of certain prior awards as a result of the decrease in the price of our common stock 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and was primarily related to depreciation of our zz joint venture plant s assets 
asset impairment loss 
the asset impairment loss of million during the year ended june  was related to the write off of the long lived assets of the gc joint venture 
we had no asset impairment loss during the year ended june  equity in losses of joint ventures 
the equity in losses of joint ventures increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  and relates to our share of the losses incurred by the yima joint ventures during the construction phase 
the losses were comprised of non capitalizable costs incurred during the design and construction phase  offset in part  by interest income earned on invested funds contributed by us and yima 
the losses for the year ended june  increased due to higher personnel and land lease related costs as portions of the project are nearing completion 

table of contents foreign currency gain 
foreign currency gains increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the foreign currency gains have resulted from the appreciation of the renminbi yuan relative to the us dollar and are generated on us dollar denominated shareholder loans payable by our chinese operations 
interest income 
interest income increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to higher yields earned on cash equivalent investments 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for both of the years ended june  and our interest expense relates primarily to our long term debt comprised of the zz joint venture s outstanding principal balance on its loan with the industrial and commercial bank of china  or icbc 
in addition  the zz joint venture has incurred additional interest expense of approximately  during due to incurring discounting costs on bank notes received from its customer in settlement of the zz joint venture s accounts receivable 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended june  was principally from golden concord absorbing their interest in the asset impairment loss recognized by the gc joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources we are in our development stage and have financed our operations to date through private placements of our common stock in and and two public offerings  one in november and one in june we have used the proceeds of these offerings primarily for the development of and investments in our joint ventures in china  including our investments in the zz joint venture and the yima joint ventures  and to pay other development and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we have entered into a loan agreement with icbc to fund certain of the costs of the zz joint venture 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital available to us 
during the year ended june   we used million in operating activities compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease in cash used in operating activities was due principally to the million advance to the zz joint venture from hai hua 
during fiscal  we used million in investing activities primarily to fund the start up and development of srs 
during each of fiscal and  we used million in financing activities for the scheduled semi annual principal payments on the zz joint venture s loan with icbc 
other financing activities included the receipt of a million deposit from hongye towards the share purchase agreement with hongye during fiscal which is to be repaid to hongye in connection with the funding described below and the receipt of million from the issuance of common stock to zuari during fiscal on september   we received gross proceeds of approximately million from hongye and issued  shares to hongye 
hongye is expected to pay the remaining  of their aggregate purchase price for their shares  and receive their  share balance  at the closing of the zhongmo transaction 
the net proceeds received by us from these stock sales are to be fully applied to our operations and projects in china and are to be deposited into a bank account in china or hong kong controlled by our china centric business platform  ses china 
loan agreement on march   the zz joint venture entered into a seven year loan agreement and received million of loan proceeds pursuant to the terms of a fixed asset loan contract with icbc to complete the project financing for the zz joint venture 
key terms of the fixed asset loan contract with icbc are as follows term of the loan is seven years from the commencement date march  of the loan  interest is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china  and as of june   the applicable interest rate was and is payable monthly  principal payments of rmb million approximately million based on current currency exchange rates are due in march and september of each year through march  hai hua is the guarantor of the entire loan  
table of contents assets of the zz joint venture are pledged as collateral for the loan  covenants include  among other things  prohibiting pre payment without the consent of icbc and permitting icbc to be involved in the review and inspection of the zz joint venture plant  and subject to customary events of default which  should one or more of them occur and be continuing  would permit icbc to declare all amounts owing under the contract to be due and payable immediately 
as of june   the zz joint venture was in compliance with all covenants and obligations under the fixed asset loan contract 
share purchase agreements share purchase agreements with hongye and zhongmo on june   we entered into a share purchase agreement with hongye international investment group co  ltd  or hongye  pursuant to which hongye will acquire  shares of our common stock for per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  and entered into a share purchase agreement with shanghai zhongmo investment management co  ltd  or zhongmo  pursuant to which zhongmo will acquire  shares of the common stock for per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the net proceeds received by us are to be fully applied to our operations and projects in china and are to be deposited into a bank account in china or hong kong controlled by our china centric business platform  ses china 
the terms and conditions of the agreement are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
on september   we received gross proceeds of approximately million from hongye and issued  shares to hongye 
hongye is expected to pay the remaining  of their aggregate purchase price for their shares  and receive their  share balance  at the closing of the zhongmo transaction 
share purchase agreement with zjx on march   we entered into a share purchase agreement  or the agreement  with china energy industry holdings group co  ltd  or china energy  and zhongjixuan investment management company ltd  or zjx  pursuant to which we will issue on the closing date to china energy  shares of our common stock  in exchange for approximately million  or the consideration 
within business days after the accomplishment of the milestone  as defined  we shall further issue directly to china energy an amount of shares of common stock which  when combined with the shares issued on the closing date  equals of the outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
the terms and conditions of the agreement are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
closing of the transaction with china energy and zjx is subject to approval by our stockholders and other customary closing conditions 
although the agreement was not extended at march   we agreed with zjx to keep the agreement in effect as long as the parties are making good progress toward meeting the objective of completing the agreement in a reasonable amount of time 
use of proceeds subject to the discretion and approval of the board  the consideration  net of costs and expenses  is required to be applied to the following i incorporation of a company headquarters in china to consolidate the ownership of our investment projects in china and enhance our presence in china  ii investing in the expansion of our zz joint venture  iii investing in phase i of our yima joint ventures  iv acquiring an ownership interest in a coal mine that will provide coal to the yima joint venture project  v investing in our golden concord joint venture  vi other chinese projects that may be recommended to the board from time to time  and vii other expenses of the operation and business of us in china 
zjx will use reasonable endeavours to assist us to obtain third party funding third party direct equity investment in projects or debt financing to the projects to a cover funding needs of the above projects  b provide funding for us to invest in future phases of the yima joint venture project  c invest in strategic coal resources in china connected to our projects  and d provide funding for us to invest in other projects in china not listed above and assist us to obtain third party investment in any of our other projects 

table of contents project development zjx is required to use reasonable endeavours to create at least four project joint ventures  or the mjvs  in the areas of synthetic natural gas  methanol to gasoline  fertilizer  and electric power 
funding for each mjv is expected to be approximately rmb billion approximately billion based on the exchange rate as of december  
each mjv is expected to be funded with equity from a strategic investor plus project debt 
we are anticipated to be part owner of each mjv through a targeted carry provided by the strategic investor as part of our development of and provision of technology for the particular projects 
zjx will help us work with the strategic investors to obtain long term purchase commitments for each of the mjvs prior to the start of construction of each such project 
other we have included the million payment paid to gti in june toward future royalties due to gti for the yima joint ventures project as part of our investment in the yima project 
an additional future royalty payment of approximately million will be due to gti upon the commissioning of the gasifier equipment for the yima project which is expected during fiscal outlook our strategy is to create value by providing technology and equipment in regions where low rank coals and biomass feedstocks can be profitably converted into high value products through our proprietary fluidized bed gasification technology  which is technology is based on the u gas process developed by gti  but is augmented and differentiated by our own intellectual property gained by owning and operating one commercial plant and partnering in a second that is currently in commissioning 
we do this by providing a proprietary technology package whereby we license our technology rights to third parties  deliver an engineered technology package and provide proprietary equipment components to customers who have contracted to own and operate projects 
we anticipate that we can generate revenues through engineering and technical service fees  as well as licensing fees and royalties on products sold by our licensees that incorporate our proprietary technology without incurring the significant capital costs required to develop a plant 
we also believe that our licensing activities will help advance our project development activities  which may allow us to make selective equity investments in such projects in the future and afford opportunities to develop integrated  modular product offerings 
additionally  we are continuing to improve our technology in ways we believe will enhance our ability to further develop our licensing activities 
we currently plan to use our available cash for i general and administrative expenses  including the ses china business platform  ii debt service related to the zz joint venture  iii working capital  iv project  third party licensing and technical development expenses  v operating expenses of srs  and vi general corporate purposes 
the actual allocation and timing of these expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including changes in our strategic relationships  commodity prices and industry conditions  and other factors that we cannot currently predict 
in particular  any future decrease in economic activity in china or in other regions of the world in which we may in the future do business could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
although demand for methanol is increasing is some regions  markets for commodities such as methanol have been under significant pressure and we are unsure of how much longer methanol prices may remain depressed 
accordingly  our ability to finance and develop our existing projects  commence any new projects and sell products from our current operations could be adversely impacted 
we are pursuing possible technology licensing opportunities with third parties allowing us to build on our experience at the zz joint venture and our overall technological and engineering capabilities 
we are placing increased focus on development of licensing opportunities for our proprietary gasification technology on a global basis with a focus on india  china  eastern europe  the us  australia and vietnam  as well as other parts of asia and southern africa  due to their large low rank coal resources 
our prospects are growing globally in numbers and quality 
in particular  in india  we believe the market for coal gasification plants is now developing due to large infrastructure growth demands and an increasing need for a variety of basic chemical and energy products 
notably  we are in advanced discussions with an large indian industrial company and we are hopeful that we will soon close on our first licensing transaction 
we have also been evaluated in two separate and thorough technology comparisons for prospective indian customers where our technology was evaluated for their projects which would operate on high ash indian coal 
having access to resources in these regions may lead to new commercial opportunities and greater cost and operating efficiencies in existing or planned projects 
we may i integrate our technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering where we may invest in projects either directly or through an investment partner  ii partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our technology package into an integrated modular product offering  iii provide technology to enable coal resources to be integrated together with our technology where the coal resources may be of little commercial value without our conversion technology  or iv acquire or partner with owners of these coal resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the coal resource 
we understand the need to partner in certain markets  and plan to do so with companies that we believe can help us accelerate our business 
our partnering approach in some cases is country specific and in some cases is industry or segment specific 
additionally  where strategic relationships and capital and or financing is available  we may acquire an interest in such resources  including existing facilities or coal mines  where we could create value with our gasification technology by securing direct access to feedstock 
we are also actively pursuing business verticals in the segments of transportation fuels  steel and fertilizers where our technology is specifically well suited and developing new downstream coal to chemicals and coal to energy projects which may expand our initial focus to include facilities producing sng  mtg  glycol  and power and reducing gas for the steel industry 

table of contents we have recently developed a new  china centric business platform ses china which is intended to be a stand alone  self funding business platform that will encompass all current and future ses business activities and initiatives in china  including our yima joint venture 
we have also engaged crystal vision energy limited to provide management support functions to ses china 
colin s 
tam  executive chairman of crystal vision  will assume leadership of ses china as managing director 
we believe the formation of ses china will enable us to attract financially strong and highly skilled chinese partners whuch desire to invest into the growth of china s clean energy space and who recognize the opportunity afforded by our technology capability and business model  such as our ammonia retro fit business opportunity with beijing zhonghuan engineering project management co  ltd 
zep 
together with zep  we see an immediate business opportunity to replace the approximately  inefficient gasifiers that require expensive coal with our clean  lower cost gasifiers  which use low cost coal 
our gasifier will typically replace five of these old generation gasifiers which yields a total available market of about gasifiers in china 
other business verticals that we can address through ses china include clean coal to chemicals projects  clean renewable fuels and power businesses  direct reduced iron for the steel industry  and for longer term value creation  larger scale sng projects utilizing our low rank coal resources and biomass 
we are also actively pursuing new project partners to invest in our ongoing development efforts and may possibly be expanding both the size and scope of our zz joint venture plant 
our yima joint venture plant is now in the commissioning and early start up stage with expected methanol production and first sales by the end of this year 
on september   we received gross proceeds of approximately million from hongye and issued  shares to hongye 
hongye is expected to pay the remaining  of their aggregate purchase price for their shares  and receive their  share balance  at the closing of the zhongmo transaction 
the net proceeds received by us from these stock sales are to be fully applied to our operations and projects in china and are to be deposited into a bank account in china or hong kong controlled by our china centric business platform  ses china 
discussions with zjx and china energy are active and ongoing 
zjx is currently working through their agreements with potential partners that would bring the necessary funds to china energy to complete the transaction with ses 
we believe that the zz joint venture plant has achieved significant success demonstrating u gas technology as well as our technical and operating capabilities 
we are of the view that by improving financial performance and reducing operating costs at the zz joint venture plant our overall financial performance can be improved 
to date  hai hua has been unable to offtake the volume of syngas originally expected for the original plant design and as a result the plant has incurred operating losses 
we do not foresee this situation changing significantly in the near term 
because of this  the zz joint venture is working on various arrangements to increase the syngas offtake volume 
such arrangements involve a combination of technical improvement to hai hua s methanol unit  as well as restructuring the current business arrangement to create an integrated syngas to methanol operation 
in december  we entered into a framework agreement with hai hua pursuant to which we and hai hua are working to complete a definitive agreement that will provide the basis for a fully integrated syngas to methanol operation 
we have yet to complete this definitive agreement with hai hua primarily due to a controlling interest of hai hua being recently acquired by weijiao 
weijiao brought in new management team which is working collaboratively with ses to discuss the methanol integration project and to resolve the commercial issues 
as currently planned  the methanol integration project will require approximately million of additional capital 
if the definitive agreement is signed and the additional capital is received  the commercial work and physical integration work will begin 
this work is expected to take about six months to complete and we will continue to keep the plant idle until this commercial work is completed 
we are also evaluating alternative products and partnership structures for a possible expansion of the zz joint venture plant 
the scope of the expansion is still under evaluation 
we are in discussions with several potential partners on this expansion 
despite our work with hai hua on improving financial performance and reducing costs  hai hua has not made the capacity fee payments to the zz joint venture since april as described under results of operation 
the unpaid amount totals approximately million as of june  although we are continuing to work with hai hua on alternatives to resolve the issue  there can be no assurances that we will collect these amounts 
in late september  both the hai hua methanol plant and the zz joint venture plant were shut down for scheduled maintenance and  as noted above  the zz joint venture plant has been kept idle while we develop a revised commercial arrangement with hai hua 
in march  hai hua advanced approximately million towards future costs of the revised commercial arrangement 

table of contents we believe that there is currently a shift in the coal gasification business toward the use of low quality  and therefore low cost  coals for coal to energy and chemicals projects and we believe that china is a good example of this new direction in coal gasification 
according to the international energy outlook from the us energy information administration  china s natural gas consumption is estimated to reach trillion cubic feet in but domestic production of natural gas in china is estimated to be trillion cubic feet in today  coal to sng projects are beginning to progress and the chinese government supports these types of coal to energy projects 
due to this estimated shortfall in natural gas  combined with the current encouragement from the chinese government for these projects  we believe there is potential in china for several of these sng projects which are anticipated to be very large scale as compared to previous coal to chemical projects that have been built in china 
in addition  we believe many of these projects will be located in regions such as inner mongolia where very low cost lignite coals can be made available and are necessary to reduce the production cost of sng 
our technology is well suited for this location due to its ability to process these low quality coals and to meet local requirements for clean production of syngas  without tars and oils produced by other technologies  and very low water usage for the overall process 
in addition  inner mongolia government regulations permit higher quality coals to be made available to those companies that can cleanly gasify the low quality lignite coals 
this creates the potential to sell the high quality coals directly to the market while operating the project on low cost lignite  further enhancing the overall financial performance and value created by the project 
in addition  we have been continuing to work with midas in identifying other sources of low quality coals around the world  primarily in asia  to develop additional projects for srs utilizing our technology 
our primary focus for srs is to acquire ownership positions in low quality coal resources that can then be used as fuel feedstock for high value products such as sng  in projects using our technology  and to facilitate the development of these projects with industry partners in regions where gas prices are based on expensive lng 
for example  as noted above  srs entered into an agreement with ncondezi coal company limited for a three month study to determine the feasibility of mining and exporting to the asia pacific region up to million tons per year of low volatile coal  in addition to ncondezi s export thermal grade coal resources  from mozambique 
in all of these types of projects  we believe that we have the opportunity to create more value from the u gas technology than licensing alone could bring us 
srs is also actively engaged in commercial discussions related to securing investment partners for the next tranche of funding necessary for project development 
this funding is planned to be used to independently advance the coal resource and integrated project development without further start up cost to us 
we expect to continue for a period of time to have negative operating cash flows until we can generate sufficient cash flows from ses china including the zz joint venture and the yima joint ventures or our licensing and related service projects  as well as from other projects which are under development  to cover our general and administrative expenses and other operating costs 
in addition  if we are not able to complete the zjx china energy transaction  we will need to aggressively pursue additional partners in china and may need to seek other equity financing or reduce our operating expenses 
we will also limit the development of any further projects until we have assurances that acceptable financing is available to complete the project 
despite this  we will continue to pursue the development of selective projects with strong and credible partners or off takers where we believe equity and debt can be raised or where we believe we can attract a financial partner to participate in the project 
we can make no assurances that our business operations will develop and provide us with sufficient cash flows to continue our operations 
we may need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing for any new projects that are developed  to support our existing projects and possible expansions  and to meet corporate general and administrative expenses 
we cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things  i maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels  ii successfully develop our licensing and related service businesses  iii negotiate and enter into new gasification plant development contracts and licensing agreements  iv expand our operations  v hire and train new employees  or vi respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions which are inherently imprecise and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies due to the significance  subjectivity and judgment involved in determining our estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis utilizing historic experience  anticipated future events or trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the resulting effects of changes in our estimates are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the change in estimate become known 

table of contents we believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sales of products  which includes the capacity fee and energy fee earned at the zz joint venture plant  and byproducts are recognized when the following elements are satisfied i there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  ii there is persuasive evidence that an agreement exists  iii delivery has occurred  iv the sales price is fixed or determinable  and v collectability is reasonably assured 
technology licensing revenue is typically received over the course of a project s development as milestones are met 
we may receive upfront licensing fee payments when a license agreement is entered into 
typically  the majority of a license fee is due once project financing and equipment installation occur 
we recognize license fees as revenue when the license fees become due and payable under the license agreement  subject to the deferral of the amount of the performance guarantee 
fees earned for engineering services  such as services that relate to integrating our technology to a customer s project  are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
impairment evaluation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  construction in progress  equity method investments and specifically identified intangibles  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used 
we evaluate our operating plants as a whole 
production equipment at each plant is not evaluated for impairment separately  as it is integral to the assumed future operations of the plant 
all construction and development projects are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of potential reduction in fair value 
if it is determined that it is no longer probable that the projects will be completed and all capitalized costs recovered through future operations  the carrying values of the projects would be written down to the recoverable value 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment charge 
the following summarizes some of the most significant estimates and assumptions used in evaluating if we have an impairment charge 
undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our other earnings forecasts 
the use of this method involves inherent uncertainty 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
fair value 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
we will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment 
we may also consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations  however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments for equity method investments such as our equity investment in the yima joint ventures involve the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that we own directly 
similarly  our estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subjective  and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material 

table of contents zz joint venture plant impairment analysis due to the economic trends that have significantly affected commodity prices including methanol  hai hua s refusal to pay capacity fees owed to the zz joint venture and the zz joint venture plant s operating losses to date  we believed an impairment assessment of the zz joint venture plant was warranted as of june  we performed an analysis of the zz joint venture plant and determined that these assets were not impaired based upon management s estimated cash flow projections for the plant 
such estimated cash flow projections included a case based on the completion of the ongoing negotiations between us and hai hua to restructure the current business arrangement to create an integrated syngas to methanol operation 
this restructuring would include a combination of technical improvements being made to hai hua s methanol unit allowing for increased syngas off take and other repairs and improvements being made to the plant enabling more efficient joint production of methanol 
an alternative case was based on developing an additional downstream facility to produce glycol 
this case assumes the additional capital investment is made by a strategic partner and that we retain a minority interest in the combined project 
if we are not successful in restructuring the joint venture or otherwise improving the zz joint venture s profitability  or if management s estimated cash flow projections for these assets decrease  the zz joint venture plant could become impaired 
accounting for variable interest entities and financial statement consolidation criteria the joint ventures which we enter into may be considered variable interest entities  or vies 
we consolidate all vies where we are the primary beneficiary 
this determination is made at the inception of our involvement with the vie 
we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors and form a conclusion that we  or another interest holder  absorb a majority of the entity s risk for expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s potential for expected residual returns  or both 
we do not consolidate vies where we are not the primary beneficiary 
we account for these unconsolidated vies under the equity method of accounting and include our net investment in investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
our equity interest in the net income or loss from our unconsolidated vies is recorded in non operating income expense on a net basis on our consolidated statement of operations 
we have determined that the zz joint venture is a vie and that we are the primary beneficiary 
in addition  we considered whether the terms of the syngas purchase and sale agreement with hai hua contained a lease 
the factors considered included i our ability to operate and control the plant during the initial years  and ii whether it was more than remote that one or more parties other than hai hua would purchase more than a minor amount considered to be of the plant s output during the term of the syngas purchase and sale agreement 
because we determined that the syngas purchase and sale agreement did not contain a lease  we account for the revenues from this agreement in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for product sales 
we have determined that the yima joint ventures are vies and that yima is the primary beneficiary since yima has a ownership interest in the yima joint ventures 
we have determined that the gc joint venture is a vie and that we are the primary beneficiary since we have a ownership interest in the gc joint venture and since there are no qualitative factors that would preclude us from being deemed the primary beneficiary 
we have determined that srs is a vie and that we are not the primary beneficiary since we and midas each have a ownership interest in srs and the control  risks and benefits of srs are shared equally 
off balance sheet arrangements in january  we entered into a month lease agreement  with a month optional renewal  for our corporate offices in houston  texas 
the lease commenced on march  with rental payments of  per month for the first year and escalating thereafter annually 

table of contents contractual obligations our material contractual obligations at june  were as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years zz joint venture long term bank loan  including interest operating leases total recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance allows an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although the provision of the new guidance which requires reclassifications out of comprehensive income be shown separately in the financial statements has been deferred to allow the fasb to reconsider alternatives 
we plan to adopt these requirements effective july  in may  the fasb issued additional guidance on fair value disclosures 
this guidance contains certain updates to the measurement guidance as well as enhanced disclosure requirements 
the most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for level measurements including enhanced disclosure for the valuation processes used by the reporting entity  and the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs  if any 
we adopted this guidance as of january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk qualitative disclosure about market risk 
we are exposed to certain qualitative market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these risks through regular operating and financing activities  and may  in the future  use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to date 
foreign currency risk we conduct operations in china and our functional currency in china is the renminbi yuan 
our financial statements are expressed in us dollars and will be negatively affected if foreign currencies  such as the renminbi yuan  depreciate relative to the us dollar 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by exchange control regulations in china or other countries that restrict our ability to convert into us dollars 
the people s bank of china  the monetary authority in china  sets the spot rate of the renminbi yuan  and may also use a variety of techniques  such as intervention by its central bank or imposition of regulatory controls or taxes  to affect the exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
in the future  the chinese government may also issue a new currency to replace its existing currency or alter the exchange rate or relative exchange characteristics by devaluation or revaluation of the renminbi yuan in ways that may be adverse to our interests 
commodity price risk our business plan is to purchase coal and other consumables from suppliers and to sell commodities  such as syngas  methanol and other products 
coal is the largest component of our costs of product sales and in order to mitigate coal price fluctuation risk for future projects  we expect to enter into long term contracts for coal supply or to acquire coal assets 
for the sale of commodities from our projects  fixed price contracts will not be available to us in certain markets  such as china  which will require us to purchase some portion of our coal and other consumable needs  or sell some portion of our production  into spot commodity markets or under short term supply agreements 
hedging transactions may be available to reduce our exposure to these commodity price risks  but availability may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge this exposure at all 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our loan with icbc 
interest under this loan is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china 
as of june   the applicable interest rate was 
we could also be exposed to the risk of rising interest rates through our future borrowing activities 
this is an inherent risk as borrowings mature and are renewed at then current market rates 
the extent of this risk as to our icbc loan  or any future borrowings  is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates 
customer credit risk when our projects progress to commercial production  we will be exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
to manage customer credit risk  we intend to monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
as of june   hai hua  a related party  is our only customer for syngas sales and as such  we are exposed to significant customer credit risk due to this concentration 
in addition  as described under results of operation  hai hua has not made the capacity fee payments to the zz joint venture since april the unpaid amount totals approximately million as of june  although we are continuing to work with hai hua on alternatives to resolve the issue  there can be no assurances that we will collect these amounts 
our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected if hai hua continues to not pay the capacity fee or if we are otherwise unable to retain hai hua as a customer and secure new customers 
hai hua s failure to make capacity fee payments lead us to shut down the zz joint venture plant in late september and  as described above under business current operations and projects zao zhuang joint venture  it will continue to be shut down for a period of time until we are able to either find an alternative purchaser of our production or a different use for the plant
