risk factors you should carefully consider the following information about these risks  together with the other information contained in this form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the financial statements and the notes thereto 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects could be adversely affected 
risks related to our business the current us and global economic conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and business condition 
our operations and performance depend significantly on economic conditions 
over the past three years  the u 
s 
economy has experienced a prolonged economic downturn 
while economic conditions have recently improved  there is continued uncertainty regarding the timing or strength of any economic recovery 
if the current economic situation remains weak or deteriorates further  our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our services or third party disruptions resulting from higher levels of unemployment  government budget deficits and other adverse economic conditions 
for example  loss of jobs and lack of health 
table of contents insurance as a result of the deterioration of the economy could depress demand for healthcare services generally 
patient volume trends in our staffed hospital eds could be adversely affected as individuals potentially defer or forgo seeking care in such departments due to the loss or reduction of coverage previously available to such individuals under commercial insurance or government healthcare programs 
in addition  the continuation of the current economic downturn may adversely impact our ability to collect for the services we provide as higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment may increase the number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking healthcare at one of our staffed eds 
we could also be negatively affected if the federal government or the states reduce funding of medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs in response to increasing deficits in their budgets 
for example  debt ceiling legislation enacted on august  established a bipartisan  bicameral panel to identify up to trillion in spending cuts 
the failure of that panel to reach consensus has triggered across the board cuts in medicare reimbursement starting in unless congress and the administration decide to enact a new law to modify these sequestration obligations 
additionally  private third party payers may take cost containment measures  including lowering reimbursement rates or increasing patient co payments and deductibles  which could adversely affect our business 
any of these risks  among other economic factors  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results  and the risks could become more pronounced if the problems in the us and global economies become worse 
the current us and state health reform legislative initiatives could adversely affect our operations and business condition 
on march   president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  or ppaca  which significantly affects the united states healthcare system 
one of ppaca s key goals is to increase access to health benefits for the uninsured or underinsured populations 
ppaca also includes medicare payment and delivery reforms aimed at containing costs  rewarding quality and improving outcomes through coordinated care arrangements 
for example  ppaca reduces annual payment rates for medicare providers  implements productivity adjustments to the hospital market basket update  and reduces medicare disproportionate share hospital  or dsh  payments to hospitals 
payments to hospitals will also be reduced if the hospital has excessive readmission rates or hospital acquired conditions 
ppaca requires the creation of a value based purchasing program  starting in fy  that rewards hospitals for improving on or achieving performance standards related to quality measures 
ppaca also requires the establishment of a physician value based payment system  starting on january   that would adjust payments to high performing physicians through the use of a value modifier 
in the medicare physician schedule  or mpfs  the centers for medicare medical services  or cms  finalized as the reporting period for the payment adjustment 
ppaca also provides medicare bonus payments to primary care physicians and general surgeons practicing in health professional shortage areas 
ppaca includes provisions to test new payment and delivery models  such as accountable care organizations  bundled payment arrangements  and patient centered medical homes  which require collaboration among providers and integration of care in order to reduce costs and increase quality 
there are similar reductions and reforms under the medicaid program 
some key provisions in ppaca involve new federal rules related to private health insurance offerings 
for example  there is a new review for unreasonable premium increases and new medical loss ratio obligations designed to maximize benefits to consumers 
these and other new federal rules in ppaca are expected to create pricing pressure on private health insurance premiums 
as a result  there may be pricing pressure for providers 
ppaca also includes provisions that expand and increase the government s ability to audit  investigate and combat healthcare program fraud  abuse and waste 
ppaca is currently the subject of constitutional challenges in various federal courts  as well as certain legislative initiatives to repeal the healthcare reforms implemented in some federal courts have upheld the constitutionality of ppaca or dismissed the constitutional challenges on procedural grounds 
others have held the requirement that individuals maintain health insurance or pay a penalty ie  the individual mandate to be 
table of contents unconstitutional 
those courts finding the individual mandate to be unconstitutional have either found ppaca to be void in its entirety or have struck down only the portions of the law related to the individual mandate and upheld the remaining provisions 
in november  the supreme court granted certiorari to decide whether certain provisions of ppaca are constitutional  and if not  whether the entire law must be struck down 
further  the supreme court will consider other procedural and substantive issues related to the court s ability to rule on the constitutional challenges 
oral arguments will be held in march and a decision is expected in june it is unclear what will occur in the long term with respect to these challenges  and therefore it is unclear how implementation of ppaca may be delayed or blocked in the future 
some states also have pending similar health reform legislative initiatives 
both federal and state changes to the healthcare system put pressure on our operations and business condition 
the focus on payment and delivery reforms may require us to improve efficiencies and possibly to develop new collaborative arrangements as efforts to transform healthcare delivery are tested 
laws and regulations that regulate payments for medical services made by government sponsored healthcare programs could cause our revenues to decrease 
our affiliated physician groups derive a significant portion of their net revenues less provision for uncollectibles from payments made by government sponsored healthcare programs such as medicare and state reimbursed programs 
there are public and private sector pressures to restrain healthcare costs and to restrict reimbursement rates for medical services 
any change in reimbursement policies  practices  interpretations  regulations or legislation that places limitations on reimbursement amounts or practices could significantly affect hospitals  and consequently affect our operations unless we are able to renegotiate satisfactory contractual arrangements with our hospital clients and contracted physicians 
certain changes to payor mix may also affect our revenue and business operations 
ppaca is expected to bring into the covered health benefits population approximately million new lives 
some will be covered under private health insurance 
others will be covered under new eligibility standards for medicaid 
historically and generally speaking  payment rates from private health insurance for physician services have been greater than the medicaid rates for the same services 
our revenue could be adversely impacted if states aggressively pursue lower rates or cost containment strategies as they prepare for the expansion in medicaid eligible beneficiaries at a time of increasing state budget deficits 
under medicare law cms is required to update the mpfs payment rates annually based on a formula which includes application of the sustainable growth rate  or sgr  that was adopted in the balanced budget act of this formula has yielded negative updates every year beginning in  although cms was able to take administrative steps to avert a reduction in  and congress has taken a series of legislative actions to prevent reductions from to in november  cms released the final rule to update the mpfs 
included in the final rule are changes in reimbursement that are overall budget neutral  but redistribute payments between different medical specialties 
we estimate that the final rule will reduce reimbursement rates to emergency medicine providers by and will increase reimbursement rates to anesthesiologists by 
these estimated reimbursement changes exclude any potential reduction associated with sgr changes in currently estimated to be 
unless congress and the administration act  the estimated cut will go into effect on march  any future reductions in amounts paid by government programs for physician services or changes in methods or regulations governing payment amounts or practices could cause our revenues to decline and we may not be able to offset reduced operating margins through cost reductions  increased volume or otherwise 

table of contents if governmental authorities determine that we violate medicare  medicaid or other government payer reimbursement laws or regulations  our revenues may decrease and we may have to restructure our method of billing and collecting medicare  medicaid or other government program payments  respectively 
if third party payers disallow requests for reimbursement  our revenues may decrease and our business practices may be subject to challenge 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of amended the medicare reassignment statute as of december  to permit our independent contractor physicians to reassign their right to receive medicare payments to us 
we have restructured our method of billing and collecting medicare payments in light of this statutory reassignment exception 
in addition  state medicaid programs have similar reassignment rules 
while we seek to comply substantially with applicable medicaid reassignment regulations  government authorities may find that we do not comply in all respects with these regulations 
we staff physician assistants and nurse practitioners  sometimes referred to collectively as mid level practitioners  to provide care under the supervision of physicians 
state and federal laws require that such supervision be performed and documented using specific procedures 
we believe our billing and documentation practices related to our use of mid level practitioners substantially comply with applicable state and federal laws  but enforcement authorities may find that our practices violate such laws 
when our clinicians services are covered by multiple third party payers  such as a primary and a secondary payer  financial responsibility must be allocated among the multiple payers in a process known as coordination of benefits  or cob 
the rules governing cob are complex  particularly when one of the payers is medicare or another government program 
although we believe we currently have procedures in place to assure that we comply with applicable cob rules and that we process refunds appropriately when we receive overpayments or overprovisions  payers or enforcement agencies may determine that we have violated these requirements 
reimbursement is typically conditioned on our providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting both the service itself and the medical necessity of the service 
despite our measures to ensure coding accuracy  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable  that the service was not medically necessary  that there was a lack of sufficient supporting documentation  or for other reasons 
incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information  or the incorrect selection of codes  could result in nonpayment  recoupment or allegations of billing fraud 
management is not aware of any inquiry  investigation or notice from any governmental entity indicating that we are in violation of any of the medicare  medicaid or other government payer reimbursement laws and regulations 
however  such laws and related regulations and regulatory guidance may be ambiguous or contradictory  and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that we cannot predict 
accordingly  our arrangements and business practices may be the subject of government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable laws 
we may incur substantial costs defending our interpretations of federal and state government regulations and if we lose  the government could force us to restructure our operations and subject us to fines  monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid 
our operations  including our billing and other arrangements with healthcare providers  are subject to extensive federal and state government regulation and are subject to audits  inquiries and investigations from government agencies from time to time 
such regulations include numerous laws directed at payment for services  conduct of operations  and preventing fraud and abuse  laws prohibiting general business corporations  such as us  from practicing medicine  controlling physicians medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting fees with physicians  and laws regulating billing and collection of reimbursement from 
table of contents government programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and from private payers 
those laws may have related rules and regulations that are subject to interpretation and may not provide definitive guidance as to their application to our operations  including our arrangements with hospitals  physicians and professional corporations 
see business regulatory matters 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with these laws  rules and regulations based upon what we believe are reasonable and defensible interpretations of these laws  rules and regulations 
however  federal and state laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that we cannot predict 
accordingly  our arrangements and business practices may be the subject of government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable laws 
if federal or state government officials challenge our operations or arrangements with third parties that we have structured based upon our interpretation of these laws  rules and regulations  the challenge could potentially disrupt our business operations and we may incur substantial defense costs  even if we successfully defend our interpretation of these laws  rules and regulations 
in addition  if the government successfully challenges our interpretation as to the applicability of these laws  rules and regulations as they relate to our operations and arrangements with third parties  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event regulatory action were to limit or prohibit us from carrying on our business as we presently conduct it or from expanding our operations to certain jurisdictions  we may need to make structural  operational and organizational modifications to our company and or our contractual arrangements with third party payers  physicians  professional corporations and hospitals 
our operating costs could increase significantly as a result 
we could also lose contracts or our revenues could decrease under existing contracts 
moreover  our financing agreements may also prohibit modifications to our current structure and consequently require us to obtain the consent of the holders of such indebtedness or require the refinancing of such indebtedness 
any restructuring would also negatively impact our operations because our management s time and attention would be diverted from running our business in the ordinary course 
for example  while we believe that our operations and arrangements comply substantially with existing applicable laws relating to the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting  we cannot assure you that our existing contractual arrangements  including restrictive covenant agreements with physicians  professional corporations and hospitals  will not be successfully challenged in certain states as unenforceable or as constituting the unlicensed practice of medicine or prohibited fee splitting 
in this event  we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative interpretations or to civil or criminal penalties  our contracts could be found to be legally invalid and unenforceable or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physician groups 
we and the health care providers for which we provide staffing are subject to billing investigations and audits by private payers  federal and state authorities  as well as auditing contractors for governmental programs that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
state and federal statutes impose substantial penalties  including civil and criminal fines  exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and imprisonment  on entities or individuals including any individual corporate officers or physicians deemed responsible that fraudulently or wrongfully bill governmental or other third party payers for healthcare services 
in addition  federal and certain state laws allow a private person to bring a civil action in the name of the us government for false billing violations or other types of false claims 
moreover  the federal government has contracted with private entities to audit and recover revenue resulting from payments made in excess of federal and state program requirements 
these entities include recovery audit contractors  or racs  who are responsible for auditing medicare claims  and medicaid integrity contractors  who are responsible for auditing medicaid claims 
the rac program was expanded from a demonstration to a permanent medicare program in  and was further expanded by ppaca to include medicaid and medicare parts c and d 
in addition  zone program integrity contractors  or zpics  are responsible for the identification of suspected fraud through medical record review 
we believe that additional 
table of contents audits  inquiries and investigations from government agencies will continue to occur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  including as a result of our arrangements with hospitals and healthcare providers 
in addition  we may be subject to increased audits from private payers to the extent they encounter pricing pressures related to healthcare reform 
this could result in substantial defense costs to us and a diversion of management s time and attention 
such pending or future audits  inquiries or investigations  or the public disclosure of such matters  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to complex rules and regulations that govern our licensing and certification  and the failure to comply with these rules can result in delays in  or loss of  reimbursement for our services or civil or criminal sanctions 
we  our affiliated entities  providers and the facilities in which they operate are subject to various federal  state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and accreditation standards and other laws relating to  among other things  the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel and operating policies and procedures 
we are also subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditations 
in certain jurisdictions  changes in our ownership structure require pre or post notification to governmental licensing and certification agencies 
relevant laws and regulations may also require re application and approval to maintain or renew operating authorities or require formal application and approval to continue providing services under certain government contracts 
the relevant laws and regulations are complex and may be unclear or subject to interpretation 
we are pursuing the steps we believe we must take to retain or obtain all requisite operating authorities 
while we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with federal  state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and accreditation standards based upon what we believe are reasonable and defensible interpretations of these laws  regulations and standards  agencies that administer these programs may find that we have failed to comply in some material respects 
failure to comply with these licensing  certification and accreditation laws  regulations and standards could result in our affiliated providers services being found non reimbursable or prior payments being subject to recoupment  and can give rise to civil or  in extreme cases  criminal penalties 
in order to receive payment from medicare  medicaid and certain other government programs  healthcare providers are required to enroll in these programs by completing complex enrollment applications 
certain government programs  including medicare and medicaid programs  require notice or re enrollment when certain ownership changes occur 
generally  in jurisdictions where we are required to obtain a new licensing authority  we may also be required to re enroll in that jurisdiction s government payer program 
if the payer requires us to complete the re enrollment process prior to submitting reimbursement requests  we may be delayed in receiving payment  receive refund requests or be subject to recoupment for services provided in the interim 
compliance with these change in ownership requirements is complicated by the fact that they differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  and in some cases are not uniformly applied or interpreted even within the same jurisdiction 
failure to comply with these enrollment and reporting requirements could lead not only to delays in payment and refund requests  but in extreme cases could give rise to civil including refunding of payments for services rendered or criminal penalties in connection with prior changes in our operations and ownership structure 
while we made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with these requirements in connection with prior changes in our operations and ownership structure  the agencies that administer these programs may find that we have failed to comply in some material respects 
we could be subject to professional liability lawsuits  some of which we may not be fully insured against or have reserved for  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in recent years  physicians  hospitals and other participants in the healthcare industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging medical malpractice and related legal theories such as negligent 
table of contents hiring  supervision and credentialing  and vicarious liability for acts of their employees or independent contractors 
many of these lawsuits involve large claims and substantial defense costs 
although we do not engage in the practice of medicine or provide medical services nor do we control the practice of medicine by our affiliated physicians or affiliated medical groups or the compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to such physicians and physician groups  we have been and are involved in this type of litigation  and we may become so involved in the future 
in addition  through our management of hospital departments and provision of non physician healthcare personnel  patients who receive care from physicians or other healthcare providers affiliated with medical organizations and physician groups with whom we have a contractual relationship could sue us 
effective march   we began insuring our professional liability risks principally through a program that includes self insurance reserves  commercial insurance and a captive insurance company arrangement 
under our current professional liability insurance program our exposure for claim losses under professional liability insurance policies provided to affiliated physicians and other healthcare practitioners is limited to the amounts of individual policy coverage limits 
however  in situations where we have opted to retain risk  there is generally no limitation on the exposure associated with the aggregate cost of claims that fall within individual policy limits provided to affiliated physicians and other healthcare practitioners 
also  there is no limitation on exposures for individual or aggregate professional liability losses incurred by us or other corporate entities that exceed policy loss limits under commercial insurance policies 
further  we may be exposed to individual claim losses in excess of limits of coverage under historical insurance programs 
while our provisions for professional liability claims and expenses are determined through actuarial estimates  such actuarial estimates may be exceeded by actual losses and related expenses in the future 
claims  regardless of their merit or outcome  may also adversely affect our reputation and ability to expand our business 
we could also be liable for claims against our clinicians for incidents that occurred but were not reported during periods for which claims made insurance covered the related risk 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the cost of professional liability claims  which includes the estimated costs associated with litigating or settling claims  is accrued when the incidents that give rise to the claims occur 
the accrual includes an estimate of the losses that will result from incidents  which occurred during the claims made period  but were not reported during that period 
these claims are referred to as incurred but not reported claims  or ibnr claims 
with respect to those clinicians for whom we provide coverage for claims that occurred during periods prior to march   we have acquired extended reporting period coverage  or tail coverage  for ibnr claims from a commercial insurance company 
claim losses for periods prior to march  may exceed the limits of available insurance coverage or reserves established by us for any losses in excess of such insurance coverage limits 
furthermore  for those portions of our professional liability losses that are insured through commercial insurance companies  we are subject to the credit risk of those insurance companies 
while we believe our commercial insurance company providers are currently creditworthy  such insurance companies may not remain so in the future 
the reserves that we have established for our professional liability losses are subject to inherent uncertainties and any deficiency may lead to a reduction in our net earnings 
we have established reserves for losses and related expenses that represent estimates at a given point in time involving actuarial and statistical projections of our expectations of the ultimate resolution and administration of costs of losses incurred for professional liability risks for the period on and after march  we have also established a reserve for potential losses in excess of commercial insurance aggregate coverage limits for the period prior to march  insurance reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty 
our reserves are based on historical claims  demographic factors  industry trends  severity and exposure factors and other actuarial assumptions 
studies of projected ultimate professional liability losses are performed at least annually 
we use the actuarial estimates to establish professional liability loss reserves 
our reserves could be significantly affected 
table of contents should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations 
while claims are monitored closely when estimating reserves  the complexity of the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates 
actual losses and related expenses may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
if our estimated reserves are determined to be inadequate  we will be required to increase reserves at the time of such determination  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our net earnings in the period in which such deficiency is determined 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates insurance reserves and note to the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference herein 
we depend on reimbursements by third party payers  as well as payments by individuals  which could lead to delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process 
we receive a substantial portion of our payments for healthcare services on a fee for service basis from third party payers  including medicare  medicaid  the us government s military healthcare system and other governmental programs  private insurers and managed care organizations 
we estimate that we have received approximately and of our net revenues less provision for uncollectibles from such third party payers during and  respectively 
we estimate that such amounts included approximately from medicare in both and and and from medicaid programs in and  respectively 
the reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays 
third party payers continue their efforts to control expenditures for healthcare  including proposals to revise reimbursement policies 
while we recognize revenue when healthcare services are provided  there can be delays before we receive payment 
in addition  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  that services provided were not medically necessary  that services rendered in an ed did not require ed level care or that additional supporting documentation is necessary 
retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third party payers 
we are subject to governmental audits of our reimbursement claims under medicare  medicaid  the us government s military healthcare system and other governmental programs and may be required to repay these agencies if found that we were incorrectly reimbursed 
delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process may adversely affect accounts receivable  increase the overall costs of collection and cause us to incur additional borrowing costs 
we also may not be paid with respect to co payments and deductibles that are the patient s financial responsibility or in those instances when physicians provide healthcare services to uninsured and underinsured individuals 
amounts not covered by third party payers are the obligations of individual patients from whom we may not receive whole or partial payment 
we also may not receive whole or partial payments from uninsured and underinsured individuals 
as a result of government laws and regulations requiring hospitals to screen and treat patients who have an emergency medical condition regardless of their ability to pay and our obligation to provide such screening or treatment  a substantial increase in self pay patients could result in increased costs associated with physician services for which sufficient net revenues less provision for uncollectibles are not realized to offset such additional physician service costs 
in such an event  our earnings and cash flow would be adversely affected  potentially affecting our ability to maintain our restrictive debt covenant ratios and meet our financial obligations 
we make efforts to collect from patients any co payments and other payments for services that our affiliated providers provide to the patients 
the federal fair debt collection practices act restricts the methods that companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts 
state laws vary with respect to debt collection practices  although most state requirements are similar to those under the fair debt collection practices act 
if our collection practices are viewed as inconsistent with these standards  we may be subject to damages and penalties 

table of contents while federal healthcare reform should decrease the number of uninsured and underinsured persons in future years  the risks associated with third party payers  co payments and deductibles and uninsured individuals and the inability to monitor and manage accounts receivable successfully could still have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  our collection policies or our provisions for allowances for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts receivable may not be adequate 
we are subject to the financial risks associated with fee for service contracts which could decrease our revenues  including changes in patient volume  mix of insured and uninsured patients and patients covered by government sponsored healthcare programs and third party reimbursement rates 
we derive our revenues from ed services provided by affiliated providers primarily through two types of arrangements 
if we have a flat fee contract with a hospital  the hospital bills and collects fees for physician services and remits a negotiated amount to us monthly 
if there is a fee for service contract with a hospital  either we or our affiliated providers collect the fees for professional services 
consequently  under fee for service contracts  we assume the financial risks related to changes in the mix of insured  uninsured and underinsured patients and patients covered by government sponsored healthcare programs  third party reimbursement rates and changes in patient volume 
we are subject to these risks because under fee for service contracts  fees decrease if a smaller number of patients receive physician services or if the patients who do receive services do not pay their bills for services rendered or we are not fully reimbursed for services rendered 
our fee for service contractual arrangements also involve a credit risk related to services provided to uninsured and underinsured individuals 
this risk is exacerbated in the hospital ed physician staffing context because federal law requires hospital eds to evaluate all patients regardless of the severity of illness or injury 
we believe that uninsured and underinsured patients are more likely to seek care at hospital eds because they frequently do not have a primary care physician with whom to consult 
we also collect a relatively smaller portion of our fees for services rendered to uninsured and underinsured patients than for services rendered to insured patients 
in addition  fee for service contracts also have less favorable cash flow characteristics in the start up phase than traditional flat rate contracts due to longer collection periods 
our revenues could also be reduced if third party payers successfully negotiate lower reimbursement rates for our physician services 
failure to timely or accurately bill for services could have a negative impact on our net revenues  bad debt expense and cash flow 
billing for ed visits in a hospital setting and other physician related services is complex 
the practice of providing medical services in advance of payment or  in many cases  prior to assessment of ability to pay for such services  may have a significant negative impact on our net revenues  bad debt expense and cash flow 
we bill numerous and varied payers  including self pay patients  various forms of commercial insurance companies and medicare  medicaid  the us government s military healthcare system and other government programs 
these different payers typically have differing forms of billing requirements that must be met prior to receiving payment for services rendered 
reimbursement to us is typically conditioned on our providing the proper procedure and diagnosis codes 
incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information could result in non payment for services rendered 
additional factors that could complicate our billing include disputes between payers as to which party is responsible for payment  variation in coverage for similar services among various payers  the difficulty of adherence to specific compliance requirements  coding and various other procedures mandated by responsible parties  failure to obtain proper physician enrollment and documentation in order to bill various commercial and governmental payers  
table of contents failure to identify and obtain the proper insurance coverage for the patient  and failure to properly code for services rendered 
to the extent that the complexity associated with billing for our services causes delays in our cash collections  we assume the financial risk of increased carrying costs associated with the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the increased potential for bad debts 
in addition  the majority of the patient visits for which we bill payers are processed in one of three regional billing centers 
a disruption of services at any one of these locations could result in a delay in billing and thus cash flows to us  as well as potential additional costs to process billings in alternative settings or locations 
in  our billing centers processed approximately of our patient visit billings using a common automated billing system 
while we employ what we believe are adequate back up alternatives in the event of a main computer site disaster  failure to execute our back up plan successfully or timely may cause a significant disruption to our cash flows and temporarily increase our billing costs 
in the event that we do not timely or accurately bill for our services  our net revenues may be subject to a significant negative impact 
if we are unable to timely enroll healthcare professionals in the medicare program  our collections and revenues will be harmed 
in the mpfs  cms substantially reduced the time within which physicians and other healthcare professionals can retrospectively bill medicare for services provided by such providers from months prior to the effective date of the enrollment to days prior to the effective date of the billing privileges 
in addition  the new enrollment rules set forth in the mpfs provide that the effective date of the enrollment will be the later of the date on which the enrollment was filed and approved by the medicare contractor and the date on which the healthcare professional began providing services 
ppaca also adds new screening requirements for enrollment and re enrollment  as well as enhanced oversight periods for new providers and suppliers  and new requirements for medicare and medicaid program providers and suppliers to establish compliance programs 
if we are unable to properly enroll our physicians and other healthcare professionals within the days after such provider begins providing services  we will be precluded from billing medicare for any services that were provided to a medicare beneficiary more than thirty days prior to the effective date of the enrollment 
such failure to timely enroll healthcare professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a reclassification of our independent contractor physicians by tax authorities could require us to pay retroactive taxes and penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
as of december   we contracted with approximately  affiliated physicians as independent contractors to fulfill our contractual obligations to clients 
because we consider many of the physicians with whom we contract to be independent contractors  as opposed to employees  we do not withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes  make federal or state unemployment tax or federal insurance contributions act payments  or provide workers compensation insurance with respect to such affiliated physicians 
our contracts with our independent contractor physicians obligate these physicians to pay these taxes 
the classification of physicians as independent contractors depends on the facts and circumstances of the relationship 
in the event federal or state taxing authorities determine that the physicians engaged as independent contractors are employees  we may be adversely affected and subject to retroactive taxes and penalties 
under current federal tax law  a safe harbor from reclassification  and consequently retroactive taxes and penalties  is available if our current treatment is consistent with a long standing practice of a significant segment of our industry and if we meet certain other requirements 
if challenged  we may not prevail in demonstrating the applicability of the safe harbor to our operations 
further  interested persons have recently proposed to eliminate the safe harbor and may do so again in the future 
if such proposals are reintroduced and passed by congress  they could impact our classification of independent contractor physician which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our practices with respect to the classification of our independent contractors have periodically been reviewed by the internal revenue service  or irs  with no adjustments or changes to our practices required as a result of such review 
the irs completed its most recent review of our affiliated entities in with no proposed changes 
the irs relied on the results of prior reviews in and and our adherence to the conditions of the safe harbor provisions 
nonetheless  the tax authorities may decide to reclassify our independent contractor physicians as employees or require us to pay retroactive taxes and penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant number of our programs are concentrated in certain states  particularly florida and tennessee  which makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory  economic and other conditions in those states 
during the year ended december   florida and tennessee accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues less provision for uncollectibles 
if our programs in these states are adversely affected by changes in regulatory  economic and other conditions or natural disasters in such states  our revenues and profitability may decline 
we derive a portion of our net revenues from services provided to the us department of defense within the military health system program  or mhs program 
these revenues are derived from contracts subject to a competitive bidding process 
we are a provider of healthcare professionals that serve military personnel and their dependents in military treatment facilities nationwide 
our net revenues derived from military healthcare staffing totaled million in  million in and million in during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a non tax deductible charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with this division 
most of our contracts within the mhs program have a term of one year 
under a number of these contracts  the government has the option to renew the contract each year for an additional one year term  subject to a specified maximum number of renewal terms anywhere from one to four renewal terms 
those contracts without any renewal option are subject to an automatic rebidding and award process at the end of the one year term 
each contract with a renewal option will become subject to the automatic rebidding and award process upon the earlier of i the government electing not to exercise its annual renewal option of such contract or ii the expiration of the final renewal term for such contract 
in addition  all contracts  including contracts with renewal options  can be terminated by the government at any time without notice 
the outcome of any rebidding and award process is uncertain and we may not be awarded new contracts 
our contracts with renewal options may not be so renewed and the government may exercise its rights to terminate the contracts 
in addition  we provide services within the mhs program pursuant to subcontracting arrangements where we serve as a subcontractor to a primary contractor  generally a small business  that has entered into a direct contract with the government 
subcontracting arrangements pose unique risks to us because our ability to generate revenue under the subcontract is contingent upon the continued existence of the primary contract  which is beyond our control 
if the primary contract is terminated  whether for non performance by the primary contractor  the loss of the primary contractor s small business status or otherwise  then our subcontract will similarly terminate 
any loss of or failure to renew contracts within the mhs program may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may become involved in litigation that could harm the value of our business 
in the normal course of our business  we are involved in lawsuits  claims  audits and investigations  including those arising out of services provided  personal injury claims  professional liability claims  our billing and marketing practices  employment disputes and contractual claims 
the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not believe that any such claims 
table of contents that have been asserted are likely to have such an effect 
however  we may become subject to future lawsuits  claims  audits and investigations that could result in substantial costs and divert our attention and resources 
in addition  since our current growth strategy includes acquisitions  among other things  we may become exposed to legal claims arising out of the activities of an acquired business prior to the time of any acquisition 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may cause the value of our common stock to decline  which could affect our ability to raise new capital for our business 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future depending on many factors that may include  but are not limited to  the following the overall patient demand for healthcare services  our ability to accurately receive and process on a timely basis billing related information and other demographic factors that in turn can affect our fee for service revenue estimates  the relative proportion of revenues we derive from various services  increased competition in our local markets  changes in our operating expenses  our ability to recruit and train new physicians in new or existing local markets  changes in our business strategy  and economic and political conditions  including fluctuations in interest rates and tax increases 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our ability to raise new capital for our business 
our revenues could be adversely affected by a net loss of contracts 
a significant portion of our growth has historically resulted from increases in the number of patient visits and fees for services provided under existing contracts and the addition and acquisition of new contracts 
our contracts with hospitals for ed staffing generally have terms of three years and include automatic renewal options under similar terms and conditions  unless either party gives notice of an intent not to renew 
most of these contracts are terminable by either of the parties upon notice of as little as days 
these contracts may not be renewed or  if renewed  may contain terms that are not as favorable to us as our current contracts 
in most cases  the termination of a contract is principally due to either an award of the contract to another source of provider staffing or termination of the contract by us due to a lack of an acceptable profit margin 
additionally  to a much lesser extent  contracts may be terminated due to such conditions as a hospital facility closing because of facility mergers or a hospital attempting to provide themselves the service being provided by us 
our current military contracts  which are in the form of direct contracts with military treatment facilities  generally have terms of one year and in many cases grant renewal options to the military 
such renewal options typically are for one to four years 
we may experience a net loss of contracts in the future and any such net loss may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our failure to accurately assess the costs we will incur under new contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our new contracts increasingly involve a competitive bidding process 
when we obtain new contracts  we must accurately assess the costs we will incur in providing services in order to realize adequate profit margins and otherwise meet our financial and strategic objectives 
increasing pressures from healthcare payers to restrict or reduce reimbursement rates at a time when the costs of providing medical services continue to increase make assessing the costs associated with the pricing of new contracts  as well as maintenance of existing contracts  more difficult 
in addition  integrating new contracts  particularly those in new geographic locations  could prove 
table of contents more costly  and could require more management time than we anticipate 
our failure to accurately predict costs or to negotiate an adequate profit margin could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to find suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate completed acquisitions into our current operations  we may not be able to profitably operate our consolidated company 
between and  acquisitions have contributed approximately toward overall growth in net revenues less provision for uncollectibles during this period 
we expect to continue to seek opportunities to grow through attractive acquisitions 
however  our acquisition strategy could present some challenges 
some of the difficulties we could encounter include problems identifying all service and contractual commitments of the acquired entity  evaluating the stability of the acquired entity s hospital contracts  integrating financial and operational software  accurately projecting physician and employee costs  and evaluating their regulatory compliance 
our acquisition strategy is also subject to the risk that  in the future  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  be successful in expanding into new lines of business  obtain acceptable financing or consummate desired acquisitions  any of which could inhibit our growth 
additionally  we compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers  some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do 
this competition may intensify due to the ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry  which may increase our acquisition costs 
also  we may acquire individual or group medical practices that operate with lower profit margins as compared with our current or expected profit margins or which have a different payor mix than our other practice groups  which would reduce our profit margins 
we may also incur or assume indebtedness or issue equity in connection with acquisitions 
the issuance of shares of our common stock for an acquisition may result in dilution to our existing shareholders and depending on the number of shares that we issue  the resale of such shares could affect the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  in connection with acquisitions  we may need to obtain the consent of third parties who have contracts with the entity to be acquired  such as managed care companies or hospitals contracting with the entity 
we may be unable to obtain these consents 
if we fail to integrate acquired operations  fail to manage the cost of providing our services or fail to price our services appropriately  our operating results may decline 
furthermore  the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
finally  as a result of our acquisitions of other healthcare businesses  we may be subject to the risk of unanticipated business uncertainties or legal liabilities relating to such acquired businesses for which we may not be indemnified by the sellers of the acquired businesses 
if we fail to implement our business strategy  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
our business strategy envisions several initiatives  including increasing revenues from existing customers  capitalizing on outsourcing opportunities to win new contracts  focusing on risk management and pursuing selected acquisitions 
we may not be able to implement our business strategy successfully or achieve the anticipated benefits of our business plan 
if we are unable to do so  our long term growth and profitability may be adversely affected 
even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business plan successfully  our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate  or at all 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
even if we are successful in obtaining new business  failure to manage our growth could adversely affect our financial condition 
we may experience extended periods of very rapid growth 
if we are not able to manage our growth effectively  our business and financial condition could materially suffer 
our growth may significantly strain our managerial  operational and financial resources and systems 
to manage our growth 
table of contents effectively  we will have to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
in addition  we must effectively expand  train and manage our employees 
we will be unable to manage our businesses effectively if we are unable to alleviate the strain on resources caused by growth in a timely and successful manner 
we may not be able to manage our growth and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be required to seek additional financing to meet our future capital needs and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our competitive position  business  financial condition and results of operations 
continued expansion of our business may require additional capital 
in the future  it is possible that we will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil  characterized by the bankruptcy  failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the us and other governments 
these events have led to unparalleled levels of volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets and have significantly adversely impacted global economic conditions  resulting in additional  significant recessionary pressures and further declines in investor confidence and economic growth 
despite significant government intervention  global investor confidence remains low and credit remains relatively scarce 
these disruptions in the financial markets  including the bankruptcy and restructuring of certain financial institutions  may adversely impact the current availability of credit and the availability and cost of credit in the future 
accordingly  if we need to seek additional funding  we may be significantly reduced in our ability to attract public or private financings or financial partners or relationships as a source of additional capital 
in addition  this additional funding  if needed  may not be available on terms attractive to us  if at all 
furthermore  any additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to raise additional capital or operate our business 
our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our competitive position  business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to successfully recruit and retain qualified physicians and other healthcare providers to serve as our independent contractors or employees  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
our affiliated medical groups provide facility based services in virtually all types of settings 
these include urban and suburban hospitals as well as rural and remote facilities 
our ability to recruit and retain affiliated physicians and qualified personnel for such settings can significantly affect our performance at such facilities 
certain of these locations present difficulties in recruiting providers due to limits on compensation  facility and equipment availability  reduced back up by other specialists and personal and family lifestyle preferences 
in addition  a number of our client hospitals increasingly demand a greater degree of specialized skills  training and experience in the physicians who staff their contracts 
this decreases the number of physicians who are qualified to staff potential and existing contracts 
in general  recruiting physicians to staff contracts in regions of the country for economically disadvantaged hospitals is challenging 
occasionally  the recruiting of providers may not occur quickly enough to fill all openings with permanent staff 
in these situations  clinical shifts are often filled temporarily by our existing clinicians from other areas of our company 
if such assistance is not available for any reason  we utilize staffing from our locum tenens company to fill the staffing need until a permanent candidate is identified 
finally  if the aforementioned alternatives are unsuccessful  we contract with one of the many third party locum tenens companies that exist to provide these services to healthcare facilities or companies such as ours 
our ability to attract and retain clinicians depends on several factors  including our ability to provide competitive benefits and wages 
if we do not increase benefits and wages in response to increases by our competitors  we could face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified healthcare personnel 
in addition  if we 
table of contents raise wages in response to our competitors wage increases and are unable to pass such increases on to our clients  our margins could decline  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  our ability to recruit physicians is closely regulated 
for example  the types  amount and duration of assistance we can provide to recruited physicians are limited by the stark law  the anti kickback statutes  state anti kickback statutes  and related regulations 
for example  the stark law requires  among other things  that recruitment assistance can only be provided to physicians who meet certain geographic and practice requirements  that the amount of assistance cannot be changed during the term of the recruitment agreement  and that the recruitment payments cannot generally benefit physicians currently in practice in the community beyond recruitment costs actually incurred by them 
in addition to these legal requirements  there is competition from other communities and facilities for these physicians  and this competition continues after the physician is practicing in one of our communities 
our non competition and non solicitation contractual arrangements with some affiliated physicians and professional corporations may be successfully challenged in certain states as unenforceable  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have contracts with physicians in many states 
state laws governing non competition and non solicitation agreements vary from state to state 
some states prohibit non competition and non solicitation contractual arrangements with physicians or are otherwise reluctant to strictly enforce such agreements 
in such event  we would be unable to prevent former affiliated physicians and professional corporations from soliciting our contracts or otherwise competing with us  potentially resulting in the loss of some of our hospital contracts and other business which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the high level of competition in our industry could adversely affect our contract and revenue base 
the provision of outsourced physician staffing and administrative services to hospitals and clinics is characterized by a high degree of competition 
competition for outsourced physician and other healthcare staffing and administrative service contracts is based primarily on the ability to improve department productivity and patient satisfaction while reducing overall costs  the breadth of staffing and management services offered  the ability to recruit and retain qualified physicians  technicians and other healthcare providers  billing and reimbursement expertise  a reputation for compliance with state and federal regulations  and financial stability  demonstrating an ability to pay providers in a timely manner and provide professional liability insurance 
such competition could adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts  retain existing contracts and increase our profit margins 
we compete with national and regional healthcare services companies and physician groups 
in addition  some of these entities may have greater access than we do to physicians and potential clients 
all of these competitors provide healthcare services that are similar in scope to some  if not all  of the services we provide 
although we and our competitors operate on a national or regional basis  the majority of the targeted hospital community for our services engages local physician practice groups to provide services similar to the services we provide 
we therefore also compete against local physician groups and self operated hospital eds for satisfying staffing and scheduling needs 
the military has changed its approach toward providing most of its outsourced healthcare staffing needs through direct provider contracting on a competitive bid basis 
as a result  competition for such outsourced military staffing contracts may be affected by such factors as the lowest bid price  
table of contents the ability to meet technical government bid specifications  the ability to recruit and retain qualified healthcare providers  and restrictions on the ability to competitively bid based on restrictive government bid lists or bid specifications designed to award government contracts to targeted business ownership forms  such as those determined to meet small business or minority ownership qualifications 
our services and quality screening considerations may not result in the lowest competitive bid price and thus result in a failure to win contracts where the decision is based strictly on pricing considerations 
our business depends on numerous complex information systems  some of which are licensed from third parties  and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems or any disruptions in our information systems could materially harm our operations 
our business depends on complex  integrated information systems and standardized procedures for operational  financial and billing operations 
we may not be able to enhance existing information systems or implement new information systems where necessary 
additionally  we license certain of our information systems  and these licenses may be terminated  or may no longer be available at all or on terms that are acceptable to us 
furthermore  we may experience unanticipated delays  complications and expenses in implementing  integrating and operating our systems 
in addition  our information systems may require modifications  improvements or replacements that may require substantial expenditures and may require interruptions in operations during periods of implementation 
implementation of these systems is further subject to the availability of information technology and skilled personnel to assist us in creating and implementing the systems 
we also provide certain vendors either within the us or abroad with limited access to portions of our complex information systems 
any system failure that causes disruption in  or availability of  our information systems could adversely affect our operations 
although our information systems are protected through a secure hosting facility and additional backup remote processing capabilities also exist in the event our primary systems fail  our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  cyberattacks  disruptions caused by unauthorized tampering or outages caused by natural disasters 
in the event our systems remain inaccessible for an extended period of time  our ability to maintain billing and clinical records reliably  bill for services efficiently  maintain our accounting and financial reporting accurately and otherwise conduct our operations would be impaired 
furthermore  our operations rely on the reliable and secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
in the event we experience security breaches of our information systems  we could be subject to liabilities under privacy and security laws and suffer significant reputational harm 
although we believe we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place  we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 
there are evolving standards in the healthcare industry relating to electronic medical records and e prescribing 
in  both the oig and cms issued exceptions to the stark law and safe harbors to the federal anti kickback statute for certain e prescribing arrangements and established the conditions under which entities may donate to physicians and certain other recipients under the safe harbor interoperable electronic health records software  information technology and training services 
additionally  the rules permit hospitals and certain other entities to provide physicians and certain other recipients under the safe harbor with hardware  software  or information technology and training services necessary and used solely for electronic prescribing 
both rules are permissive  meaning that if requirements are met  they permit the offering or furnishing of free or discounted technology to referral sources 
however  the government has signaled its interest in making certain universal e prescribing and electronic health records mandatory 
new legislation enacted under the health information technology for economic and clinical health act  or hitech act  of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or arra  requires the government to work to adopt standards based electronic health 
table of contents records 
final regulations issued in july establish the technical capabilities required for certified electronic health records  as well as meaningful use objectives that providers must meet to qualify for bonus payments under the medicare program 
cms is also in the process of issuing a series of regulations designed to streamline health care administrative transactions  encourage greater use of standards by providers  and make existing standards work more effectively 
we are devoting significant resources to facilitate connectivity to hospital systems or otherwise develop e prescribing and electronic medical record capabilities 
the failure to successfully implement and maintain operational  financial and billing information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and services  which form the basis of our complex information systems  our competitive position could be adversely affected 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and services 
to do so  we rely upon a combination of trade secret  copyright  trade and service mark  and patent law  as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions 
these legal means  however  afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and services  unauthorized persons may be able to copy  reverse engineer or otherwise use some of our technology or services 
it is also possible that others will develop and market similar or better technology or services to compete with us 
for these reasons  we may have difficulty protecting our proprietary technology and services 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology and services  which is often costly  time consuming and a diversion of management s attention from our business 
loss of key personnel and or failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could make it more difficult for us to generate cash flow from operations and service our debt 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our core senior management team of h 
lynn massingale  md  executive chairman  greg roth  president and chief executive officer  david jones  executive vice president  chief financial officer  heidi allen  senior vice president  general counsel  oliver rogers  president  hospital based services  and joseph carman  chief administrative officer as well as the leaders of major components of our company 
if one or more of these individuals were unable or unwilling to continue in his present position  our business would be disrupted and we might not be able to find replacements on a timely basis or with the same level of skill and experience 
finding and hiring any such replacements could be costly and might require us to grant significant incentive compensation  which could adversely impact our financial results 
we may be subject to criminal or civil sanctions if we fail to comply with privacy regulations regarding the use and disclosure of patient information 
numerous state  federal and international laws and regulations govern the collection  dissemination  use  privacy  confidentiality  security  availability and integrity of patient health information  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
in the provision of services to our customers  we and our third party vendors either within the us or abroad may collect  use  maintain and transmit patient health information in ways that are subject to many of these laws and regulations 
the three rules that were promulgated pursuant to hipaa that could most significantly affect our business are the standards for electronic transactions  or transactions rule  the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy rule  and the security standards for the protection of electronic protected health information  or security rule 
hipaa applies to covered entities  which include our professional corporations and lay corporations that employ physicians to furnish professional medical services  and most healthcare facilities and health plans that 
table of contents contract with us for our services 
other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy of patient health information also apply to us directly by law or indirectly through contractual obligations to our customers that are directly subject to the laws 
the transactions rule establishes format and data content standards for eight of the most common healthcare transactions 
when we perform billing and collection services on behalf of our customers  we may be engaging in one or more of these standard transactions and are required to conduct those transactions in compliance with the required standards 
the privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information  requires entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information 
the security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient health information transmitted or stored electronically 
the privacy rule and security rule require the development and implementation of detailed policies  procedures  contracts and forms to assure compliance 
we have implemented such compliance measures  but we may be required to make additional costly system purchases and modifications to comply with evolving hipaa rules and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
the national provider identifier rule establishes the standard for a unique health identifier for healthcare providers for use in the healthcare system along with implementation specifications for obtaining and using the identifier 
in general  this rule requires a covered healthcare provider and any subpart of the covered entity that would be a covered healthcare provider if it were a separate legal entity  to apply for a provider identifier and use it in the standard transactions 
we completed the process of obtaining the necessary national provider identifiers  or npis  for our existing providers in  and continue to seek npis for new providers  as necessary 
the hipaa rules also require covered entities to contractually obligate certain of their contractors who may receive protected health information during the course of rendering services on behalf of that entity  to abide by certain burdensome business associate contract requirements 
we enter into these contracts as business associates of our customers who contract for the use of our protocols and services and with vendors who perform services on our behalf 
arra and regulations that are being promulgated under arra include additional requirements related to the privacy and security of patient health information 
as part of these additional requirements  arra extends compliance with the privacy rule and security rule to business associates  requires  in certain instances  the reporting of incidents to individuals  the secretary of hhs and  in some circumstances  the media  where the security of patient health information has been compromised  and provides state attorneys general with enforcement authority for the privacy rule and security rule 
we face potential administrative  civil and criminal sanctions if we do not comply with the existing or new laws and regulations  as well as possible harm to our reputation 
imposition of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
federal and state consumer laws are being applied increasingly by the federal trade commission  or ftc  and state attorneys general to regulate the collection  use and disclosure of personal or patient health information  through web sites or otherwise  and to regulate the presentation of web site content 
courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the ftc that concern consumer notice  choice  security and access 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality  privacy  availability  integrity and security of patient information 
these laws in many cases are more restrictive than  and not preempted by  the hipaa rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies  creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense  adverse publicity and liability 
we may not remain in compliance with the diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business 

table of contents new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa  congressional action or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle healthcare related data  and the cost of complying with standards could be significant 
if we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information  we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions 
see business regulatory matters 
if we fail to comply with federal or state anti kickback laws  we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties  loss of licenses and exclusion from medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
section b b of the social security act  or ssa  commonly referred to as the anti kickback statute  prohibits the offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring  ordering  leasing  purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering  purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by the medicare and medicaid programs or any other federally funded healthcare program 
the anti kickback statute is very broad in scope  and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by courts or regulations 
in the operation of our business  we pay various healthcare providers or other referral sources for items or services they provide to us  and healthcare providers or other referral sources pay us for items or services we provide to them 
in addition  we have non financial relationships with referral sources 
all of our financial relationships with healthcare providers and other referral sources  and with referral recipients such as service agreements  equipment leases and space leases potentially implicate the anti kickback statute  and some of our non financial relationships may implicate the anti kickback statute 
in addition  most of the states in which we operate also have adopted laws similar to the anti kickback statute  although some of them are broader and apply regardless of the source of payment for the item or service provided 
violations of the anti kickback statute and similar state laws may result in significant fines  imprisonment and exclusion from the medicare  medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs 
such fines and exclusion could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we believe that our arrangements with healthcare providers and other referral sources and recipients fall within applicable safe harbors or otherwise do not violate the law  there can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory authorities will not challenge these arrangements under anti kickback laws 
see business regulatory matters 
if the oig  the department of justice or other federal regulators determine that certain of our management services arrangements with hospitals where we are compensated based upon a percentage of charges generated by the physician services rendered to patients at the hospital violate the anti kickback statute  we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties  loss of licenses and exclusion from medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the operation of our business  we provide outsourced physician staffing and administrative services to hospitals and other healthcare providers through contractual arrangements with physicians and hospitals 
in some instances  we may enter into contractual arrangements that provide that  as compensation for staffing a hospital department  we will receive a percentage of charges generated by the physician services rendered to patients seeking treatment in the department 
in  the oig issued an advisory opinion in which it concluded that a proposed management services contract between a medical practice management company and a physician practice  which provided that the management company would be reimbursed for the fair market value of its operating services and its costs and paid a percentage of net practice revenues  may constitute illegal remuneration under the anti kickback statute 

table of contents the oig s analysis focused on the marketing activities conducted by the management company and concluded that the management services arrangement described in the advisory opinion included financial incentives to increase patient referrals  contained no safeguards against overutilization and included financial incentives that increased the risk of abusive billing practices 
while we believe that the nature of our business and our contractual relationships with hospitals and physicians are distinguishable from the arrangement described in this advisory opinion with regard to both the types of services provided and the risk factors identified by the oig  regulatory authorities may challenge these arrangements under the anti kickback statute 
violations of the anti kickback statute may result in significant fines  imprisonment and exclusion from the medicare  medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs 
such fines and exclusion could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to comply with federal and state physician self referral laws and regulations as they are currently interpreted or may be interpreted in the future  or if other legislative restrictions are issued  we could incur a significant loss of reimbursement revenue and be subject to significant monetary penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that limit the circumstances under which physicians who have a financial relationship with entities that furnish certain specified healthcare services may refer to such entities for the provision of such services  including inpatient and outpatient hospital services  clinical laboratory services  home health services  physical therapy services  occupational and physical therapy services  radiology and other imaging services and certain other diagnostic services 
these laws and regulations also prohibit such entities from billing for services provided in violation of the laws and regulations 
we have financial relationships with physicians and hospitals in the form of compensation arrangements for services rendered 
in addition  we have financial relationships with physicians to the extent they own an equity interest in us 
while we believe our compensation arrangements with physicians and hospitals are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations  government authorities might take a contrary position or prohibited referrals may occur 
further  because we cannot be certain that we will have knowledge of all physicians who may hold an indirect ownership interest  referrals from any such physicians may cause us to violate these laws and regulations 
violation of these laws and regulations may result in the prohibition of payment for services rendered  significant fines and penalties  and exclusion from medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  expansion of our operations to new jurisdictions  new interpretations of laws in our existing jurisdictions or new physician self referral laws could require structural and organizational modifications of our relationships with physicians to comply with those jurisdictions laws 
such structural and organizational modifications could result in lower profitability and failure to achieve our growth objectives 
see business regulatory matters 
we could experience a loss of contracts with physicians or be required to sever relationships with our affiliated professional corporations in order to comply with antitrust laws 
our contracts with physicians include contracts with physicians organized as separate legal professional entities eg  professional medical corporations and as individuals 
as such  the antitrust laws deem each such physician practice to be separate  both from us and from each other and  accordingly  each such physician practice is subject to a wide range of laws that prohibit anti competitive conduct among separate legal entities or individuals 
a review or action by regulatory authorities or the courts that is negative in nature as to the relationship between us and the physicians practices with which we contract  could force us to terminate our contractual relationships with physicians and affiliated professional corporations 
since we derive a significant 
table of contents portion of our revenues from these relationships  our revenues could substantially decrease 
moreover  if any review or action by regulatory authorities required us to modify our structure and organization to comply with such action or review  our debt covenants may not permit such modifications  thereby requiring us to obtain the consent of the holders of such indebtedness or requiring the refinancing of such indebtedness 
if changes in laws or regulations affect our operations  including our arrangements with physicians  professional corporations  hospitals and other facilities  and third party payers  we may incur additional costs  lose contracts and suffer a reduction in revenue under existing contracts and we may need to refinance our debt or obtain debt holder consent 
legislators have introduced and may introduce in the future numerous proposals in the us congress and state legislatures relating to various healthcare issues 
we do not know the ultimate content  timing or effect of any healthcare legislation  nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation 
further  although we exercise care in structuring our arrangements with physicians  professional corporations  hospitals and other facilities to comply in all significant respects with applicable law government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing those laws may assert that we  or arrangements into which we have entered  violate those laws or governmental entities or courts may not ultimately interpret those laws in a manner consistent with our interpretation 
in addition to the regulations referred to above  aspects of our operations are also subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing workplace health and safety and  to a small extent  the disposal of medical waste 
changes in ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional and trade associations and private accreditation commissions such as the american medical association and the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations may also affect our operations 
accordingly  changes in existing laws and regulations  adverse judicial or administrative interpretations of these laws and regulations or enactment of new legislation could adversely affect our operations 
if restructuring our relationships becomes necessary  this could cause our operating costs to increase significantly 
a restructuring could also result in a loss of contracts or a reduction in revenues under existing contracts 
moreover  if these laws require us to modify our structure and organization to comply with these laws  our financing agreements may prohibit such modifications and require us to obtain the consent of the holders of such indebtedness or require the refinancing of such indebtedness 
risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  our ability to operate our business  react to changes in the economy or our industry and pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december  our total indebtedness was million  excluding million of availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility without giving effect to million of undrawn letters of credit which reduces availability 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in this form k 
a increase in the expected rate of interest under our senior secured credit facilities would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
our substantial debt could have important consequences  including the following it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  including debt service requirements under our outstanding debt  
table of contents our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes may be impaired  requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations  capital expenditures  future business opportunities and other purposes  we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business or industry is more limited  our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures  as compared to our competitors  may be compromised due to our high level of debt and the restrictive covenants in our credit agreement  our ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance debt may be limited  and it may cause potential or existing customers or physicians to not contract with us due to concerns over our ability to meet our financial obligations  such as the payment of physicians or insuring against our professional liability risks  under such contracts 
furthermore  all of our debt under our senior secured credit facilities bears interest at variable rates 
we are subject to an increase in rates under our term a loan and revolving credit facility in the event our leverage ratio increases 
if these rates were to increase significantly  the risks related to our substantial debt would intensify 
despite current indebtedness levels  we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt  which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although our credit agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
if we incur additional debt above the levels currently in effect  the risks associated with our leverage  including those described above  would increase 
the senior secured revolving credit facility provides aggregate availability of up to million  of which million was drawn excluding million in undrawn outstanding letters of credit which reduces availability as of december  servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control  and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to service our debt obligations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors and reimbursement actions of governmental and commercial payers  all of which are beyond our control 
lower net revenues  or higher provision for uncollectibles  generally will reduce our cash flow 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt  sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital 
we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements 
in addition  the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 

table of contents restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies  and failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in acceleration of our debt 
the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our senior secured credit facilities may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
the senior secured credit facilities limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our common stock or make other restricted payments  make certain investments  sell certain assets  create liens on certain assets  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  and designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
in addition  the senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain certain financial ratios including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and satisfy other financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we may not be able to meet those ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit agreement  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders under the senior secured credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior secured credit agreement 
our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with the covenants in the senior secured credit agreement or any other indebtedness and we may not have sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit agreement as well as our unsecured indebtedness 
in addition  in the event of an acceleration  we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments 
a decline in our operating results or available cash could cause us to experience difficulties in complying with covenants contained in more than one agreement  which could result in our bankruptcy or liquidation 
if we were to sustain a decline in our operating results or available cash  we could experience difficulties in complying with the financial covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement 
for example  the loss of a significant portion of our existing military staffing business that is subject to the re bidding process or a failure to mitigate such loss by winning new business as it is submitted for bid to the military may cause us difficulty in complying with such covenants 
the failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the senior secured credit agreement and by reason of cross acceleration or cross default provisions  other indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable 
in addition  should an event of default occur  the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder  cease making loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
if our operating performance declines  we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our senior secured credit agreement to avoid being in default 
if we breach our covenants under our senior secured credit agreement and seek a waiver  we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders 
if this occurs  we would be in default under our senior secured credit agreement  the lenders could exercise their rights  as described above  and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

table of contents risks related to our common stock future sales of our common stock or the possibility or perception of such future sales may depress our stock price

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of outsourced healthcare professional staffing and administrative services to hospitals and other healthcare providers in the united states  based upon revenues and patient visits 
our regional operating models also include comprehensive programs for inpatient care  pediatrics and other healthcare services  principally within hospital departments and other healthcare treatment facilities 
we have focused  however  primarily on providing outsourced services to hospital eds  which accounts for the majority of our net revenues 
the corporate conversion effective december   we converted from a limited liability company to a corporation in connection with our initial public offering 
in addition to converting class a units  class b units and class c units into common stock  each holder of class b units and class c units was also issued vested and unvested options to acquire shares of our common stock in substitution for part of the economic benefits of their outstanding class b units or class c units not reflected in the conversion of the units into shares of common stock  with the exercise price of these options equal to the initial public offering price or such higher price as was necessary to accurately reflect the terms of the class b units or class c units to which they relate 
the common stock received in the conversion associated with unvested class b units and class c units and the unvested options are subject to the same vesting schedule that was previously applied to the class b units or class c units to which they relate 
a total of million of pre tax non cash share based compensation expense was and will be recognized in connection with a portion of these option grants 
approximately million of this expense was recognized in december  million during and million during with the remaining million of expense to be amortized over the vesting period of the applicable common stock and options

factors and trends that affect our results of operations in reading our financial statements  you should be aware of the following factors and trends that we believe are important in understanding our financial performance 
general economic conditions the continuation of the current economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to collect for the services we provide as higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care and governmental healthcare enrollment may increase the number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking healthcare at one of our staffed eds 
we could be negatively affected if the federal government or the states reduce funding of medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs in response to increasing deficits in their budgets 
also  patient volume trends in our hospital eds could be adversely affected as individuals potentially defer or forego seeking care in such departments due to the loss or reduction of coverage previously available to such individuals under commercial insurance or governmental healthcare programs 
healthcare reform the president of the united states and members of the us congress have enacted significant reforms to the us healthcare system 
on march   the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  and on march   the president signed into law the health care and education reconciliation act of referred to collectively as the health reform laws 
the health reform laws include a number of provisions that may affect us  although the impact of many of the changes will be unknown until they are implemented  which in some cases will not occur for several years 
the impact of some of these provisions may be positive  such as increasing access to health benefits for the uninsured and underinsured populations  while other provisions such as medicare payment reforms and reductions that could reduce provider payments may have an adverse effect on the reimbursement rates we receive for services provided by affiliated healthcare professionals 
medicare fee schedule changes the medicare program reimburses for our services based upon the rates in its physician fee schedule  and each year the medicare program updates the physician fee schedule reimbursement rates based on a formula approved by congress in the balanced budget act of many private payers use the medicare fee schedule to determine their own reimbursement rates 
the medicare law requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to adjust the medicare physician fee schedule mpfs payment rates annually based on an update formula which includes application of the sustainable growth rate sgr that was adopted in the balanced budget act of this formula has yielded negative updates every year beginning in  although cms was able to take administrative steps to avoid a reduction in and congress took a series of legislative actions to prevent reductions each year from to  including a two month extension of the rates through february however  absent regulatory changes or further congressional action with respect to the application of the sgr  medicare physician services will be subject to significant reductions beginning in march  in november  cms released the final rule to update the mpfs 
included in the final rule are changes in reimbursement that are overall budget neutral  but redistribute payments between different medical specialties 
we estimate that the final rule will reduce reimbursement rates to emergency medicine providers by and will increase reimbursement rates to anesthesiologists by 
these estimated reimbursement changes exclude any potential reduction associated with sgr changes in currently estimated to be 

table of contents we estimate the impact on our ed fee for service revenue to be a decline of approximately million 
also included in the cms regulations is a reduction in the physician quality reporting initiative pqri bonus payments 
the impact on our revenue is estimated to be a million decline as compared to revenue 
any future reductions in amounts paid by government programs for physician services or changes in methods or regulations governing payment amounts or practices could cause our revenues to decline and we may not be able to offset reduced operating margins through cost reductions  increased volume or otherwise 
military healthcare staffing we are a provider of healthcare professionals serving patients eligible to receive care in military treatment facilities nationwide administered by the us department of defense and beneficiaries of other government agencies in their respective clinical locations 
our revenues derived from military and government facility healthcare staffing totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues are generated from contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process which primarily takes place during the third quarter of each year 
a portion of the contracts awarded during the third quarter of expired during and were subject to a competitive rebidding and award process 
we were successful in retaining existing business or winning new bids following completion of the bidding process as of october   in the estimated annualized amount of million 
the estimated annualized amount of million included million awarded under one year contracts 
in addition  the process of awarding military and government facility healthcare staffing contracts has shifted in recent years toward an increased bias to award certain contracts to qualified small and minority owned businesses 
although we participate in such small and minority owned business awards to the extent we can serve as a sub contractor  our revenues from these arrangements are limited compared to an outright contract award  which has been a large contributing factor in the financial performance decline of the military staffing division 
approximately and of our military staffing revenue for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  was derived through subcontracting agreements with small business prime contractors 
in december  our military staffing division was directed by the army medical command to proceed with a contract originally awarded in and subsequently re awarded in june for completing the construction of and providing clinical staffing and management services for two new family health centers fhcs in northern virginia 
upon completion of the clinic construction and commencement of clinical staffing and management services which is expected to be on or before june   annual revenues under the contract are estimated to be approximately million 
radiology operations during the fourth quarter of  the company completed a strategic review of its radiology operations  including past performance and future growth opportunities and based upon the review  concluded that the existing business model of providing teleradiology and radiology staffing services was not a viable long term strategy and could not consistently meet internal growth targets 
as a result of this review  the company made a decision to exit this non core business line 
this process was essentially completed during the first quarter of with the sale of the teleradiology business 
for the years ended december   and  the radiology division generated approximately million  million and million of net revenue less provision  respectively 
other than the incurrence of operating costs during the wind down period  we do not currently anticipate any additional significant charges to be realized 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenue 
net revenue consists of fee for service revenue  contract revenue and other revenue 
net revenue is recorded in the period services are rendered 
our net revenue is principally derived from the provision of healthcare staffing services to patients within healthcare facilities 
the form of billing and related risk of collection for such services may vary by customer 
the following is a summary of the principal forms of our billing arrangements and how net revenue is recognized for each 
a significant portion approximately of our net revenue in the year ended december  and for the year ended december  resulted from fee for service patient visits 
fee for service revenue represents revenue earned under contracts in which we bill and collect the professional component of charges for medical services rendered by our contracted and employed physicians 
under the fee for service arrangements  we bill patients for services provided and receive payment from patients or their third party payers 
fee for service revenue is reported net of contractual allowances and policy discounts 
all services provided are expected to result in cash flows and are therefore reflected as net revenue in the financial statements 
fee for service revenue is recognized in the period that the services are rendered to specific patients and reduced immediately for the estimated impact of contractual allowances in the case of those patients having third party payer coverage 
the recognition of net revenue gross charges less contractual allowances from such visits is dependent on such factors as proper completion of medical charts following a patient visit  the forwarding of such charts to one of our billing centers for medical coding and entering into our billing systems and the verification of each patient s submission or representation at the time services are rendered as to the payer s responsible for payment of such services 
net revenue is recorded based on the information known at the time of entering such information into our billing systems as well as an estimate of the net revenue associated with medical charts for a given service period that have not yet been processed into our billing systems 
the above factors and estimates are subject to change 
for example  patient payer information may change following an initial attempt to bill for services due to a change in payer status 
such changes in payer status have an impact on recorded net revenue due to differing payers being subject to different contractual allowance amounts 
such changes in net revenue are recognized in the period that such changes in the payer become known 
similarly  the actual volume of medical charts not processed into our billing systems may be different from the amounts estimated 
such differences in net revenue are adjusted the following month based on actual chart volumes processed 
contract revenue represents revenue generated under contracts in which we provide physician and other healthcare staffing and administrative services in return for a contractually negotiated fee 
contract revenue consists primarily of billings based on hours of healthcare staffing provided at agreed upon hourly rates 
revenue in such cases is recognized as the hours worked by our staff and contractors 
additionally  contract revenue includes supplemental revenue from hospitals where we may have a fee for service contract arrangement 
contract revenue for the supplemental billing in such cases is recognized based on the terms of each individual contract 
such contract terms generally either provide for a fixed monthly dollar amount or a variable amount based upon measurable monthly activity  such as hours staffed  patient visits or collections per visit compared to a minimum activity threshold 
such supplemental revenues based on variable arrangements are usually contractually fixed on a monthly  quarterly or annual calculation basis considering the variable factors negotiated 
table of contents in each such arrangement 
such supplemental revenues are recognized as revenue in the period when such amounts are determined to be fixed and therefore contractually obligated as payable by the customer under the terms of the respective agreement 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue from management and billing services provided to outside parties 
revenue is recognized for such services pursuant to the terms of the contracts with customers 
generally  such contracts consist of fixed monthly amounts with revenue recognized in the month services are rendered or as hourly consulting fees recognized as revenue as hours worked in accordance with such arrangements 
additionally  we derive a portion of our revenues from providing billing services that are contingent upon the collection of third party physician billings by us on behalf of such customers 
revenues are not considered earned and therefore not recognized as revenue until actual cash collections are achieved in accordance with the contractual arrangements for such services 
net revenue less provision for uncollectibles 
net revenue less provision for uncollectibles reflects management s estimate of billed amounts to ultimately be collected 
management  in estimating the amounts to be collected resulting from over nine million annual fee for service patient visits and procedures  considers such factors as prior contract collection experience  current period changes in payer mix and patient acuity indicators  reimbursement rate trends in governmental and private sector insurance programs  resolution of overprovision account balances  the estimated impact of billing system effectiveness improvement initiatives  and trends in collections from self pay patients and external collection agencies 
in developing our estimate of collections per visit or procedure  we consider the amount of outstanding gross accounts receivable by period of service  but do not use an accounts receivable aging schedule to establish estimated collection valuations 
individual estimates of net revenue less provision by contractual location are monitored and refreshed each month as cash receipts are applied to existing accounts receivable and other current trends that have an impact upon the estimated collections per visit are observed 
such estimates are substantially formulaic in nature 
in the ordinary course of business we experience changes in our initial estimates of net revenues less provision for uncollectibles during the year following commencement of services 
such provisions and any subsequent changes in estimates may result in adjustments to our operating results with a corresponding adjustment to our accounts receivable allowance for uncollectibles on our balance sheet 
differences between amounts ultimately realized and the initial estimates of net revenue less provision have historically not been material 
net revenue less provision for uncollectibles for the years ended december   and  respectively  consisted of the following in thousands gross fee for service charges unbilled revenue less contractual adjustments fee for service revenue contract revenue other revenue net revenue less provision for uncollectibles net revenue less provision for uncollectibles contractual adjustments represent our estimate of discounts and other adjustments to be recognized from gross fee for service charges under contractual payment arrangements  primarily with commercial  managed care and governmental payment plans such as medicare and medicaid when affiliated providers participate in such plans 
the increase in contractual adjustments noted above is due to the overall increase in gross fee for service charges resulting from annual increases in our gross billing fee schedules and increases in patient visits and 
table of contents procedures between periods 
contractual adjustments increased at a faster pace than the increase in gross fee for service charges as the annual reimbursement increases under contracts with managed care plans and government payers that are subject to contractual adjustments tend to be less than the overall annual increase in our gross billing fee schedules 
the table below summarizes our approximate payer mix as a percentage of fee for service patient volume for the periods indicated year ended december  payer medicare medicaid commercial and managed care self pay other total accounts receivable 
as described above and below  we determine the estimated value of our accounts receivable based on estimated cash collection run rates of estimated future collections  by facility contract  for patient visits under our fee for service contract revenue 
accordingly  we are unable to report the payer mix composition on a dollar basis of our outstanding net accounts receivable 
however  a change in the estimated carrying value of our net fee for service patient accounts receivable before consideration of the allowance for uncollectible accounts at december  could have an after tax effect of approximately million on our financial position and results of operations 
our days of revenue outstanding at december  and at december   were days and days  respectively 
the number of days outstanding will fluctuate over time due to a number of factors 
the increase in average days outstanding of approximately days includes an increase of days related to the increase in estimated value of fee for service accounts receivable and an increase of days associated with an increase in estimated value of contract accounts receivable 
also contributing to the days increase is days associated with recent acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of days resulting from an increase in average revenue per day 
the increase in average revenue per day is primarily attributable to an increase in gross charges  increased pricing with managed care plans and increases in average patient acuity 
the increase of days associated with the increase of contract accounts receivable and the increase of days related to fee for service accounts receivable are due primarily to timing of cash collections and valuation adjustments recorded in the period as well as an increase in net revenue from new start up contracts in our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million as of december  approximately of our allowance for doubtful accounts is related to gross fees for fee for service patient visits 
our principal exposure for uncollectible fee for service visits is centered in self pay patients and  to a lesser extent  for co payments and deductibles from patients with insurance 
while we do not specifically allocate the allowance for doubtful accounts to individual accounts or specific payer classifications  the portion of the allowance associated with fee for service charges as of december  was equal to approximately of outstanding self pay fee for service patient accounts 
the majority of our fee for service patient visits are for the provision of emergency care in hospital settings 
due to federal government regulations governing the provision of such care  we are obligated to provide emergency care regardless of the patient s ability to pay or whether or not the patient has insurance or other third party coverage for the costs of the services rendered 
while we attempt to obtain all relevant billing information at the time emergency care services are rendered  there are numerous patient encounters where such information is not available at time of discharge 
in such cases where detailed billing information relative to 
table of contents insurance or other third party coverage is not available at discharge  we attempt to obtain such information from the patient or client hospital billing record information subsequent to discharge to facilitate the collections process 
collections at the time of rendering such services emergency room discharge are not significant 
primary responsibility for collection of fee for service accounts receivable resides within our internal billing operations 
once a claim has been submitted to a payer or an individual patient  employees within our billing operations are responsible for the follow up collection efforts 
the protocol for follow up differs by payer classification 
for self pay patients  our billing system will automatically send a series of dunning letters on a prescribed time frame requesting payment or the provision of information reflecting that the balance due is covered by another payer  such as medicare or a third party insurance plan 
generally  the dunning cycle on a self pay account will run from to days 
at the end of this period  if no collections or additional information is obtained from the patient  the account is no longer considered an active account and is transferred to a collection agency 
upon transfer to a collection agency  the patient account is written off as a bad debt 
any subsequent cash receipts on accounts previously written off are recorded as a recovery 
for non self pay accounts  billing personnel will follow up and respond to any communication from payers such as requests for additional information or denials until collection of the account is obtained or other resolution has occurred 
at the completion of our collection cycle  selected accounts may be transferred to collection agencies under a contingent collection basis 
the projected value of future contingent collection proceeds expected to be collected over a multi year period are considered in the estimation of our overall accounts receivable valuation 
for contract accounts receivable  invoices for services are prepared in our various operating areas and mailed to our customers  generally on a monthly basis 
contract terms under such arrangements generally require payment within days of receipt of the invoice 
outstanding invoices are periodically reviewed and operations personnel with responsibility for the customer relationship will contact the customer to follow up on any delinquent invoices 
contract accounts receivable will be considered as bad debt and written off based upon the individual circumstances of the customer situation after all collection efforts have been exhausted  including legal action if warranted  and it is the judgment of management that the account is not expected to be collected 
methodology for computing allowance for doubtful accounts 
we employ several methodologies for determining our allowance for doubtful accounts depending on the nature of the net revenue recognized 
we initially determine gross revenue for our fee for service patient visits based upon established fee schedule prices 
such gross revenue is reduced for estimated contractual allowances for those patient visits covered by contractual insurance arrangements to result in net revenue 
net revenue is then reduced for our estimate of uncollectible amounts 
fee for service net revenue less provision for uncollectibles represents our estimated cash to be collected from such patient visits and is net of our estimate of account balances estimated to be uncollectible 
the provision for uncollectible fee for service patient visits is based on historical experience resulting from over nine million annual fee for service patient visits 
the significant volume of patient visits and the terms of thousands of commercial and managed care contracts and the various reimbursement policies relating to governmental healthcare programs do not make it feasible to evaluate fee for service accounts receivable on a specific account basis 
fee for service accounts receivable collection estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for each of our fee for service contracts by period of accounts receivable origination 
such reviews include the use of historical cash collection percentages by contract adjusted for the lapse of time since the date of the patient visit 
in addition  when actual collection percentages differ from expected results  on a contract by contract basis  supplemental detailed reviews of the outstanding accounts receivable balances may be performed by our billing operations to determine whether there are facts and circumstances existing that may cause a different conclusion as to the estimate of the collectibility of that contract s accounts receivable from the estimate resulting from using the historical collection experience 
contract related net revenue is billed based on the terms of the contract at amounts expected to be collected 
such billings are typically submitted on a monthly basis and aged trial balances prepared 
allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts related to such contract billings are made based upon specific accounts and invoice periodic reviews once it is concluded that such amounts are not likely to be collected 
the methodologies employed to compute allowances for doubtful accounts were unchanged between and 
table of contents insurance reserves the nature of our business is such that it is subject to professional liability claims and lawsuits 
historically  to mitigate a portion of this risk  we have maintained insurance for individual professional liability claims with per incident and annual aggregate limits per physician for all incidents 
prior to march   we obtained such insurance coverage from commercial insurance providers 
subsequent to march   we have provided for a significant portion of our professional liability loss exposures through the use of a captive insurance company and through greater utilization of self insurance reserves 
since march   the most significant cost element within our professional liability program has consisted of the actuarial estimates of losses by occurrence period 
in addition to the estimated actuarial losses  other costs that are considered by management in the estimation of professional liability costs include program costs such as brokerage fees  claims management expenses  program premiums and taxes  and other administrative costs of operating the program  such as the costs to operate the captive insurance subsidiary 
net costs in any period reflect our estimate of net losses to be incurred in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserves established for net losses of prior periods 
our commercial insurance policy for professional liability losses for the period march  through march  included insured limits applicable to such coverage in the period 
effective april  we executed an agreement with the commercial insurance provider that issued the policy that ended march  to increase the existing million aggregate limit of coverage 
under the terms of the agreement  we will make periodic premium payments to the commercial insurance company and the total aggregate limit of coverage under the policy will be increased by a portion of the premiums paid 
we have committed to fund premiums such that the total aggregate limit of coverage under the program remains greater than the paid losses at any point in time 
during fiscal years and  we funded a total of million and million under this agreement 
for the year ended december   we funded a total of million and have agreed to fund additional payments  which will be based upon the level of incurred losses relative to the aggregate limit of coverage at that time 
as of december   the current aggregate limit of coverage under this policy was million and the estimated loss reserve for claim losses and expenses in excess of the current aggregate limit was million 
the accounts of the captive insurance company are fully consolidated with those of our other operations in the accompanying financial statements 
the estimation of medical professional liability losses is inherently complex 
medical professional liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often as long as ten years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
a report of actuarial loss estimates is prepared at least semi annually 
management s estimate of our professional liability costs resulting from such actuarial studies is significantly influenced by assumptions and assessments regarding expectations of several factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to historical paid and incurred loss development trends  hours of exposure as measured by hours of physician and related professional staff services  trends in the frequency and severity of claims  which can differ significantly by jurisdiction due to the legislative and judicial climate in such jurisdictions  coverage limits of third party insurance  the effectiveness of our claims management process  and the outcome of litigation 
as a result of the variety of factors that must be considered by management  there is a risk that actual incurred losses may develop differently from estimates 
the underlying information that serves as the foundational basis for making our actuarial estimates of professional liability losses is our internal database of incurred professional liability losses 
we have captured extensive professional liability loss data going back  in some cases  over twenty years  that is maintained and updated on an ongoing basis by our internal claims management personnel 
our database contains comprehensive 
table of contents incurred loss information for our existing operations as far back as fiscal year reflecting the initial timeframe in which we migrated to a consolidated professional liability program concurrent with the consummation of several significant acquisitions and  in addition  we possess additional loss data that predates dates of occurrence for certain of our operations 
loss information reflects both paid and reserved losses incurred when we were covered by outside commercial insurance programs as well as paid and reserved losses incurred under our self insurance program 
because of the comprehensive nature of the loss data and our comfort with the completeness and reliability of the loss data  this is the information that is used in the development of our actuarial loss estimates 
we believe this database is one of the largest repositories of physician professional liability loss information available in our industry and provides us and our actuarial consultants with sufficient data to develop reasonable estimates of the ultimate losses under our self insurance program 
in addition to the estimated losses  as part of the actuarial process  we obtain revised payment pattern assumptions that are based upon our historical loss and related claims payment experience 
such payment patterns reflect estimated cash outflows for aggregate incurred losses by period based upon the occurrence date of the loss as well as the report date of the loss 
although variances have been observed in the actuarial estimate of ultimate losses by occurrence period between actuarial studies  the estimated payment patterns have shown much more limited variability 
we use these payment patterns to develop our estimate of the discounted reserve amounts 
the relative consistency of the payment pattern estimates provides us with a foundation in which to develop a reasonable estimate of the discount value of the professional liability reserves based upon the most current estimate of ultimate losses to be paid and the reasonable likelihood of the related cash flows over the payment period 
as of december  and december   our estimated loss reserves were discounted at and  respectively  which was the current ten year us treasury rate at those dates  and which reflects the risk free interest rate over the expected period of claims payments 
in establishing our initial reserves for a given loss period  management considers the results of the actuarial loss estimates for such periods as well as assumptions regarding loss retention levels and other program costs to be incurred 
on a semi annual basis  we will review our professional liability reserves considering not only the reserves and loss estimates associated with the current period  but also the reserves established in prior periods based upon revised actuarial loss estimates 
the actuarial estimation process employed utilizes a frequency severity simulation model to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for each loss period 
the results of the simulation model are then validated by a comparison to the results from several different actuarial methods paid loss development  incurred loss development  incurred bornhuetter ferguson method  paid bornhuetter ferguson method for reasonableness 
each method contains assumptions regarding the underlying claims process 
actuarial loss estimates at various confidence levels capture the variability in the loss estimates for process risk but assume that the underlying model and assumptions are correct 
adjustments to professional liability loss reserves will be made as needed to reflect revised assumptions and emerging trends and data 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for professional liability losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates can have a material effect on the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
given the number of factors considered in establishing the reserves for professional liability losses  it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 
the actuarial reports provide a variety of loss estimates based upon statistical confidence levels reflecting the inherent uncertainty of the medical professional liability claims environment in which we operate 
initial year loss estimates are generally recorded using the actuarial expected loss estimate  but aggregate professional liability loss reserves may be carried at amounts in excess of the expected loss estimates provided by the actuarial reports due to the relatively short time period in which we have provided for our losses on a self insured basis and the expectation that we believe additional adjustments to prior year estimates may occur as our reporting history and loss portfolio matures 
in addition  we are subject to the risk of claims in excess of insured limits as well as unlimited aggregate risk of loss in certain loss periods 
as our self insurance program continues to mature and additional stability is noted in the loss development trends in the initial years of the program  we expect to continue to review and evaluate the carried level of reserves and make adjustments as needed 

table of contents based on the results of the actuarial study completed in april  management determined no additional change was necessary in our consolidated reserves for professional liability losses during the first quarter of related to prior year loss estimates 
the second semi annual actuarial study was completed in october based on these results  in the third quarter of we recorded an increase in professional liability reserves associated with prior year loss estimates in the amount of million in response to a revaluation of the discounted carrying value of the prior year professional liability reserves due to the decline in the interest rate environment during of the total reserve increase  approximately million was associated with loss estimates established in prior years for the self insurance program covering the loss occurrence periods from march  through december  the remaining reserve increase of million was associated with the estimated losses in excess of the aggregate limit of coverage under the commercial insurance program that ended march  the following reflects the current reserves for professional liability costs as of december  in millions as well as the sensitivity of the reserve estimates at a and confidence level as reported at confidence level at confidence level it is not possible to quantify the amount of the change in our estimate of prior year losses by individual fiscal period due to the nature of the professional liability loss estimates that are provided to us on an occurrence period basis and the nature of the coverage that is obtained in the commercial insurance market which is generally underwritten on a claims made or report period basis 
even though we are self insured for a significant portion of our risk  due to customer contracting requirements and state insurance regulations  we still  at times  must place coverage on a claims made or report period basis with commercial insurance carriers 
when evaluating the appropriate carrying level of our self insured professional liability reserves  management considers the current estimates of occurrence period loss estimates as well as how such loss estimates and related future claims will interact with previous or current commercial insurance programs when projecting future cash flows 
however  the complexity that is associated with multiple occurrence periods interacting with multiple report periods that contain risks and related reserves retained by us  as well as transferred to commercial insurance carriers  makes it impossible to allocate the change in prior year loss estimates to individual occurrence periods 
instead  we evaluate the future expected cash flows for all historical loss periods in the aggregate and compare such estimates to the current carrying value of our professional liability reserves 
this process provides the basis for us to conclude that our reserves for professional liability losses are reasonable and properly stated 
management considers the results of actuarial studies when estimating the appropriate level of professional liability reserves and no adjustments to prior year loss estimates were made in periods where updated actuarial loss estimates were not available 
the april and october actuarial reports did not reflect a significant change  at various confidence levels  in the estimated ultimate undiscounted losses by occurrence period for the self insured loss period from march  through december  or our exposure in excess of the aggregate limit of coverage in place on the commercial insurance program that ended march  and the adjustment to the carrying value of our reserves in the third quarter of was due primarily to a decline in the discount rate 
due to the complexity of the actuarial estimation process  there are many factors  trends  and assumptions that must be considered in the development of the actuarial loss estimates and we are not able to quantify and disclose which specific elements are primarily contributing to the overall favorable development in the revised loss estimates of historical occurrence periods 
however  we believe that our internal investments in enhanced risk management and claims management resources and initiatives  such as the employment of additional claims and litigation management personnel and practices and an expansion of programs such as root cause loss analysis  early claim evaluation  and litigation support for insured providers  as well as the improved legal environment resulting from professional liability tort reform efforts in certain key jurisdictions such as florida and texas have contributed to the favorable trend in loss development estimates noted during the prior year occurrence periods 

table of contents impairment of intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
specifically  in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on the historical and expected future performance of the specific reporting units and the current valuation multiples of entities that have comparable operations and economic characteristics 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in december we recognized a non tax deductible charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with our military staffing division 
following the charge there is approximately million of remaining goodwill associated with this division 
the decline in carrying value and resulting goodwill impairment charge resulted from our annual impairment test results and reflects the decline in the military s financial performance and the impact of the more challenging government contracting environment 
also in june  we recorded an impairment loss of million associated with a contractual relationship acquired in prior years whose expected term was less than initially estimated 
the remaining reporting units that have recorded goodwill  based on the results of our annual impairment test  are not considered to be at risk as of december  the results of step one of the annual impairment test completed as of december   and as prescribed by the provisions of asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  which is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill  indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit that has remaining recorded goodwill exceeded its carrying value by more than

as of december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
there are no known liquidity restrictions or impairments on our cash and cash equivalents as of december  our ongoing cash needs for the year ended december  were substantially met from internally generated operating sources and our revolving credit facility 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the corresponding period in included in cash provided by operations were contingent purchase price payments of million in and million in excluding the impact of contingent purchase price payments  the million increase in operating cash flow was principally the result of improved profitability  absence of cash costs associated with the bond redemption in and reduced interest payments in  offset by an increase in accounts receivable funding and tax payments between years 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the same period of the million increase in cash used in investing activities was principally due to an increase in cash payments related to acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was million compared to cash used in financing of million in the year ended december  the change in cash associated with financing activities was due to million in net proceeds from the revolving credit facility and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options in compared to the million payments made in connection with our senior subordinated notes  partially offset by the million of fees and expenses paid in connection with our refinancing  million increase in net term debt payments  and the million of net proceeds received in in connection with the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option relating to our initial public offering 
we spent million in and million in for capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for billing and information technology investments and related development projects along with projects in support of operational initiatives 
on june   we completed the financing of new senior credit facilities  consisting of a million five year revolving credit facility  a million five year term a loan facility and a million seven year term b loan facility  with a syndicate of financial institutions 
we used borrowings under the new credit facilities and existing cash to repay the outstanding balance of million under the term loan as well as million of fees and expenses associated with the refinancing 
in december  under the provisions of the accordion feature of our new senior credit agreement  we increased the amount of our revolving credit facility to million 
the terms of the revolving credit facility  including pricing and maturity did not change 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these new borrowings  we expect our effective interest rate going forward to be higher compared to the rate under our previous debt structure 
as of december   we had million in aggregate indebtedness consisting of our term loans and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility with an additional million of borrowing capacity available under our senior secured revolving credit facility without giving effect to million of undrawn letters of credit 
under our new senior credit facility  outstanding term a loan borrowings mature on june  and term b loan borrowings mature on june  our new senior credit facility agreement contains both affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell material assets  retire  redeem or otherwise reacquire our capital stock  acquire the capital stock or assets of another business and pay dividends  and require us to comply with a maximum first lien net leverage ratio  tested quarterly 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the new senior credit facility agreement 
the new senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our and our us subsidiaries assets 
as of december   we were a party to three separate forward interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements expired in the first quarter of the change in value during the year ended december  of approximately million  net of tax  was recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings 
subject to any contractual restrictions  we and our subsidiaries  affiliates or significant stockholders including the sponsor and its affiliates may from time to time  in their sole discretion  purchase  repay  redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt or equity securities including any publicly issued debt or equity securities  in privately negotiated or open market transactions  by tender offer or otherwise 

table of contents we have historically been an acquirer of other physician staffing businesses and related interests 
during  total cash used related to acquisitions totaled million consisting of million for the acquisitions of certain assets and related business operations of three emergency medical staffing groups and an anesthesia staffing business that was reported in investing cash flows and million of contingent payments related to prior year acquisitions that were reported in operating cash flows 
for the year ended december   total cash used in acquisitions was million  which consisted of million of payments related to three emergency medical staffing groups that were reported in investing cash flows and million of contingent payments on prior year acquisitions reported as operating cash flow 
during  we acquired the operations of an anesthesiology staffing company  two emergency medicine medical practices and a locums tenens company for a total of million in cash reported in investing cash flows 
no contingent payments were made during generally our acquisitions contain a contingent payment provision that is based on the achievement of certain financial targets 
we currently estimate future contingent payment obligations to be approximately million based upon current projections of financial performance of the acquired operations 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a discussion of our acquisitions and contingent payment obligations 
we are currently in discussions with certain physician staffing businesses regarding potential acquisition opportunities 
if we consummate any of these potential acquisitions  we would expect to fund such acquisitions using our existing cash  or borrowings under our revolving credit facility  or the issuance of new debt or equity 
effective march   we began providing for professional liability risks in part through a captive insurance company 
prior to such date we insured such risks principally through the commercial insurance market 
the change in the professional liability insurance program initially resulted in increased cash flow due to the retention of cash formerly paid out in the form of insurance premiums to a commercial insurance company coupled with a long period typically years or longer on average before cash payout of such losses occurs 
a portion of such cash retained is retained within our captive insurance company and invested and therefore not immediately available for general corporate purposes 
as of december   the current value of cash or cash equivalents and related investments held within the captive insurance company totaled million 
investments of captive insurance are carried at fair market value and as of december   reflected million of net unrealized gains 
effective june   we renewed our fronting carrier program with a commercial insurance carrier through may  in connection with this renewal  we have paid cash premiums of million to the commercial insurance carrier 
we also funded approximately million of premiums to the captive subsidiary during for the year ended december   we also funded a total of million to a commercial insurance provider in order to meet our obligation for incurred costs in excess of the aggregate limits of coverage in place on the commercial insurance policy that ended march  we will fund additional payments which will be based upon the level of incurred losses relative to the aggregate limit of the coverage at that time as additional claims are processed

table of contents amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years after years total dollars in thousands other commitments standby letters of credit contingent purchase payments subtotal total obligations and commitments we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as further adjusted to exclude the non cash items and the other adjustments shown in the table below 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles 
in evaluating our performance as measured by adjusted ebitda  management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measure 
adjusted ebitda does not reflect certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
in addition  other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate it at all  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted ebitda

inflation we do not believe that general inflation in the us economy has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
seasonality historically  our revenues and operating results have reflected minimal seasonal variation due to the significance of revenues derived from patient visits to eds  which are generally open on a day basis  and also due to our geographic diversification 
however  the timing  severity  and geographical impact of influenza activity within the united states will generally impact fee for service visits and related net revenue 
revenue from our non ed staffing lines is dependent on a healthcare facility being open during selected time periods 
revenue in such instances will fluctuate depending upon such factors as the number of holidays in the period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities 
interest rate swap agreements have been used to manage a portion of our interest rate exposure  however  no swap agreements are currently in effect as of december  at december   the fair value of our total debt  which had a carrying value of million  was million 
at december   the fair value of our total debt  which had a carrying value of million  was million 
we had million of variable debt outstanding at december  and million outstanding at december  if the market interest rates for our variable rate borrowings had averaged more subsequent to december  and  our interest expense excluding the impact of our interest rate swap agreements would have increased  and earnings before income taxes would have decreased  by approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  and this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management could take actions in an attempt to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
