item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following review of the trust s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
the discussion of net production attributable to the hugoton and san juan properties represents production volumes that are to a large extent hypothetical as the trust does not own and is not entitled to any specific production volumes 
critical accounting policies the financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis a royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by the working interest owners to the trustee for such month rather than either the value of a portion of the oil and gas produced by the working interest owners for such month or the amount subsequently determined to be the trust s proportionate share of the net proceeds for such month  b interest income  interest receivable and distributions payable to unitholders include interest to be earned on short term investments from the financial statement date through the next date of distribution  c trust general and administrative expenses  net of reimbursements  are recorded in the month they are included in the calculation of the monthly distribution amount  d amortization of the royalty is computed on a unit of production basis and is charged directly to trust corpus since such amount does not affect distributable income  and 
table of contents e distributions payable are determined on a monthly basis and are payable to unitholders of record as of the last business day of each month or such later date as the trustee determines is required to comply with applicable law or stock exchange requirements 
this basis for reporting distributable income is considered to be the most meaningful because distributions to the unitholders for a month are based on net cash receipts for such month 
however  these statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because  under such principles  royalty income for a month would be based on net proceeds from production for such month without regard to when calculated or received  general and administrative expenses would be recorded in the month they accrue  and interest income for a month would be calculated only through the end of such month 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed under business description of the trust in item of this form k  the trust s source of cash is the royalty income received from its share of the net proceeds from the royalty properties 
reference is made to the notes to financial statements under item of this form k for estimates of future royalty income attributable to the royalty 
in accordance with the provisions of the conveyance  generally all revenues received by the trust  net of trust administrative expenses and the amount of established reserves  are distributed currently to the unitholders 
the trustee has engaged an independent consulting firm to audit revenues  expenses and established reserves of certain working interest owners 
these reviews and audits are ongoing 
while these audits have highlighted issues that remain open  the trustee has not made a determination at this time whether any audit exceptions will result in any material gains or expenses net to the trust 
effective january   the trustee began withholding  of cash per month for future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses in accordance with the trust indenture 
the cash withholding was established through the withholding of cash received during of approximately  per monthly distribution amount  or up to  per quarter  until the cash withholding reached million 
at december   the trust has withheld a total of million which is included in cash and short term investments 
the effect on distributable income per unit is as follows twelve months ended december  distributable income before reserve for contingent liabilities and expenses reserve for contingent liabilities and expenses distributable income available for distribution distributable income per unit units outstanding

as a result of excess production costs incurred in one monthly operating period and then recovered in a subsequent monthly operating period s  the royalty income paid to the trust may not agree to the trust s royalty interest in the net proceeds 
excess production costs related to the san juan basin colorado properties operated by bp were approximately  as of december  the excess production costs must be recovered by the working interest owners before any distribution of royalty income will be made to the trust 
average production costs attributable to the royalty are calculated as stated capital costs plus operating costs  divided by stated net production volumes attributable to the royalty paid 
as noted above in footnote  production costs may be incurred in one operating period and then recovered in a subsequent operating period  which may cause royalty income paid to the trust not to agree to the trust s royalty interest in the net proceeds 
net production volumes attributable to the royalty are determined by dividing royalty income by the average sales price received 
due to an adjustment of  to royalty income at december   the natural gas royalty income and oil  condensate and natural gas liquids royalty income may not agree to the twelve months ended december  royalty income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust does not engage in any operations  and does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments  either for trading purposes or for other than trading purposes 
the trust s monthly distributions are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of natural gas 
natural gas prices can fluctuate widely on a month to month basis in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the trust and the working interest owners 
factors that contribute to price fluctuation include  among others political conditions worldwide  in particular political disruption  war or other armed conflict in or affecting oil producing regions  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms in the gulf of mexico  the supply and price of foreign natural gas  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the proximity to  and capacity of  transportation facilities  and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures 
moreover  government regulations  such as regulation of natural gas transportation  regulation of greenhouse gas and other emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion  and price controls  can affect product prices in the long term
