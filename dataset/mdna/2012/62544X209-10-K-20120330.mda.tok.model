in  the company intends to focus on maintaining profitability in its fs business segment 
with regards to its mdu business segment  the company believes it can aggressively grow owned subscriber revenues by acquiring new rights of entry agreements  increasing marketing and customer penetrations of previously built out properties and by acquiring existing subscribers from other operators 
in addition  the company believes it can increase managed subscriber revenues by selling its support center services to its network of system operators and by providing ancillary programs for voice and data services to that same network 
in the ee c segment  the company expects to see improvements in operating results as i a concentrated focus on the selling process results in increased bid activity which should result in increased revenues  ii governmental grants for alternate energy projects are extended to promote growth in wind projects  and iii g to g tower conversions increase based on the demand for higher capacity mobile infrastructure 
management anticipates that the impact of the actions listed below will generate sufficient cash flows to pay current liabilities  long term debt and capital and operating lease obligations and fund the company s operations for the next twelve months maintain continued profitability in the company s fs segment 
evaluate factors such as anticipated usage and inventory turnover to maintain optimal inventory levels 
obtain senior debt financing with extended terms to refinance the company s note payable to directech holding company  inc  which matures on january  expand call center support with sales of call center services to both existing and future system operators 
solicit additional equity investment in the company by issuing either preferred or common stock for general corporate purposes 
improve profitability in newly diversified business segments 
the company  as of december   needs to continue to improve its working capital ratio over the next few quarters to adequately manage the size of its expanded operations 
since the company acquired significant assets in its purchase of of the outstanding stock of the former dthc operating entities  multiband believes it has the capacity to leverage certain of those assets 
management believes that through a combination of leveraging assets  its cash on hand  greater expense control  recent positive operating income  and potential sales of common and or preferred stock  it can meet its anticipated liquidity and capital resource requirements for the next twelve months 
as of december   we had a backlog of unfilled orders of approximately  compared to approximately million at december  the company s acquisition of se and mw in september  accounted for all of this increase 
we define backlog as the value of work in hand to be provided for customers as of a specific date where the following conditions are met with the exception of engineering change orders i the price of the work to be done is fixed  ii the scope of the work to be done is fixed  both in definition and amount  and iii there is an executed written contract  purchase order  agreement or other documentary evidence which represents a firm commitment by the customer to pay us for the work to be performed 
these backlog amounts are based on contract values and purchase orders and may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all 
we have experienced variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from external market factors and economic factors beyond our control and we may experience such delays or cancellations in the future 
backlog does not include new firm commitments which may be awarded to us by our customers from time to time in future periods 
these new project awards could be started and completed in this same future period 
accordingly  our backlog does not necessarily represent the total revenue that could be earned by us in future periods 
critical accounting policies inventories the company s inventories are segregated into three major categories 
serialized directv inventories consist primarily of satellite receivers and similar devices 
non serialized directv inventories consist primarily of satellite dishes  poles and similar devices which are supplied by directv 
other inventory consists primarily of cable  switches and various small parts used in the installation of directv satellite dishes 
inventory is priced using a standard cost  which approximates actual costs  determined on a first in first out basis 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  equipment  leasehold improvements  which are subject to depreciation and intangibles  which are subject to amortization 
at december   the company had net property and equipment of  which represents approximately of the company s total assets 
at december   the company had net intangibles of  which represented approximately of the company s total assets see note 
the company annually reviews its long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable or exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is incurred 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
for the fs and ee c segments  the income approach was used to measure fair value for those long lived assets 
the income approach was based on the present value of five years of discounted cash flows 
for the mdu segment  the market approach was used which included considering market values from comparable transactions to measure fair value of those long lived assets 
comparable transactions were identified based on their similarities to the reporting unit with similar features including the age of equipment and length of roe contracts 
in  the company recorded impairment charges of  in the mdu segment related to two partially completed projects 
the owners of the mdu properties are in financial distress and the build outs may never be completed 
the company estimated that the full value of the work in process as of december  may not be recognized and so an impairment charge was recorded against the value of the work in process 
in  the company did not record any impairment to long lived assets related to the fs segment 
the ee c segment did not exist in there was no impairment recorded for any of the segments at december  impairment of goodwill in accordance with accounting standards code asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and intangible assets without a defined life shall not be amortized over a defined period  but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step impairment test 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company s estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business models  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect the company s future financial results 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the activities in the second step include valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the impaired reporting unit based on their fair value and determining the fair value of the impaired reporting unit s goodwill based upon the residual of the summed identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses  which amounts to  as of december   may be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an impairment charge of on the goodwill related to the subsidiary  security  because in november  the contract to install home security systems was terminated with a third party 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an impairment charge of on the goodwill related to the us install purchase 
during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment related to goodwill 
group health and workers compensation insurance coverage the company uses a combination of self insurance and third party carrier insurance with predetermined deductibles that cover certain insurable risks 
the company records liabilities for claims reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported  based on historical experience and industry data 
insurance and claims accruals reflect the estimated cost for group health and workers compensation claims not covered by insurance 
the insurance and claims accruals are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts 
such insurance and claims accruals are based upon individual case estimates and estimates of incurred but not reported losses using loss development factors based upon past experience and industry data 
during  the company was self insured in most states for workers compensation claims up to plus administrative expenses  for each occurrence 
during  the company was self insured for workers compensation claims up to plus administrative expenses  for each occurrence 
during  in certain states  the company was self insured for workers compensation liability claims up to  plus administrative expenses  for each occurrence since february  the company is self insured for health insurance covering the range of liability up to per claim 
if any liability claims are substantially in excess of coverage amounts  such claims are covered under premium based policies issued by insurance companies to coverage levels that management considers adequate 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock options using fair value for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors 
the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the company s expected stock price volatility  and actual and projected stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
income taxes the company accounts for deferred tax assets and liabilities under the liability method 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable amounts in future years 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the company considers projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies  then records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the net deferred taxes for these amounts that are more likely than not  unable to be realized 
in  the company determined it was able to release a previously established valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to non cash compensation in the amount of during  based on the company s assessment of all available evidence  including previous years income  estimates of future profitability  and the overall prospects of future business  the company determined that they would will be able to realize a portion of the deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded  of income tax benefit for the year ended december   which included a  release of the valuation allowance 
based on existing contracts  the company used a discounted projection of its revenue and expenses over a five year period which approximated the remaining life of our hsp contract with directv including the one year renewal term  to determine the level of existing net operating loss carryforwards it would be able to offset against taxable income in those periods 
the company also analyzed its other deferred tax assets and liabilities outstanding at december  a portion of the valuation allowance was removed for the amount projected to reverse 
as of december   the company believed it was more likely than not that it would be unable to fully utilize the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets was recorded as of that date 
at december  and  the valuation allowance was  and  respectively 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect these contractual obligations including interest payments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods total year or less years years over years operating leases buildings    long term debt    capital leases totals     forward looking statements from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements including those made in this document 
in order to comply with the terms of the private securities litigation reform act  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  developments and results of the company s business include the following national and regional economic conditions  pending and future legislation affecting the it and telecommunications industry  market acceptance of the company s products and services  the company s continued ability to provide integrated communication solutions for customers in a dynamic industry  the company s ability to raise additional financing and other competitive factors 
because these and other factors could affect the company s operating results  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future period results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk impact of inflation and changing prices certain components of our business can be negatively impacted by inflation such as self insured health and workers compensation claim costs  fuel expenses and professional services 
increase price levels generally due to inflationary pressures could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position
