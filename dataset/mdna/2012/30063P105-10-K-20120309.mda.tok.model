item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our financial statements and should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview exact sciences corporation is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer 
we have exclusive intellectual property protecting our non invasive  molecular screening technology for the detection of colorectal pre cancer and cancer 
our primary goal is to become the market leader for a patient friendly diagnostic screening product for the early detection of colorectal pre cancer and cancer 
our strategic roadmap to achieve this goal includes the following key components develop and refine our non invasive cologuard stool based dna sdna colorectal pre cancer and cancer screening test  advance our product through us food and drug administration fda clinical trials  and commercialize an fda cleared product that detects colorectal pre cancer and cancer 
our cologuard test includes dna markers  which in published studies have been shown to be associated with colorectal cancer 
in addition to dna markers  our test will also include a protein marker to detect blood in the stool  utilizing an antibody based fecal immunochemical test fit 
our current focus is on seeking us food and drug administration clearance or approval for our cologuard test 
we also are in the process of developing our strategy for the ultimate commercialization of our cologuard test 
we believe obtaining fda clearance or approval is critical to building broad demand and successful commercialization for our sdna colorectal cancer screening technologies 
product performance  throughput and cost are among the elements that will need to be addressed in the design and development of a commercial product based on our technology 
our cologuard test is designed to detect pre cancerous lesions or polyps  and each of the four stages of colorectal cancer 
pre cancerous polyps are present in approximately percent of average risk people years of age and older who come in for routine colorectal cancer screening 
we are designing our cologuard test with a goal of detecting both pre cancers and cancers 
the target sensitivity rate for cancer is equal to or greater than percent at a specificity of percent 
in preliminary validation studies our cologuard test was able to detect cancers at or above this target sensitivity rate and we were also able to demonstrate strong pre cancer detection 
we are in the process of developing our strategy for the ultimate commercialization of our cologuard test 
it is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable  yet least prevented cancers 
colorectal cancer typically takes up to years to progress from a pre cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death 
however  it is the second leading cause of cancer death in the united states  killing almost  people each year 
there is a significant unmet clinical need related to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer 
approximately percent of those who should be screened for colorectal cancer are not screened according to current guidelines 
poor compliance has meant that nearly two thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease s late stages 
the five year survival rates for stages and are percent and percent  respectively 

table of contents our cologuard test can detect pre cancers and cancers early  and is expected to be a powerful  preventive tool 
by detecting pre cancers and cancers early with our test  affected patients can be referred to colonoscopy  during which the polyp or lesion can be removed 
the sdna screening model has the potential to significantly reduce colorectal cancer deaths 
the earlier pre cancer or cancer is detected  the greater the reduction in mortality 
the benefits of sdna based screening are clear 
it detects both pre cancers and cancers 
sdna based screening is non invasive and requires no bowel preparation or dietary restriction like other methods 
the sample for sdna based screening can be collected easily at home and mailed to the appropriate laboratory  where the testing would be conducted 
sdna based screening also is affordable  particularly relative to colonoscopy 
the competitive landscape is favorable to sdna based screening 
all of the colorectal cancer detection methods in use today are constrained by some combination of poor sensitivity  poor compliance and cost 
colonoscopy is uncomfortable and expensive 
a study showed that seven out of people age and older who were told they should get a colonoscopy did not do so primarily due to fears 
fecal blood testing suffers from poor sensitivity  including percent detection rates for cancer and percent detection rates for pre cancers  and poor compliance 
blood based dna testing also is disadvantaged by its low sensitivity for cancer and its inability to reliably detect pre cancer 
data from a validation study of one blood based test was released in late it demonstrated only percent sensitivity across all stages of cancer at percent specificity  with little sensitivity for pre cancer 
the competitive advantages of sdna based screening provide a significant market opportunity 
assuming a percent test adoption rate and a three year screening interval  we estimate the potential us market for sdna screening to be billion 
our intellectual property portfolio positions us to be the leading player to develop and market tests for the detection of colorectal cancer from stool samples 
our portfolio of issued and pending patents broadly protects our position from competitors and yields freedom to operate in this market 
we have continued to invest in our intellectual property filings 
we have intellectual property pertaining to sample type  sample preparation  sample preservation  biomarkers  and related methods and formulations 
in  we expanded our intellectual property estate through our collaboration with the mayo clinic and licensed invader detection technology from hologic  which we plan to incorporate into our cologuard test 
we have an extensive license to markers  digital pcr  and other technologies applicable to the detection of colorectal cancer from johns hopkins university  and have additional licensed intellectual property from mdx health formerly oncomethylome sciences and case western reserve university 
we have generated limited operating revenues since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years  and it is possible we may never achieve profitability 
priorities in we will devote significant time and resources on the fda clinical trial for our cologuard test and preparing our fda submissions 
currently we expect approximately  patients to be enrolled in the trial 
our goal is to complete the clinical trial and submit the pma to the fda for the manufacturing and analytical modules by the end of if for any reason this trial is not successful or is substantially delayed  if the fda does not approve our pma or such approval is substantially delayed or for any other reason we are unable to successfully commercialize our cologuard test  our business and prospects would likely be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents with the goal of expediting receipt of a favorable coverage decision  we are working with the center for medicare and medicaid cms to coordinate our clinical trial with the cms coverage review process for our cologuard test 
we also plan to focus on manufacturing preparations and developing the market for our cologuard test during this includes working to develop an fda compliant quality management system and the capability to manufacture and ship reagents to customers as well as completing a healthcare cost effectiveness study  publishing scientific papers regarding our sdna colorectal cancer screening technologies and continuing our outreach to physicians  third party payors and advocates 
financial overview revenue our revenue is comprised of the amortization of up front license fees for the licensing of certain patent rights to labcorp and genzyme and product royalty fees on tests sold by labcorp utilizing our technology 
we expect that product royalty fees and license fees for the full year will be consistent with amounts recorded in our cost structure our selling  general and administrative expenses have consisted primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses  professional fees  sales and marketing expenses incurred in support of our commercialization efforts and  non cash stock based compensation 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  certain third party royalty obligations  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe that the following accounting policies and judgments are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition 
license fees 
license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
on june   we entered into an amendment to our exclusive license agreement with labcorp  which  among other modifications to the terms of the license  extended the exclusive license period of the license with labcorp from august through december accordingly  we amortized the remaining deferred revenue balance at the time of the amendment of million on a straight line basis over the remaining exclusive license period  which ended in december 
table of contents in connection with our january strategic transaction with genzyme corporation  genzyme agreed to pay us a total of million  of which million was paid on january  and million was subject to a holdback by genzyme to satisfy certain potential indemnification obligations in exchange for the assignment and licensing of certain intellectual property to genzyme 
our on going performance obligations to genzyme under the collaboration  license and purchase agreement the clp agreement  as described below  including our obligation to deliver certain intellectual property improvements to genzyme  if improvements are made during the initial five year collaboration period  were deemed to be undelivered elements of the clp agreement on the date of closing 
accordingly  we deferred the initial million in cash received at closing and are amortizing that up front payment on a straight line basis into revenue over the initial five year collaboration period ending in january we received the first holdback amount of  which included accrued interest  due from genzyme during the first quarter of and the second holdback amount of  which included accrued interest  due from genzyme during the third quarter of the amounts were deferred and are being amortized on a straight line basis into revenue over the remaining term of the collaboration at the time of receipt 
in addition  genzyme purchased  shares of our common stock on january   for per share  representing a premium of per share above the closing price of our common stock on that date of per share 
the aggregate premium paid by genzyme over the closing price of our common stock on the date of the transaction of million is deemed to be a part of the total consideration for the clp agreement 
accordingly  we deferred the aggregate million premium and are amortizing that amount on a straight line basis into revenue over the initial five year collaboration period ending in january in total  we recognized approximately million in license fee revenue in connection with the amortization of the up front payments and holdback amounts from genzyme during the year ended december  stock based compensation 
in accordance with gaap  all stock based payments  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan espp if certain parameters are not met  are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the following assumptions are used in determining fair value for employee stock options and espp shares valuation and recognition the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated fair value of employee stock options is recognized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
expected term the company uses the simplified calculation of expected life  described in the sec s staff accounting bulletins and  as the company does not currently have sufficient historical exercise data on which to base an estimate of expected term 
using this method  the expected term is determined using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted 
expected volatility expected volatility is based on the company s historical stock volatility data over the expected term of the awards 
risk free interest rate the company bases the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 

table of contents forfeitures the company records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
awards granted in and are all expected to vest and no forfeiture rate was utilized 
the fair value of each restricted stock award and restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the closing stock price on that day 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions in note to our financial statements 
third party royalty obligation pursuant to the terms of the agreement the company has with labcorp  we agreed to reimburse labcorp million for certain third party royalty payments 
based on anticipated sales of colosure  as of december   we accrued a total of  related to the total potential remaining liability of million 
as of december  we had paid million in payments to labcorp  to fully satisfy this liability 
we recorded charges of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively  in connection with this third party royalty obligation 
these charges were recorded under the caption product royalty fees in our statements of operations 
tax positions a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets is reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company has incurred significant losses since its inception and due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future taxable income  management has determined that a million and million valuation allowance at december  and is necessary to reduce the tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the change in valuation allowance for the current year is million 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the company s effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  asu 
these amendments  effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december   result in common definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure requirements between us gaap and ifrs 
asu clarifies or changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operation

this guidance is effective retrospectively for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december   and requires presentation of total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the pronouncement does not change the current option for presenting components of other comprehensive income  gross  or net of the effect of income taxes  provided that such tax effects are presented in the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
additionally  the pronouncement does 
table of contents not affect the calculation or reporting of earnings per share 
the pronouncement also does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured  or when such items must be reclassified to net income 
the company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu  which deferred the requirement to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income while the fasb further deliberates this aspect of the proposal 
the amendments contained in asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the amendments also do not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
asu  as amended by asu  is effective for us on january  results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fee payments associated with our amended license agreement with labcorp and our collaboration  license and purchase agreement with genzyme 
the unamortized labcorp up front payment was amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period  which ended in december the unamortized genzyme up front payment and holdback amounts are being amortized on a straight line basis over the initial genzyme collaboration period  which ends in january revenues also include royalties on labcorp s sales of colosure as well as charges for our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp which are recorded as reductions to revenue under financial accounting guidance 
the decrease in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period of was primarily the result of the labcorp up front payment being fully amortized into revenue at december   research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increased research and development activities in support of our efforts to develop and seek fda clearance or approval for our cologuard test 
the increase in research and development expenses included increases of million in professional fees  million in trial related expenses  million in personnel related expenses  million in lab related expenses  million in non cash stock based compensation expenses  million in other research and development expenses  and million in license and royalty fees 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by a decrease in research collaborations of million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in general and administrative expenses includes increases of million in legal and professional fees  million in non cash stock based compensation expenses  million in other general and administrative costs  and million in personnel related expenses

sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase in sales and marketing expenses includes increases of million in personnel related expenses  million in non cash stocked based compensation expenses  and million in other sales and marketing expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of million 
interest income 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an overall higher cash balance during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this slight increase was due to additional interest expense recognized from our loan from the wisconsin department of commerce 
other income 
there was no other income for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the receipt of a grant for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project issued by the federal government in which was not available in comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period of was primarily the result of the receipt in of the genzyme holdback amounts of million which are being amortized on a straight line basis into revenue over the collaboration period 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increased research and development activities in support of our efforts to develop and seek fda clearance or approval for our cologuard test 
the increase in research and development expenses included increases of million in personnel related expenses  million in lab related expenses  million in research collaborations  million in professional fees  million in non cash stock based compensation expenses  and million in other research and development expenses 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by a decrease in license and royalty fees of million due primarily to million of non cash stock based expenses recognized in related to common stock warrants issued by us in june to the mayo clinic foundation pursuant to our license agreement with the mayo clinic foundation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of million in transaction costs related to the genzyme strategic transaction in january  including million in legal  audit  and investment banking fees as well as approximately million in retention bonus payments made to employees pursuant to board approved retention agreements 
also contributing to this overall decrease was a reduction in non cash stock based compensation expense of million in compared to  as well as a decrease of million in personnel related costs 
these decreases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by increases of million in other general and administrative costs 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of increased sales and marketing efforts and activities in support of our efforts to develop and commercialize our cologuard test 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to less favorable interest rates for cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was due to one month of interest expense recognized at december  compared to a full year of interest expense recognized at december  from our loan from the wisconsin department of commerce 
other income 
other income increased to  for the year ended december  from none for the year ended december  this increase was due to the receipt of a grant for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project issued by the federal government in which was not available in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  cash received from labcorp in connection with our license agreement with labcorp  and cash received in january from genzyme in connection with the genzyme strategic transaction 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in marketable securities 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended december   and was to fund our net loss 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to increased research and development activities 
the increase for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was also primarily due to increases in research and development activities 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in our operations  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and   respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in was the result of increased purchases of marketable securities 
excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  which was primarily the result of an increase in purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of purchases of property and equipment 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in was primarily the result of a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of common stock from million in to million in excluding the impact of the sale of common stock  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  this decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the genzyme strategic transaction from million for the year ended december  to none for the year ended december   and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   slightly offset by the decrease in restricted cash of million during the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in was primarily the result of an increase in the proceeds from the sale of common stock from million in to million in we expect that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months  based on current operating plans 
however  since we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to fully fund our current strategic plan  the primary goal of which is developing and commercializing an fda cleared approved non invasive sdna colorectal pre cancer and cancer screening test 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds to enable us to fund our operations through the completion of such plan  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected and we may be required to delay the implementation of our plan and otherwise scale back our operations 
even if we successfully raise sufficient funds to complete our plan  we cannot assure you that our business will ever generate sufficient cash flow from operations to become profitable 
the table below reflects our estimated fixed obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period description total less than one year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations obligations under license and collaborative agreements operating lease obligations total includes expected interest payments related to long term debt obligations we have entered into license and collaborative agreements with johns hopkins university  the mayo foundation  genzyme  mdx health formerly oncomethylome sciences  and hologic  inc see note in the notes to the financial statements for further information 
commitments under license agreements generally expire concurrent with the expiration of the intellectual property licensed from the third party 
operating leases reflect remaining obligations associated with the leased facility at our headquarters in madison  wi 

table of contents net operating loss carryforwards at december   the company had federal net operating loss and state net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and million  respectively for financial reporting purposes  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
the company also had federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively which may be used to offset future income tax liability 
the federal and state carryforwards expire beginning through and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service 
in the event of a change of ownership  the federal and state net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in securities of the us governments and its agencies and in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of commercial paper  bank certificates of deposit and corporate bonds and  as of december  and december  were classified as available for sale 
we place our cash equivalents and marketable securities with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
