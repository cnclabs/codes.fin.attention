overview virtualscopics  inc is a leading provider of imaging solutions to accelerate drug and medical device development 
we have developed a robust software platform for analysis and modeling of both structural and functional medical images 
in combination with our industry leading experience and expertise in advanced imaging biomarker measurement  this platform provides a uniquely clear window into the biological activity of drugs and devices in clinical trial patients  allowing our customers to make better decisions faster 
revenue over the past ten years has been derived primarily from image processing services in connection with pharmaceutical drug trials 
for these services  we have been concentrating in the areas of oncology and osteoarthritis 
we have also derived a small portion of revenue from consulting services  and pharmaceutical drug trials in the neurology and cardiovascular areas 
we expect that the concentration of our revenue will continue in these services and in those areas in revenues are recognized as the mri and ct images that we process are quantified and delivered to our customers and or the services are performed 
beginning in  we began to pursue the personalized medicine market  however  we do not anticipate significant revenues from this market opportunity in as we are just beginning the process of executing on our regulatory  validation and commercialization strategy 
as of december   the amount remaining to be earned from active projects and awards was approximately million 
once we enter into a new contract for participation in a drug trial  there are several factors that can effect whether we will realize the full benefits under the contract  and the time over which we will realize that revenue 
customers may not continue our services due to performance reasons with their compounds in development 
furthermore  the contracts may contemplate performance over multiple years 
therefore  revenue may not be realized in the fiscal year in which the contract is signed or the award is made 
recognition of revenue under the contract may also be affected by the timing of patient recruitment and image site identification and training 
additionally  the majority of contracts we have with customers are cancelable for any reason by giving days advance notice

of the revenues recognized during  were derived from image analysis work  which tends to have lower margins  compared to derived from image analysis work in start up activities associated with getting a project underway  including site initiation  qualification and training  yield a higher margin than image analyses 
in  a higher percent of our business came from site initiation activities as we began work on several phase iii studies 
therefore  depending on the project mix  we may experience fluctuations in our reported margins 
research and development research and development costs increased in by  or  to  when compared to the increase was due to hiring within our software development group at the end of and early our research and development efforts center around refining our processes through the use of our software platform in order to gain efficiencies which we believe will better allow us to standardize our processes as we scale our business
