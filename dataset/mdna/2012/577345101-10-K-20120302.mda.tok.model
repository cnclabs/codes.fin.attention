interest expense interest expense was  for compared to  for of which  and  were included in discontinued operations in and  respectively 
the reduction in interest expense was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average borrowings in in august  our million convertible notes were extinguished and in december  we modified our primary credit agreements which lowered the interest rates note to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report

in july  we paid down the line of credit with million of proceeds from the sale of real estate and in august  the line of credit agreement was modified to reserve million of credit availability for the payment of legacy costs as defined and exclude million from the credit line availability in the calculation of the minimum liquidity financial covenant 
as of december   the amount reserved for legacy costs and excluded from credit availability has been reduced by million as legacy costs were paid 
there are no commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving facility

amended construction loan agreement with lehman brothers holdings inc bay holdings has a construction loan agreement with lehman and other lenders under which million was outstanding at december  that is due and payable in full 
the loan is collateralized by the residences of kapalua bay project assets including the land that underlies the project  which is owned by bay holdings 
we and the other members of bay holdings have guaranteed to the lenders completion of the project and recourse with regard to certain acts  but have not guaranteed payment of the loan 
construction of the project was completed in  but the completion guaranty will remain in place until all construction contracts have been fully settled and paid 
we have recorded million in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as our estimated share of the completion and recourse guarantees  and do not have any other funding commitments to bay holdings 
bay holdings is currently working with the lenders to settle the terms of the loan 

table of contents operating cash flows net cash used in operating activities for and was million and million  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for increased from primarily due to million of income tax refunds received in  partially offset by a higher amount of interest paid in compared to interest paid in and was million and million  respectively 
tax refunds received in and were  and million  respectively 
investing and financing cash flows cash provided by investing activities in included the following million from the sale of approximately acres of our former agriculture facility in kahului 
 released from escrow upon completion of post closing obligations related to asset sales in cash used in investing activities in included the following million withheld in escrow after the closing of the sale of the kahului property 
cash provided by investing and financing activities in included the following significant transactions gross proceeds from our rights offering were million 
sale of the bay course produced net cash proceeds of million 
sale of three properties and miscellaneous equipment that were used in operations produced cash proceeds of million 
cash used in investing and financing activities in included the following significant transactions net payments of long term debt totaled million 
this included million of proceeds from the sale of the bay course and million of proceeds from the rights offering that were applied to pay down outstanding borrowings 
cash outflow for property purchases was million and was primarily for the replacement of the irrigation system at the pgc as required by the sale of the golf course in future cash inflows and outflows our plans for include the possible sale of certain operating and non operating real estate assets that could result in net cash proceeds which would be partially used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general working capital 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any of our real estate assets on acceptable terms  if at all 
our cash outlook for the next twelve months and our ability to continue to meet our financial covenants is highly dependent on selling certain real estate assets in a difficult market 
if we are unable to meet our financial covenants resulting in the borrowings becoming immediately due  we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay such outstanding borrowings 
in addition  we are subject to several commitments and contingencies that could negatively impact our future cash flows  including purchase commitments up to million related to our investment in bay holdings to purchase the amenities  an eeoc matter related to our discontinued agricultural operations  and funding requirements related to our defined benefit pension plans 
these matters are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the aforementioned circumstances raise substantial doubt about 
table of contents our ability to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve the initiatives discussed below in order to continue as a going concern 
in response to these circumstances  we continue to undertake significant efforts to generate cash flow by employing our real estate assets in leasing and other arrangements  by the sale of several real estate assets and by continued cost reduction efforts 
as part of the restructured credit agreement with wells fargo  we are allowed to use proceeds from the sale of certain properties to settle obligations related to our prior operations  instead of reducing borrowings under the line of credit as was previously required in the credit agreement 
we are currently in discussions with the other members of bay holdings and the lenders to negotiate the terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the amenities including the purchase and payment terms 
contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately million in we do not expect any significant capital expenditures in critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in summary of significant accounting policies  note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of accounting estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions involve a high level of subjectivity and judgment and therefore the impact of a change in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to the consolidated financial statements are as follows our investment in bay holdings was written down to zero at december  to recognize an other than temporary impairment and to record losses incurred by bay holdings in the third quarter of we and the other members of bay holdings have guaranteed to the lenders completion of the project and recourse with regard to certain acts  and we have recorded million in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  as our share of the completion and recourse guarantees 
in determining the fair value of this investment  assessing whether any identified impairment was other than temporary  as well as estimating the liability for the completion and recourse guarantees  significant estimates were made and considerable judgment was involved 
these estimates and judgments were based  in part  on our current and future evaluation of economic conditions in general  as well as bay holdings current and future plans 
these impairment calculations contain additional uncertainties because they also require management to make assumptions and apply judgments to  among others  estimates of future cash flows  probabilities related to various cash flow scenarios  and appropriate discount rates 
the impairment losses recorded by bay holdings required bay holdings management to estimate total sales revenues that will be received by the project  as well as estimating the number of buyers of units from which nonrefundable deposits have been received that will not close on the purchase of their units 
our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset may not be recoverable 
management has evaluated certain long lived assets for impairment  and in we recognized impairment charges of million related to long lived assets and in recognized impairment charges totaling million related to real estate assets held for sale because carrying values were in excess of estimated fair values less the estimated costs of disposal 
these asset impairment loss analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to  among others  estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows  expected useful lives of the assets  uncertainty about future events  including changes in 
table of contents economic conditions  changes in operating performance  changes in the use of the assets  and ongoing costs of maintenance and improvements of the assets  thus  the accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  our financial condition or future operating results could be materially impacted 
deferred development costs  principally predevelopment costs and offsite development costs related to various projects in the planning stages by our real estate segment  totaled million at december  based on our future development plans for the kapalua resort and other properties such as pulelehua  and hali imaile town  and the estimated value of these future projects  management has concluded that these deferred costs will be recoverable from future development projects 
the volatility of this assumption arises because of the long term nature of our development plans and the uncertainty of when or if certain parcels will be developed 
determining pension expense for our two defined benefit pension plans utilizes actuarial estimates of employees age at retirement  and retirees life span  the long term rate of return on investments and other factors 
in addition  pension expense is sensitive to the discount rate utilized 
this rate should be commensurate with the interest rate yield of a high quality corporate fixed income investment portfolio 
these assumptions are subject to the risk of change as they require significant judgment and have inherent uncertainties that management or its consulting actuaries may not control or anticipate 
as of december   the fair value of the assets of our defined benefit plans totaled approximately million  compared with million as of december  the recorded net pension liability was approximately million as of december  compared to a net pension liability of million as of december  the million increase in net pension liability during was mainly attributed to a decline in the discount rate used to determine our pension obligations and lower than expected returns from the pension plans investments 
stock based compensation expense is calculated based on assumptions as to the expected life of the options  price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected forfeitures 
while management believes that the assumptions made are appropriate  compensation expense recorded currently and future compensation expense would vary based on the assumptions used 
management calculates the income tax provision  current and deferred income taxes along with the valuation allowance based upon various complex estimates and interpretations of income tax laws and regulations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
to the extent we begin to generate taxable income in future years  and it is determined the valuation allowance is no longer required  the tax benefit for the remaining deferred tax assets will be recognized at such time 
as of december   valuation allowances of million have been established primarily for tax credits  net operating loss carry forwards  and accrued retirement benefits to reduce future tax benefits expected to be realized 
our results of operations could be affected by significant litigation or contingencies adverse to the company  including  but not limited to  liability claims  environmental matters  and contract terminations 
we record accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we make adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter 
predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from those estimates 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation 
table of contents matters  we consider many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the nature of specific claims  our experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed  input from outside legal counsel  the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter s current status 
a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters and contingencies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
impact of inflation and changing prices most of the land owned by us was acquired from to and is carried at cost 
at the kapalua resort  some of the fixed assets were constructed and placed in service in the mid to late s 
depreciation expense would be considerably higher if fixed assets were stated at current cost
