item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in part ii  item selected financial data 
overview the company reported record consolidated net income of million  more than double the company s best previous year on record  driven by strong pgm prices and good operating performance 
supply and demand fundamentals for palladium and platinum  the company s primary products  looked very favorable as dawned  but then suffered the consequences as the year progressed of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in japan  rampant flooding in thailand  and fiscal instability in europe 
the company made substantial progress in strengthening its safety culture and reducing incident rates during but unfortunately experienced a tragic fatality in a single vehicle accident underground at the stillwater mine during the fourth quarter 
the company made progress during on all of its key strategic initiatives 
operationally  mining productivities were good despite the potential for distraction during labor negotiations at mid year  and in fact ore production rates peaked for the year during contract negotiations 
a new labor agreement was ratified by represented employees at the stillwater mine and processing facilities in early july  and the east boulder mine s represented employees ratified their new contract just prior to year end  six months ahead of the scheduled expiration of their prior agreement 
the company was able to focus on strengthening the developed state of the mines and replacing equipment during  partially compensating for the lower rate of spending during 
table of contents and expanded and enhanced new miner training programs also got under way at both mines during the year  which is necessary to address  in part  the company s anticipated need for miners as the blitz and graham creek projects come on line in the future 
with regard to the company s palladium market development initiative  a new marketing campaign to enhance consumer awareness of palladium jewelry was introduced widely in september  with articles and image advertising in key fashion publications 
palladium jewelry also was well represented on celebrities at the oscars  golden globe awards and other red carpet events 
the palladium alliance international pai  an industry trade group in which the company plays a key role  attended major jewelry industry trade shows during the year  supporting manufacturers and retailers of palladium jewelry 
currently  the pai receives its funding from the company 
the company contributed million to pai in which is included as marketing expense on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company s growth and diversification initiative progressed on several fronts during in montana  the blitz and graham creek projects adjacent to the company s existing mines in the j m reef both advanced 
at graham creek  the existing tbm developed about  feet of new footwall lateral to the west of the east boulder mine during the year 
at that point  the tbm was idled for a time while the company conducted core drilling in the newly developed section  defining additional mineable resource along the reef that likely will begin active mining within the next two or three years 
at blitz  the receiving chamber for the new tbm was developed during the year  anticipating delivery of a refurbished machine during the second quarter of initial permitting work on the new eastern surface access to the blitz project also got underway during in october  the company completed the acquisition of peregrine whose principal assets are the altar copper gold porphyry exploration project and the nearby quebrada de la mina gold discovery in the san juan province of argentina 
the company intends to spend about million per year over the next three years better defining this resource and conducting an engineering study 
only after those programs are completed will the company need to decide how best to proceed in developing this potentially large mining project 
in the company also advanced its efforts to complete an environmental assessment and began permitting efforts on its marathon pgm copper project near the north shore of lake superior in ontario  canada 
company priorities and financing in response to the steep deterioration in pgm prices during the second half of  the company restructured its operations  focusing its business plans for and on conserving cash and maintaining the company s liquidity and financial condition 
as a result  the company transferred miners and laid off about of its total employee workforce  terminated most contractors  adjusted the company s mining processes  relocated the company s corporate offices  and severely restricted operating and capital expenditures 
in total  the company reduced its workforce by employees between september and march and by another positions during the remainder of by march of  the miner workforce at the east boulder mine had been reduced to from  while transfers to the stillwater mine had increased the number of miners there to from at the same time  the company eliminated contractor positions  mostly at the stillwater mine 
the company also sharply reduced support staffing at all locations 
several corporate programs  including market development  recruiting  exploration and investor relations  were eliminated or sharply curtailed in and remained restricted during capital spending for the montana operations was reduced to just million in  as compared to million in and in the financial crises in significantly affected the company and caused the company to scale back capital and operating expenditures in an effort to conserve cash and meet its liquidity needs 
the company s experience in navigating through this period emphasized the importance of being financially prudent and maintaining the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment 
during the last three years  metal prices have seen wide swings  driven at different times by industrial growth in china  the earthquake and tsunami in japan  the european financial crises and various other factors 
with the recovery in pgm prices  the company has been able to initiate expansion projects and also to increase its capital expenditures on projects which in certain cases had been deferred 
as the fundamentals of the pgm markets recovered and gained strength during  the company assembled a special planning team to review and prioritize additional pgm development opportunities within the company s holdings along the j m reef 
these opportunities were grouped into nine different potential projects  each of which was evaluated based on several criteria  including grade potential  likely capital and operating costs  time and complexity to implement  and ease of access 
two of these opportunities emerged as clear favorites the blitz and graham creek projects 
the company also successfully completed the marathon and peregrine acquisitions in and  involving exploration projects in canada and argentina  respectively 
these acquisitions also were a move towards addressing the company s longstanding concern regarding the need to diversify its operations beyond the stillwater and east boulder mines in montana 
looking ahead  the company s activities are primarily directed toward the mining and sale of pgms  including the recycling operations 
the key importance of pgms to the company will not change for the foreseeable future 
largely dependent on pgm market prices  the company s cash flow from operations is critical to supporting ongoing operations  including the mine expansion 
table of contents initiatives and completing the delineation and engineering work associated with the marathon and altar projects 
the marathon and altar projects will ultimately require substantial capital for constructing the mines and corollary infrastructure costs that cannot yet be estimated with any precision 
while the company s cash flow from operations will play an important role in contributing to the development of marathon and altar  the company expects that funding from the financial markets or in conjunction with third party investment will also be involved 
the availability and form of any future financing will depend on future market conditions and opportunities 
moreover  the determination to proceed with construction and development of these properties is expected to be made only when it is clear that the economics support such steps and a plan is in place with respect to the requisite financing 
the company sought to raise funds through a senior debt offering in early september of however  market conditions deteriorated during the offering and the company withdrew the issue  determining that it was not in the company s best interest to proceed in the face of interest rates at unacceptably high levels 
the company expects to return to the financing markets when conditions are appropriate 
the company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   as well as million of short term highly liquid investments 
the company also has entered into a new million asset backed revolving credit facility 
available capacity under the line was about million at december   none of which was drawn 
depending upon the needs and circumstances  the company also retains a degree of year to year flexibility in its capital commitments 
it is likely that the company will need to be in a position to redeem its outstanding convertible debentures at par in march of on a relatively near term basis and taking into account the company s planned capital expenditures  expansion initiatives  delineation and engineering work associated with marathon and altar  and the likely need to refinance the outstanding convertible debentures  the company may need access to additional financing beyond its available cash and ability to draw funds under its new working capital line of credit 
there can be no assurance that the financial markets will be receptive to such an offering or that terms will be deemed acceptable 
the company is proceeding with its business in a prudent manner but with the underlying belief that capital raising opportunities will occur from time to time and that the company will need to be in a position to take advantage of such opportunities 
this may present a liquidity risk to the company and or may require the company to further curtail operations or plans 
principal factors affecting the company the surface expression of the j m reef which the company controls is about miles long and was originally part of a much larger reef structure located several miles deep in the earth 
when the beartooth mountains were formed as part of the rocky mountain uplift laramide orogeny about million years ago  this portion of the reef was broken off from the larger structure as it was uplifted in the mountain 
the underground resource the company is now mining is about a mile in vertical extent  generally about five feet thick  and is typically found tilted up at an angle of about although this angle varies considerably depending on location 
pgm ore grades in the j m reef are some of the highest in the world with comparatively low mining cost per ounce  but they are palladium rich and  because of the uplifted configuration of the reef  complex to mine 
the mines compete primarily with the platinum rich pgm ore reserves within south africa s bushveld complex and with the nickel mines in the russian federation 
the bushveld resources are less steeply dipping than the j m reef but today tend to be deep underground which generally results in comparatively higher mining costs per ounce 
the russian nickel mines of norilsk nickel produce palladium rich pgms as a major by product of their nickel operations and so at a very low marginal cost 
consequently  the company s financial performance relative to its peers depends not only on the level of pgm prices  but also on the differential between the price of platinum and the price of palladium 
in periods of low pgm prices  and in particular when palladium prices also are low relative to platinum prices  the company s palladium rich production may put it at a disadvantage to comparable mines in south africa 
other less significant pgm mining sources are the great dike in zimbabwe and the predominantly nickel operations of vale  xstrata and north american palladium in canada 
see business  risk factors and properties risk factors the company may be competitively disadvantaged as a primary pgm producer with a preponderance of palladium with a us dollar based cost structure for further discussion 
the stillwater mine  one of the company s two montana mining operations  is situated near the town of nye toward the eastern end of the j m reef 
the mine s primary portals are located on the surface at  feet above sea level  with principal access through two horizontal adits located on either side of the stillwater valley and a shaft and hoist extending vertically down from the surface to about  feet underground below the valley floor 
the stillwater mine first opened twenty five years ago in and currently has developed portions of the reef along about six horizontal miles on various levels underground ranging from about the  foot level at the deepest up to  feet above sea level 
typically  the lower portion of the stillwater mine accessed from the shaft appropriately known as the off shaft area has contained relatively high ore grades  but the ore in this area is found in pods and tends to be inconsistent with respect to continuity  grade and thickness along the reef 
by contrast  the western portion of the mine above the  level the upper west area generally has somewhat lower ore grades but the ore in this area is relatively consistent as to continuity  grade and thickness along the reef 
overall ounce production at the stillwater 
table of contents mine  then  is sensitive not only to the ore tons produced from each of these areas  but also  in view of the grade difference  to the relative proportion of total ore produced from each area 
in  the mine produced  ounces of palladium and platinum up from  ounces in and generated sales revenues of million 
at december   the mine had employees  including miners 
the company s other montana mine  the east boulder mine  is located southeast of big timber and mcleod in the gallatin national forest  on the western portion of the j m reef 
it is accessed by two parallel  foot horizontal rail adits that intersect the reef perpendicularly at the  foot elevation deep within the mountain 
the mine first opened in  and has developed along about horizontal miles of the j m reef underground  with operations on different levels ranging from about  to  feet above sea level 
during  the east boulder mine produced  ounces of palladium and platinum compared to  ounces in with sales revenue of million 
at the end of  the mine had employees  including miners 
the company recycles spent catalyst materials through its processing facilities along interstate in columbus  montana  recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
recycling has proven to be a profitable ancillary activity 
however  the recycling business has also proven to be very sensitive to pgm prices volumes of recycling material available in the market drop very sharply when pgm prices decline  as does the profitability of the business 
the company believes it enjoys certain competitive advantages in the recycling business 
the smelting and refining complex in columbus montana already processes mined pgm concentrates  which contain not only pgms  but also significant quantities of nickel and copper as by products 
copper and nickel sulfides from the ore concentrates bind with the pgms from recycling in the smelter and so aid in collecting the pgms 
consequently  the company is able to recycle catalyst material within its system at an incremental cost lower than other processors 
moreover  the company also believes the physical location of its processing facilities provides a logistical advantage over smelters in europe and south africa 
and as described below  the company has recently introduced certain technological innovations that may contribute further to its competitive advantage 
the company has taken steps over the past several years to reposition itself in the recycling business 
in may  the company commissioned a new electric furnace in the columbus smelter  increasing throughput capacity and creating backup furnace capacity in the event of planned or unforeseen outages 
during the third quarter  the company commissioned a dedicated catalyst processing and sampling plant that allows for the segregation and handling of multiple batches of recycling material simultaneously 
in early  the company commissioned a new state of the art assay laboratory which utilizes an automated x ray facility that provides accurate results with faster turnaround times than conventional fire assay methods 
new laboratory software supports this automated x ray system  as well as other laboratory processes 
in acquiring recycled automotive catalysts  the company advances certain funds to its suppliers ahead of actually receiving material in order to facilitate procurement efforts 
prior to these working capital advances often were very substantial and represented significant financial exposure for the company 
however  following the steep drop in pgm prices during the second half of  which resulted in large inventory losses for many of the company s suppliers and led to the company ultimately writing off about million of such advances as uncollectible  the company revisited its recycling business model 
in general  the company now only advances funds to suppliers when the associated material for recycling is awaiting transit or is already in transit to the columbus processing facilities 
the new recycling sampling and assay facilities will allow the company to accelerate final settlements with suppliers  thereby reducing the amount of working capital they require and partially offsetting the competitive disadvantage of curtailing longer term advances 
outstanding procurement advances that were not backed up by inventory physically in the company s possession totaled million at december   and million at december  
table of contents logo following the collapse in most metal prices during the second half of  platinum and palladium market prices gradually recovered during and generally trended up during most of and  with platinum closing out in london at  per ounce and palladium at per ounce 
pgm prices have been closely correlated with the ratio of the us dollar to the euro in recent years  and they declined beginning in august of in response to european economic uncertainty and associated strengthening of the us dollar 
an additional factor supporting pgm prices in was the introduction of pgm exchange traded funds etfs into the us in january of the etfs have proven to be a popular investment vehicle  although they may increase pricing volatility in the pgm markets 
for example  volumes held by palladium etfs increased over the course of  driving prices still higher by increasing the total demand for palladium while supply was constrained 
however  after peaking at million ounces in february of just before the devastating tsunami hit japan  palladium etf volumes declined to about million total ounces over the remainder of the year  exacerbating the decline in the palladium price over that period as etf volumes were sold 
pgm markets encompass certain important risks 
pgm trading volumes are relatively thin and their markets have limited liquidity  particularly in comparison to markets for other precious metals and the major industrial metals 
consequently  pgm prices historically have been volatile and difficult to forecast 
pgm prices may be affected favorably or unfavorably by numerous factors  including the level of industrial demand  particularly from the automotive sector  supply factors that include changes in mine production and inventory activity  and by shifts in investor sentiment 
in particular  although exports from the russian government inventories appear to have slowed in recent years and are rumored to be nearing depletion  the russian federation does not officially disclose its inventory holdings and there is no sure way to verify that those inventories are actually approaching exhaustion 
recent pgm prices have been comparatively high by historical standards  and to some extent these price levels are likely affected by investor sentiment that could shift away from precious metals if other markets become more attractive or prices edge downward 
the company attempts to manage this market volatility in several ways  including aggressively marketing palladium  by entering into long term supply agreements  in some limited cases through metal hedging  by investing in the developed state of the mines  giving attention to cost controls and by monitoring the company s liquidity closely to provide capacity to bridge periods when pgm prices are low 
automotive demand continued to strengthen  although slowly  in most major markets during after its steep decline during late and and incipient recovery during one statistical source estimated in december that light vehicle sales in north america would total about million units during  up almost from million units in the same source has estimated chinese light vehicle sales for at million units  up modestly from about million units in japanese light vehicle production appears to have declined to about million vehicles in from million in  reflecting the effect of the tsunami in japan and floods in thailand during the year 
worldwide light vehicle production reportedly increased by to million units in  up from about million units in worldwide mine production of palladium and platinum  which had declined since peaking in  initially appeared to strengthen a little during johnson matthey s november interim report  which included data available through september  projected platinum ounces supplied to market increasing by between and and palladium ounces including russian inventory sales increasing by over the same period 
however  since then the south african producers have released their october december operating results  indicating that mine production and sales were severely constrained by safety issues during the quarter 
that suggests that the actual volume of pgms supplied to market in the end may 
table of contents have been flat or actually declined during benefitting the total  however  was a full year of operations at north american palladium s lac des iles mine and vale s sudbury operations in canada  both of which were shut down during part of of real concern in the pgm industry is the lack of an adequate level of reinvestment in the business in recent years 
a few smaller companies  principally in south africa  have invested in developing new mines  and impala has two major new shafts under way  but the amount of new production they are expected to generate will not be sufficient over the longer term to sustain current production levels 
putting in a large new underground mine on the bushveld complex in south africa reportedly requires an investment of more than a billion dollars in a new shaft and takes four or five years to develop 
although current pgm prices may seem comparatively robust in us dollars  rising operating costs and an adverse strong exchange rate for the south african rand have limited the benefit of higher metal prices to south african producers 
as a result  they do not see solid economics that can justify the kinds of new mining investments that need to be made 
when coupled with other challenges in south africa  including safety issues  power shortages  rapidly escalating wage structures  political uncertainty on several fronts  and a critical shortage of experienced professionals  the outlook for adequate future reinvestment there is worrisome 
since finalizing the acquisition of peregrine in october of  the company has had the opportunity to examine more fully the completeness and timing of the various technical studies being prepared on this project 
previously  the company had indicated that a preliminary economic assessment pea for the altar project was likely to be issued during the fourth quarter of considerable effort has been put forth by various experts to date in addressing numerous technical aspects of the altar project 
however  in reviewing this work the company has concluded that the omission from the pea resource model of drilling season results  coupled with large additional areas identified by geological and geophysical interpretation work that are open to potential resource additions  make completing or publishing a pea premature at this time 
the company has commenced an aggressive drilling campaign for the exploration season with approximately  meters of core drilling scheduled  and expects results from the additional drilling and associated fieldwork will result in an update of the resource model for altar in due course 
for the foreseeable future  the company remains solely a primary pgm producer and continues to direct most of its investment focus into pgms 
beyond marathon and the two projects in the j m reef  the company has not identified any other compelling  available pgm opportunities that meet its investment criteria 
in total  the company expects to direct far more of its economic resources into these pgm projects over the next several years than into altar 
results and commentary for the full year  the company reported net income of million  or per fully diluted share  an improvement over the million  or per diluted share  reported for and the loss of million  or per diluted share in steadily strengthening realized prices for palladium and platinum over the course of continued to increase during early  but then flattened out for several months following the japanese tsunami in march that destroyed or shut down auto manufacturing facilities there 
in september of  with the threat of a greek default overhanging the market and driving down the value of the euro  commodity prices generally fell off sharply and remained lower for the balance of the year 
the company s average realized price on sales of mined palladium and platinum was per ounce in  higher than the per ounce average realized in had the sales taken place at market prices without the burden of a price cap then in effect on a portion of platinum sales under the ford contract  the company s average realized price in would have been per ounce 
there were no floor or ceiling prices in effect on the company s pgm sales during the company s mine production of palladium and platinum totaled  ounces in  up compared to  ounces in the increased mine production in relative to was primarily attributable to adverse operational and grade issues experienced in the off shaft area of the stillwater mine during revenues from mining excluding by product revenues  in totaled million  up from million in  on the generally stronger realized prices and volumes in for the company s primary products  palladium and platinum 
stillwater mine s total cash costs a non gaap measure averaged per ounce for the full year  higher than originally planned and above the per ounce actually realized in the year on year increase is attributable to higher labor and materials costs and higher royalties and taxes during  offset in part by the benefit of higher mine production in saleable ounces of palladium and platinum produced at the stillwater mine increased to  ounces in from  ounces produced in capital expenditures at the stillwater mine totaled million in  well ahead of the million spent during  reflecting efforts to catch up on mine development and the replacement of some dated mining equipment 
primary development at the stillwater mine  which includes extensions of footwall laterals and ramps  advanced about  feet during  about behind plan 
secondary development  which includes sills developed within the reef and ramps used for direct access into specific mining stopes  advanced about  feet  behind plan 
diamond drilling footages in at the stillwater mine totaled about  feet  less than planned 

table of contents total cash costs per ounce at the east boulder mine in averaged per ounce  a little higher than plan and higher than the per ounce averaged in as with the stillwater mine  the year on year difference is attributable to increased labor and materials costs  as well as higher royalties and metal taxes as a result of higher pgm prices 
capital expenditures at the mine totaled million in including spending for the  feet of tbm development completed during at graham creek compared to million spent at the east boulder mine in actual primary development at the east boulder mine advanced about  feet during  lagging the plan  while secondary development advanced  feet in  slightly above plan 
in total  development footage at the east boulder mine was about behind plan  reflecting delays in getting a new development crew in place and operating 
diamond drilling footage totaled about  feet at the east boulder mine in  about behind plan  in part driven by the lower primary development footages 
the company is party to a three year palladium supply agreement with gm effective from january  and a one year platinum supply agreement with tiffany co 
one year agreements with johnson matthey and ford are pending and are proceeding on a month to month basis pending finalization 
the company sells the remainder of its mined palladium and platinum under month to month agreements and in the spot market 
pgm prices in all of these sales agreements are essentially market based 
the company s smelter and base metal refinery in columbus  montana process the pgm ore concentrates from the two mines and also recycle spent pgm catalysts from automotive catalytic converters and from other industrial applications  ultimately recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
during  the company fed about  combined ounces of recycled palladium  platinum and rhodium into the smelter  of which more than half was from material purchased directly by the company and the remainder was toll processed on behalf of others for a fee 
total ounces fed to the smelter during were up compared to the  recycling ounces fed in recycling revenues in were million on  combined ounces sold  benefitting from both higher volumes and stronger pgm prices  recycling revenues totaled million on sales of  combined ounces 
in  the company earned million pre tax from recycling operations on revenues of million  reflecting a combined average realization including rhodium of  per sold ounce 
by comparison  in the company earned million from recycling operations on revenues of million  with a combined average realization of  per sold ounce 
total tons of recycling material processed during  including tolled material  averaged tons per day  up from tons per day in strengthening pgm prices in created a greater incentive for suppliers to collect recycling material  and during  the company was able to enter into new sourcing arrangements for catalyst material with several suppliers 
the company s consolidated total available liquidity  expressed as cash plus short term investments  ended at million  comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available for sale investments 
the corresponding year end balance was million  including million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available for sale investments 
however  included the net expenditure of million of cash as part of the acquisition of peregrine metals ltd  thus cash generation in was stronger than the change in the year end balance might indicate 
cash generated from operations during totaled million  up from million in  driven mostly by the higher pgm prices and production volumes in the company incurred no new long term debt during either or  although at the end of the company put in place a million asset backed revolving credit facility 
at the end of  the company s montana workforce totaled  employees  up for the year from  in december about of the net manpower increase was attributable to adding new production and maintenance staff at the mines  including hiring for the new miner training program 
the remainder of the increase was spread evenly over all other functions 
worldwide  the company had  employees at december  the company s environmental performance continued its excellent track record during environmental compliance is a very high priority 
the company has a record of open communication and cooperative  proactive involvement with its neighbors and with local and regional environmental groups 
the company s ground breaking good neighbor agreement with these groups provides a vehicle for facilitating such communication and addressing issues cooperatively 
the company s environmental approach reflects its operational integrity  its product awareness  as pgms are used to clean the environment  and its location sensitivity  given the pristine areas in which the company operates 
outlook the company s operating guidance for currently includes targeted mine production of  combined ounces of palladium and platinum at a total consolidated cash cost of per ounce  and consolidated capital expenditures of million 
the higher projected total cash cost in reflects general inflation in supply costs  higher labor expenses following 
table of contents new four year agreements at both mines  an expanded and enhanced miner training program  and slightly lower anticipated mine production 
capital spending in reflects spending on equipment replacement and mine development  plus improvements at the smelter in columbus  development spending for the blitz and graham creek projects along the j m reef in montana and continuing work at the company s marathon pgm property in canada 
total cash cost per ounce is a non gaap measure of extraction efficiency please see reconciliation of non gaap measures to costs of revenues for a discussion of how this measure is derived 
the plan to produce  ounces of palladium and platinum from the montana operations in represents a decrease from s actual mine production 
factors driving this include continuing variability of mined ore grades  the state of mine development  the ability to retain or attract sufficient skilled miners as the year progresses  and availability of critical equipment 
the company has found from experience that targeting about  ounces per year of production best fits the configuration of the existing mines and seems to optimize mining efficiency 
consequently  the company is not specifically targeting production growth at the stillwater and east boulder mines  but rather is planning to increase pgm output longer term through development of the marathon pgm copper project in canada and potentially from the new blitz and graham creek developments within the j m reef 
the targeted combined average total cash cost of per ounce for the mines compares to the combined average total cash cost per ounce for the year of a projected increase 
the increase in reflects an expected rising cost trend based on receding face and greater production from the east side at the stillwater mine  plus general inflation for wages and materials and the effect of lower planned ounce production during the year 
projected capital expenditures for of million represent an increase of over the million spent during after restricting capital spending in and in order to conserve cash  spending included about million of development and equipment capital at the existing mines to compensate for the spending shortfall in those prior years 
in continuing this program  the capital budget projects capital spending of million at the company s montana operations  including about million for sustaining development work and million in the columbus processing facilities where the company s rebuilt original smelting furnace will be converted to a slag cleaning furnace 
the budget also allocates million for capital needs on the marathon properties and million for the two long term resource delineation projects along the j m reef  blitz and graham creek 
in addition to this capital program  exploration spending for is planned at around million and includes about million for drilling at altar and million for canadian exploration 
exploration spending is expensed as incurred for financial reporting purposes so the sharp increase in exploration spending will adversely affect the company s reported ebitda numbers 
the company has built considerable flexibility into its capital spending plans and has the ability to augment or scale back spending based on changes in pgm prices and available cash flow 
the company s operating permits require that  in conjunction with its mining and processing activities  it must provide adequate financial surety in support of its permit obligations to complete final reclamation and remediation once mining operations cease 
as of december   the company had outstanding approximately million of surety bonds and letters of credit mostly in favor of state and federal agencies to guarantee its final reclamation and other commitments 
regulatory authorities are currently in the midst of updating an environmental impact statement eis on the montana properties  which when finalized will determine whether or not the existing surety amounts are sufficient 
upon completion of the eis process  probably during  it is likely that the company will be required to provide additional surety bond coverage 
as of december   the total amount of financial guarantees behind the surety requirement had been reduced by million 
social considerations although like other publicly traded companies the company primarily seeks to maximize the value it generates for shareholders over time  management believes that ultimately meeting the expectations of its stakeholders is essential to accomplishing that objective 
thus  the company s environmental approach reflects its operational integrity  its product awareness  as pgms are used to clean the environment  and its location sensitivity  given the pristine areas in which the company s operations are located 
because the company operates in some exceptionally pristine locations and produces products that are essential to preserving air quality  careful attention to environmental performance and feedback is critical to and consistent with the company s continuing operations as well as to its favorable reputation 
the company is a key employer in the communities where it operates  and actively supporting the communities where its employees and their families live allows the company to attract highly qualified individuals to these communities 
attractive wages and benefits  coupled with a safe work environment  not only allow the company to be competitive in the market for employees  but also contribute to the health and economic vigor of the communities where it operates 
and investment in state of the art facilities and technologies allows the company to continually deliver high quality products to its customers at a competitive price 
the company s approach to the environment is somewhat unique in the mining industry 
the good neighbor agreement originally signed in and now in its twelfth year  commits the company to work closely with and provide full disclosure to its 
table of contents neighbors and certain regional environmental ngos 
provisions of the agreement include transporting the majority of employees to and from work in buses so as to minimize traffic on rural roads  quarterly meetings among the parties to the agreement to discuss concerns and consider environmental performance  ongoing company funding of an independent engineering firm to monitor and report on the company s environmental records  and open community involvement in company dealings with regulatory agencies 
in addition  the company has traditionally hosted an annual dinner where the environmental community can meet directly with the company s board of directors 
the company s processes overall are designed to minimize their impact on the environment  complying with and in most cases exceeding all applicable regulatory standards 
about of the mined tailings typically are returned to the mine after processing and are used as fill 
the remaining tailings are placed in lined tailings ponds that have been vegetated and contoured to try to match the surrounding topography 
tailings are environmentally inert and are not acid generating 
water from the mines generally meets drinking water standards aside from elevated concentrations of nitrates from the explosives used underground 
these nitrates are treated and removed biologically before any water is discharged 
tailings water is recycled through lined facilities back to the concentrators and not discharged to the environment 
regardless  bioassay of tailings water shows survival of trout fingerlings in periodic tests 
biodiesel blends are used as fuel underground  both for their cleaner exhaust and to reduce carbon footprint 
likewise  in an area noted for its abundance of deer  elk and bear  the stillwater mine also hosts a large herd of bighorn sheep that winter on the mine property and can be regular visitors to the mine parking lot 
the smelter and refinery in columbus  montana both use closed loop processes with almost zero fugitive emissions 
the smelter is fully scrubbed to eliminate so emissions while the scrubbers produce synthetic gypsum calcium sulfate which is licensed for use by farmers as a soil amendment and for water treatment 
stack emissions are monitored continuously and critical processes can be shut down automatically if so emissions were to exceed permitted levels 
they never have 
particulate dust in the scrubber stream is filtered using gore tex membranes and returned to the smelter 
all process water on the property is either emitted as steam or evaporated 
storm water is segregated from contact with process materials and routed to infiltration galleries 
slag from the smelter is cooled and recycled back to the mines for reprocessing 
the company currently is converting one of the smelter furnaces for slag cleaning  which should increase pgm recoveries and may reduce the volume of slag to be reprocessed 
the health  safety and environmental committee of the board of directors  meets regularly to review the company s performance in these key areas 
its charter includes mandates i to review the company s environmental and occupational health and safety policies and programs  ii to oversee its environmental and occupational health and safety performance  and iii to monitor current and future regulatory issues 
with regard to employee health  the company s medical benefits include a wellness program for employees and their families intended to encourage and educate regarding good health practices 
the program includes annual physical checkups  targeted programs for specific health risks  and monthly themes related to physical  emotional and mental health issues 
on the safety front  the company has engineered safe practices into all work tasks and trains to those standards 
the company continually works to establish and maintain a multifaceted culture of safety  summarized by the slogan  everyone goes home safe every day 
safety programs include incident tracking and analysis  near miss reporting  workplace start of shift inspection checklists  team safety meetings  annual refresher training  safety stand downs and financial incentives for working safely 
the company also works closely with msha inspectors to act on their findings and incorporate their suggestions 
management also strives to maintain a consistent tone at the top that gives working safely priority over all other objectives 
while the company s plans are still in the early stages at marathon and altar  management intends to implement these key health  safety and environmental principles and practices for its employees and future operations internationally 
one early step being taken is the effort to establish early on an effective working relationship with the local communities and environmental agencies in the vicinity of these new properties 
experience suggests that building the mutual confidence and trust that such relationships require takes time and patience 
however  the company s history in montana suggests that any effort to develop these projects without fully taking into account the concerns of all the affected stakeholders would be unnecessarily confrontational and expensive 
in light of the environmental protection agency s efforts to regulate carbon dioxide co emissions as a greenhouse gas  the company has reassessed its exposure to likely restrictions on such emissions 
the company s principal sources of co emissions are limited to a comparatively few internal combustion engines in vehicles and mining equipment  and to stationary sources such as mine ventilation and process heaters  dryers and converters that consume natural gas 
as noted above  the company already utilizes buses to transport its workforce to and from the mines and utilizes a blend of biodiesel fuels in its operations which reduces workplace diesel particulate matter emissions and its carbon footprint 
consequently  any taxes or added restrictions on emissions are unlikely to have any direct material effect on the company s operations 
the company s physical exposure to climate change is minimal 
the company s operations are not materially dependent upon weather patterns or seasonal availability of water 
the relatively remote location of the mines presents some exposure to severe weather  particularly winter snowfall that can restrict access to the mine sites  but the company already regularly addresses this issue during the winter months in montana 
similarly  smoke from summer wildfires can temporarily restrict access to the mines  but their duration tends to be relatively short 
probably the company s most significant exposure to greenhouse gas regulation is the potential effects of a substantial longer term 
table of contents movement away from internal combustion engines on the demand for pgms in catalytic converters 
such a major shift in automotive demand could depress pgm prices and impair the company s financial performance 
regulatory constraints on other industries also could affect the price or availability of electricity and other materials necessary for mining  potentially driving up the company s operating costs

liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 
mining productivity rates and ore grades in turn can affect both pgm production and cash costs of production 
net cash flow from operations also includes changes in non cash working capital  including changes to inventories and advances 
at december  and  the company s available balance of cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid short term investments excluding restricted cash was million and million  respectively  and it reported million of debt outstanding at december  and available cash and cash equivalents at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
the company  at interest rate levels prevailing at december   will be required to fund approximately million in total interest payments during related to its outstanding debt obligations 
no principal payments against outstanding debt are scheduled to come due in in december of  standard and poor s upgraded the company s debt rating from b to b  citing improved market conditions and adequate liquidity 
in july moody s investors service upgraded the company s corporate family rating from caa to b with a stable outlook 
both moody s investors service and standard and poor s had downgraded the company s corporate credit rating during as economic conditions deteriorated 
at issue had been the company s strong dependence on its automotive agreements  lack of geographic or product diversity  metal market price volatility  and difficult cost structure 
the company s financial performance is affected by changes in pgm prices 
absent separate hedging arrangements  any change in the price of palladium or platinum generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
at the forecasted mine production level of  combined pgm ounces  a one dollar change in the price of platinum would affect annual cash generated from mining operations by about million  and a corresponding change in the price of palladium would affect annual cash generation from mining operations by about million 
the sensitivity of the recycling business to changes in palladium and platinum prices is more muted and varies according to the provisions in the various recycling agreements 
in the company s recycling activities  upon purchasing recycled material for processing the company simultaneously enters into a fixed forward contract that determines the future selling price of the contained pgms  effectively locking in a sales margin 

table of contents changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or about  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  during the third quarter of  the company revised its cash management guidelines to extend the available investment maturities on a portion of its cash balances  broaden the suite of permissible investments  and adjust the percentage limits on certain classes of investments 
as a result  during most of the company s cash holdings were transferred into short term investments 
all of these short term investments remain highly liquid  but technically they no longer meet the strict definition of cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities primarily represent capital expenditures and net sales and purchases of short term investments 
capital expenditures totaled million of which million was included in payables at december   million and million in  and  respectively 
the company also expended million along with million newly issued shares with a fair value upon issuance of million in and million in cash along with newly issued common shares with a fair value of million in to acquire equity interests in exploration companies and properties 
no such acquisitions were made in all significant company wide repair and maintenance costs in connection with planned major maintenance activities are expensed as incurred 
the company does not accrue in advance for major maintenance activities  but  when practicable  tries to disclose in advance in its public filings any planned major maintenance activities that may affect operations 
net cash used in or provided by financing activities equaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
convertible debentures on march   the company issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due in debentures 
the debentures pay interest at per annum  payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing september  the debentures will mature on march   subject to earlier repurchase or conversion 
each  principal amount of debentures is initially convertible  at the option of the holders  into approximately shares of the company s common stock  at any time prior to the maturity date 
the conversion rate is subject to certain adjustments  but will not be adjusted for accrued interest or any unpaid interest 
the conversion rate initially represents a conversion price of per share 
holders of the debentures may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control 
the company may redeem the debentures for cash at any time on or after march  the debentures were sold to an accredited investor within the meaning of rule under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  in reliance upon the private placement exemption afforded by section of the securities act 
the initial investor offered and resold the debentures to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act 
in october  the company undertook the exchange of million face amount of the convertible debentures for million shares of the company s common stock 
because the number of shares issued in this transaction exceeded the shares per  of face value specified in the bond indenture  accounting principles required that the company expense the value of the excess shares as an inducement loss 
consequently  the company recorded a loss on the exchange transaction of million during the fourth quarter of the debentures so acquired have been retired  leaving million face value of the debentures outstanding at december  the outstanding million of convertible debentures will reach their date of first call in march absent a significant change in the share price of the company  the company believes most holders are likely to redeem their debentures at par  or should the share price be at or above the conversion price  convert them into company shares 
if the debentures were to all convert  the company would be required to issue about million new shares of common stock 
if the debentures are redeemed  the company would be required to purchase them at par  which would severely reduce the company s available liquidity 
consequently  it is likely that the company will refinance or restructure these debentures prior to march for discussion of the risks associated with refinancing  see business  risk factors and properties risk factors inability to access the capital markets may adversely affect the company 

table of contents asset backed revolving credit facility on december   the company entered into a million asset backed revolving credit agreement with wells fargo capital finance  incurring initial debt issuance costs of million 
maximum permitted borrowings under this working capital facility at any time are determined by a borrowing base comprised of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventories 
terms of the agreement state that the borrowings will be secured primarily by the company s accounts receivable  metals inventories and other accounts 
the credit agreement includes a financial covenant requiring  whenever the remaining availability under the line is less than of the total borrowing capacity  that the company s fixed charge coverage ratio be at least to it also includes other customary restrictions that become tighter as drawings under the facility increase 
the facility includes a million letter of credit sub facility 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at a spread over the london interbank offer rate that varies from to  decreasing progressively as the percentage drawn against the facility increases 
the company also pays an unused line fee on committed but unutilized commitments under the facility at a rate per annum of or  depending on utilization of the facility 
subsequent to year end  on january   the company completed the syndication of this facility to a group of four banks and simultaneously expanded the maximum line of credit to million 
at december   the company s borrowing base was approximately million however there was no drawn balance under this revolving credit facility at december  contractual obligations the company is obligated to make future payments under various debt agreements and regulatory obligations 
the following table represents significant contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and regulatory commitments  including related interest payments  as of december  in thousands thereafter total convertible debentures exempt facility revenue bonds operating leases asset retirement obligations payments of interest other liabilities total interest payments on the convertible debentures noted in the above table are calculated up to march   the date the holders of the debentures can exercise their put option

the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies production measurement the company s production levels for palladium and platinum are driven by the number of ore tons mined  the mill head grade of the ore and the metallurgical recovery percentages 
the company measures its net mine production in terms of the number of 
table of contents ounces contained in the mill concentrate  adjusted for subsequent processing losses expected to be incurred in smelting and refining 
the company defines an ounce of metal as produced at the time it is transferred from the mine and received at the concentrator 
depletion  depreciation and amortization costs are inventoried at each stage of production 
mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving adits and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground ore body and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the ore body  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new ore bodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate for each relevant geological area within a mine is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs and the related ore reserves associated with that area 
capital development expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related development assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
the company s method of accounting for development costs is as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals  ramps and associated facilities are amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in ore grades or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 

table of contents asset impairment the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the estimation of future cash flows takes into account estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices long term sales contract prices and historical pricing trends or third party projections of future prices rather than prices at a point in time as an indicator of longer term future prices  production levels  and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a determination of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties 
any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions such as pgm prices  lower than expected recoverable ounces  and or the company s operating performance could have a material effect on the company s determination of ore reserves  or its ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long lived assets resulting in potential additional impairment charges 
costs incurred to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations 
costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment 
the company assesses  at least quarterly  whether there has been any event or change in circumstances that might indicate that the carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property  plant and equipment  if any  may not be recoverable out of expected future cash flows and estimated salvage value 
if so  the company then determines if these costs are in excess of their net undiscounted realizable value and  should that be the case  reduces the carrying value of the respective assets to their fair value 
foreign currency transaction with the acquisitions during and of certain canadian and argentinean assets  the company now regularly incurs capital and operating expenditures denominated in a foreign currency 
the company has determined that the functional currency for its subsidiaries is the us dollar and therefore reflects all assets  liabilities and expenditures in us dollars for accounting purposes 
the company uses a monthly average exchange rate for converting minor foreign currency expenditures into us dollars  and uses the actual exchange rate incurred in accounting for larger transactions 
for balance sheet purposes  monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are recorded based on the exchange rate at the end of the respective period 
any net accounting difference that results from exchange rate differences is recorded as a foreign exchange gain or loss for the relevant period on the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes with the acquisition during the fourth quarter of of certain canadian assets  the company now is subject to canadian federal and provincial income taxes on its canadian activities as well as to us state and federal income taxes 
with the acquisition during the fourth quarter of of certain south american assets  the company is subject to federal income taxes in argentina  chile and peru on its south american activities as well as to us state and federal income taxes 
income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred taxes associated with the company s canadian activities are recorded using the assumption that future earning and profits associated with these activities will not be repatriated into the us but will be fully utilized in canada 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december  and  for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
the company has significant net operating losses for us income tax purposes which give rise to a substantial deferred tax asset 
in accordance with asc topic  the company regularly projects its ability to utilize this deferred tax asset 
based on pgm prices in the past  the company s estimates of future taxable income have consistently demonstrated it is more likely than not that the company would not realize the benefit of this deferred tax asset 
as a result  the company has recorded a valuation allowance in each reporting period that fully offsets the net deferred tax asset 
however  pgm price levels during permitted the company to utilize a limited portion of the deferred tax asset in at year end pgm prices  such tax projections 
table of contents would indicate an ability to further utilize this asset in the future  within the carryforward period allowed  which suggests that the valuation allowance could be reduced 
nevertheless  historical experience with pgm prices shows that they are exceptionally volatile and even at year end pgm prices the company s tax projections indicate that complete utilization of its net operating loss deferred tax asset would require a significant number of years which extend out to the year while the company believes there are grounds for optimism regarding future pgm prices  the significant historical volatility in these prices has led the company to conclude that it is premature to reduce the valuation allowance at this time as it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will ultimately be utilized in the future 
the company will continue to project its ability to utilize its deferred tax asset  and should pgm prices become more stable in future periods  it may conclude to reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance  which would increase reported earnings in the relevant reporting period 
post closure reclamation costs the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation ultimately is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss at the time of settlement 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of the future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work that the company is required to perform 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
the company reviewed its asset retirement assumptions at december  and  and recorded a reduction at december   of million and million for the stillwater mine and the east boulder mine  respectively  due to an increase in the estimated mine lives of both mines 
no corresponding adjustment was required at december  see note asset retirement obligation to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
derivative instruments the company from time to time enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forward sales  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forward sales to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be highly effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and to manage interest rate risk 
the company also enters into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
see note derivative instruments to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial performance can be materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of fluctuation in prices  the company has entered into long term agreements with suppliers and customers  from time to time has employed various derivative financial instruments and attempts to maintain adequate liquidity to sustain operations during a downturn in pgm prices 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company customarily enters into fixed forward sales and from time to time in the past has entered into financially settled forward sales transactions that may or may not be accounted for as cash flow hedges to mitigate the price risk in its pgm 
table of contents recycling and mine production activities 
under these fixed forward transactions  typically metals contained in the spent catalytic materials are sold forward at the time the materials are purchased and then are delivered against the fixed forward contracts when the finished ounces are recovered 
the company believes such transactions qualify for the exception to hedge accounting treatment provided for in the accounting literature and so has elected to account for these transactions as normal purchases and normal sales 
financially settled forward sales provide another mechanism to offset fluctuations in metal prices associated with future production  particularly in circumstances where the company elects to retain control of the final disposition of the metal 
in financially settled forward sales  the parties agree in advance to a net financial settlement in the future based on the difference between the market price of the metal on the settlement date and a forward price set at inception 
consequently  at the settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price  and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
no metal changes hands between the parties in these financially settled transactions 
the company generally has accounted for financially settled forward transactions as cash flow hedges  as they are not eligible for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales 
however  if the company determines not to document them as cash flow hedges  these transactions are marked to market in each accounting period and the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
as of december  and  the company was not party to any financially settled forward agreements 
periodically  the company also has entered into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses on such transactions therefore are recognized in net income in each period 
interest rate risk at december   all of the company s outstanding long term debt was subject to fixed rates of interest 
interest income on payments to the company s recycling suppliers is generally linked to short term inter bank rates 
the company s convertible debentures and industrial revenue bonds do not contain financial covenants  other than change in control protection and  in the case of the convertible debentures  investor make whole provisions 
the company s asset backed revolving credit facility includes a single fixed charge coverage covenant that only takes effect when less than of the total borrowing capacity under the line remains available 
because there were no drawings under the revolving credit facility at december   the company is not constrained by conventional financial covenants at this time 
foreign currency risk with the acquisition of the marathon assets in canada  the company has gained some modest exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
similarly  the peregrine acquisition will create initially minor exposure to canadian  argentine and other foreign currencies 
while these exposures currently are limited to foreign cash deposits and expenses incurred for the services of a few foreign based employees and contractors  along with some associated support costs  as the company s foreign commitments expand in the future  the exposure will likely become more material 
the company does not generally hedge this exposure at present  but may consider doing so in the future as the scale of its foreign operations grows
