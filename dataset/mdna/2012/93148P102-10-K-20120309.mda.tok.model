item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or contemplated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the headings forward looking statements  and risk factors  elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business we are one of the leading commercial real estate finance companies in the united states  with a primary focus on multifamily loans 
we originate  sell and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate finance products 
we fund loans for gse and hud programs through warehouse facility financings and sell them to investors in accordance with the related loan sale commitment  which we obtain prior to loan closing 
proceeds from the sale of the loan are used to pay off the warehouse facility 
the sale of the loan is typically completed within days after the loan is closed 
in cases where we do not fund the loan  we act as a loan broker and service some of the loans 
our originators who focus on loan brokerage are engaged by borrowers to work with a variety of institutional lenders to find the most appropriate loan instrument for the borrowers needs 
these loans are then funded directly by the institutional lender and we receive an origination fee for placing the loan and a servicing fee for any loans we service 
we recognize gains from mortgage banking activities when we commit to both make a loan to a borrower and sell that loan to an investor 
the gains from mortgage banking activities reflect the fair value attributable to loan origination fees  premiums or losses on the sale of loans  net of any co broker fees  and the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the servicing of loans  net of any guaranty obligations retained 
we also generate revenue from net warehouse interest income we earn while the loan is held for sale in one of our warehouse facilities 
we retain servicing rights on most of the loans we originate  and generate revenues from the fees we receive for servicing the loans  interest income from escrow deposits held on behalf of borrowers  late charges and other ancillary fees 
servicing fees are set at the time an investor agrees to purchase the loan and are generally paid monthly for the duration of the loan 
our fannie mae and freddie mac servicing engagements provide for make whole payments in the event of a voluntary prepayment 
loans serviced outside of fannie mae and freddie mac do not typically require such payments 
we are currently not exposed to interest rate risk during the loan commitment  closing and delivery process 
the sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated prior to establishing the coupon rate for the loan 
we also seek to mitigate the risk of a loan not closing 
we have agreements in place with the gses and hud that specify the cost of a failed loan delivery  also known as a pair off fee  in the event we fail to deliver the loan to the investor 
the pair off fee is typically less than the deposit we collect from the borrower 
any potential loss from a catastrophic change in the property condition while the loan is held for sale using warehouse facility financing is mitigated through property insurance equal to replacement cost 
we are also protected contractually from any failure to close by an investor 
we have experienced only one failed delivery 
we have risk sharing obligations on most loans we originate under the fannie mae dus program 
when a fannie mae dus loan is subject to full risk sharing  we absorb the first of any losses on the unpaid principal balance of a loan  and above we share a percentage of the loss with fannie mae  with our maximum loss capped at of the unpaid principal balance of a loan subject to doubling or tripling if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults 
table of contents within months of its sale to fannie mae 
we may  however  request modified risk sharing at the time of origination  which reduces our potential risk sharing losses from the levels described above 
we regularly request modified risk sharing based on such factors as the size of the loan  market conditions and loan pricing 
we may also request modified risk sharing on large transactions if we do not believe that we are being fully compensated for the risks of the transactions or to manage overall risk levels 
except for the fannie mae dus loans acquired in the column transaction  which were acquired subject to their existing fannie mae dus risk sharing levels  our current credit management policy is to cap each loan balance subject to full risk sharing at million 
accordingly  we currently elect to use modified risk sharing for loans of more than million in order to limit our maximum loss exposure on any one loan to million such exposure would occur in the event that the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss 
our servicing fees for risk sharing loans include compensation for the risk sharing obligations and are larger than the servicing fees we receive from fannie mae for loans with no risk sharing obligations 
we receive a lower servicing fee for modified risk sharing than for full risk sharing 
in january  w d  inc  its affiliate green park  and column  contributed their assets to a newly formed entity  walker dunlop  llc 
the column transaction brought together walker dunlop s competencies in debt origination  loan servicing  asset management  investment consulting and related services  green park s fannie mae dus origination capabilities and column s fannie mae  freddie mac and hud operations  including its healthcare real estate lending business  to form one of the leading providers of commercial real estate financial services in the united states 
substantially all of the assets and liabilities of w d  inc and green park  including its wholly owned subsidiary green park express  llc  were transferred to walker dunlop  llc in exchange for and interests  respectively  in walker dunlop  llc  and certain assets and liabilities of column were transferred to walker dunlop  llc for a interest in walker dunlop  llc 
we acquired from column its billion servicing portfolio  together with its fannie mae  freddie mac and hud operations  which significantly expanded our gse and hud loan origination capabilities 
in december  we completed our initial public offering  pursuant to which we sold  shares and selling stockholders sold  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  resulting in gross proceeds to the company of million 
the offering was completed on december  we received net proceeds of million from the initial public offering after deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and other accrued offering costs 
in connection with our ipo  we completed the formation transaction through which walker dunlop  llc became a wholly owned subsidiary of walker dunlop  inc  a newly formed maryland corporation 
in connection with the formation transaction  members of the walker family  certain of our directors and executive officers and certain other individuals and entities who owned direct and indirect equity interests in walker dunlop  llc contributed their respective interests in such entities to walker dunlop  inc in exchange for shares of our common stock 
our predecessor entities have historically operated as pass through tax entities partnerships  llcs and s corporations 
accordingly  our historical earnings have resulted in only nominal federal and state corporate level expense 
the tax liability has been the obligation of our owners 
upon closing our initial public offering on december   our income became subject to both federal and state corporate tax 
as a result of the formation transaction and change in tax status  we recognized net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding deferred tax expense on the date of our change in status  and recognized income tax expense for the days following the our change in tax status 
on january   we issued an additional  shares of common stock at per share upon the partial exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million 

table of contents in july  we launched our interim loan program that offers floating rate debt  for terms of up to two years  to experienced borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not currently qualify for permanent financing 
we closed our first loan under this program in february under this program  we underwrite the loans originated through the program  and during the time that they are outstanding  we assume the full risk of loss on the loans 
in addition  we service and asset manage loans originated through the program  with the ultimate goal of providing permanent financing on the properties 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
prior to the formation transaction  the financial results of operations include the consolidated financial results of all wholly owned subsidiaries of walker dunlop  inc and entities under common control  which became wholly owned subsidiaries of walker dunlop  inc in completing the formation transaction and closing of our initial public offering 
concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering in december  the investors in the walker dunlop predecessor entities individually and collectively combined the predecessor entities which had been previously operated and reported as companies under common control 
these investors exchanged their member interests for their pro rata interest  adjusted for company specific debt included in the transaction  in  shares in the newly formed company 
this transaction was reported for accounting purposes as a combination of companies under common control and the stock issuance was reported as a stock split 
in accordance with us gaap  all financial reports have been prepared as if the stock split and the combination of the companies under common control had occurred prior to the earliest period presented  certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
use of financial measures to supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap  we use pro forma net income per share  which is a non gaap financial measure 
the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for  or superior to  the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap 
for more information on this non gaap financial measure  refer to the reconciliation of income from operations to pro forma net income  included in our selected financial data above and in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
pro forma net income adjusts income from operations  as reported  by applying our estimated effective federal and state income tax rates as if we were a corporate tax payer for the comparable periods in   and management uses this non gaap measure in comparing the company s operating results with historical performance and believes it provides meaningful and comparable information to management and investors to assist in their review of our performance relative to prior periods and our competitors 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents mortgage servicing rights and guaranty obligations 
msrs are recorded at fair value the day we sell a loan 
the fair value is based on estimates of future net cash flows associated with the servicing rights 
the estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the msr over the estimated life of the underlying loan 
in addition to the msr  for all fannie mae dus loans with risk sharing obligations  upon sale we record the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guaranty non contingent obligation  and the fair value of the expected loss from the risk sharing obligations in the event of a borrower default contingent obligation 
in determining the fair value of the guaranty obligation  we consider the risk profile of the collateral  historical loss experience  and various market indicators 
generally  the estimated fair value of the guaranty obligation is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be paid under the guaranty over the life of the loan historically three to five basis points annually  discounted using a discount rate 
historically  the contingent obligation recognized has been de minimis 
the estimated life and discount rate used to calculate the guaranty obligation are consistent with those used to calculate the corresponding msr 
the msr and associated guaranty obligation are amortized into expense over the estimated life of the loan 
the msr is amortized in proportion to  and over the period  that net servicing income is expected to be received 
the guaranty obligation is amortized evenly over the same period 
if a loan defaults and is not expected to become current or pays off prior to the estimated life  the unamortized msr and guaranty obligation balances are expensed 
we carry the msrs at the lower of amortized value or fair market value and evaluate the carrying value quarterly 
we engage a third party to assist in valuing our msrs on a semi annual basis 
the provision for risk sharing obligations 
the amount of the provision considers our assessment of the likelihood of payment by the borrower or key principal s  the estimated disposition value of the underlying collateral and the level of risk sharing 
historically  the estimate of loss recognition occurs at or before the loan becoming days delinquent 
overview of current business environment during  us multifamily market fundamentals continued their improvement following the macroeconomic instability experienced in recent years 
occupancy rates and effective rents appear to have increased based upon increased rental market demand  both of which aid loan performance due to their importance to the cash flows of the underlying properties 
despite this improvement in some market fundamentals  recovery of the overall real estate market continues to be challenged by the slow recovery of the broader economy 
the commercial real estate sector began with strong funding levels from insurance companies and cmbs issuers  which surpassed origination totals before the end of the second quarter  however in the second half of the year  cmbs originations declined significantly as treasury yields and consumer confidence decreased 
the passage of dodd frank introduced complex  comprehensive legislation into the financial and real estate recoveries  which will have far reaching effects on the industry and its participants 
while we are not a banking institution  there is uncertainty as to how  in the coming years  dodd frank may affect us or our competitors 
in addition  the scope  extent and timing of gse reform continues to be uncertain 
although we cannot predict what actions congress or other governmental agencies may take affecting the gses and or hud  we expect some regulatory change is likely 
in the interim  the gses and hud continue to supply a significant level of capital to the multifamily market and are expected to do so again in as commercial and multifamily debt refinancing activity is expected to increase 

table of contents factors that may impact our operating results we believe that our results are affected by a number of factors  including the items discussed below 
performance of multifamily and other commercial real estate related markets 
our business is dependent on the general demand for  and value of  commercial real estate and related services  which are sensitive to economic conditions 
demand for multifamily and other commercial real estate generally increases during stronger economic environments  resulting in increased property values  transaction volumes and loan origination volumes 
during weaker economic environments  multifamily and other commercial real estate may experience higher property vacancies  lower demand and reduced values 
these conditions can result in lower property transaction volumes and loan originations  as well as an increased level of servicer advances and losses from our fannie mae dus risk sharing obligations 
the level of losses from fannie mae risk sharing obligations 
under the fannie mae dus program  we share risk of loss on most loans we sell 
in the majority of cases  we absorb the first of any losses on the unpaid principal balance of a loan  and above we share a percentage of the loss with fannie mae  with our maximum loss capped at of the unpaid principal balance of a loan subject to doubling or tripling if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults within months of its sale to fannie mae 
as a result  a continuing rise in delinquencies could have a material adverse effect on us 
the price of loans in the secondary market 
our profitability is determined in part by the price we are paid for the loans we originate 
a component of our origination related revenues is the premium we recognize on the sale of a loan 
stronger investor demand typically results in larger premiums while weaker demand results in little to no premium 
market for servicing commercial real estate loans 
service fee rates for new loans are set at the time we enter into a loan sale commitment based on origination volumes  competition  prepayment rates and any risk sharing obligations we undertake 
changes in future service fee rates impact the value of our future msrs and future servicing revenues  which could impact our profit margins and operating results over time 
revenues gains from mortgage banking activities 
mortgage banking activity income is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the commitment to both originate a loan with a borrower and sell to an investor 
the commitment asset is recognized at fair value  which reflects the fair value of the contractual loan origination related fees and sale premiums  net of co broker fees  the estimated fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan and the estimated fair value of guaranty obligations to be retained 
also included in gains from mortgage banking activities are changes to the fair value of loan commitments  forward sale commitments  and loans held for sale that occur during their respective holding periods 
upon sale of the loans  no gains or losses are recognized as such loans are recorded at fair value during their holding periods 
mortgage servicing rights and guaranty obligations are recognized as assets or liabilities  respectively  upon the sale of the loans 
loans originated in a brokerage capacity tend to have lower origination fees because they often require less time to execute  there is more competition for brokerage assignments and because the borrower will also have to pay an origination fee to the ultimate institutional lender 
premiums received on the sale of a loan result when a loan is sold to an investor for more than its face value 
there are various reasons investors may pay a premium when purchasing a loan 
for example  the fixed rate on the loan may be higher than the rate of return required by an investor or 
table of contents the characteristics of a particular loan may be desirable to an investor 
we do not receive premiums on loans originated in a brokerage capacity  unless we are the lender 
msrs are recorded at fair value the day we sell a loan 
the fair value is based on estimates of future net cash flows associated with the servicing rights 
the estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the msr over the estimated life of the loan 
servicing fees 
we service nearly all loans we originate 
we earn servicing fees for performing certain loan servicing functions  such as processing loans  tax and insurance payments and managing escrow balances 
servicing also includes asset management functions  such as monitoring the physical condition of the property  analyzing the financial condition and liquidity of the borrower and performing loss mitigation activities as directed by the gses and hud 
our servicing fees on loans we originate provide a stable revenue stream 
they are based on contractual terms  are earned over the life of the loan and are generally not subject to prepayment risk 
our fannie mae and freddie mac servicing engagements provide for make whole payments in the event of a voluntary prepayment 
accordingly  we currently do not hedge our servicing portfolio for prepayment risk 
any make whole payments received are included in other income 
hud has the right to terminate our current servicing engagements for cause 
in addition to termination for cause  fannie mae and freddie mac may terminate our servicing engagements without cause by paying a termination fee 
our institutional investors typically may terminate our servicing engagements at any time with or without cause  without paying a termination fee 
net warehouse interest income 
we earn net interest income on loans funded through borrowings from our warehouse facilities from the time the loan is closed until the loan is sold pursuant to the loan purchase agreement 
each borrowing on a warehouse line relates to a specific loan for which we have already secured a loan sale commitment with an investor 
because of this matched funding  we do not incur warehouse interest expense without earning warehouse interest income 
related interest expense from the warehouse loan funding is netted  in our financial statements  against interest income 
net warehouse interest income varies based on the period of time between the loan closing and the sale of the loan to the investor  the size of the average balance of the loans held for sale  and the net interest spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing 
loans typically remain in the warehouse facility for up to days 
loans that we broker for institutional investors and other investors are funded directly by them 
escrow earnings and other interest income 
we earn interest income on property level escrow deposits in our servicing portfolio  generally based on an average day libor plus a spread 
escrow earnings reflect interest income net of interest paid to the borrower  which generally equals a money market rate 
other 
other income is comprised of investment consulting and related services fees  make whole payments and other miscellaneous revenues related to our mortgage banking operations which are not directly attributable to the origination of a loan 
costs and expenses personnel 
personnel expense includes the cost of employee compensation and benefits  which include fixed and discretionary amounts tied to company and individual performance 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization and depreciation is principally comprised of amortization of our msrs 
the msrs are amortized in proportion to  and over the period that  net servicing income is expected to be received 
we amortize the guaranty obligations evenly over the same period as the associated msrs 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment ratably over their estimated useful lives 

table of contents provision for risk sharing obligations 
the provision for risk sharing obligations is established at the loan level for risk sharing loans when the borrower has defaulted on the loan or we believe it is probable the borrower will default on the loan and a loss has been incurred 
this provision is in addition to the guaranty obligation that is recognized when the loan is sold 
our estimates of value are based on appraisals  broker opinions of value or net operating income and market capitalization rates  whichever we believe is a better estimate of the net disposition value 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include sub servicing costs  facilities costs  travel and entertainment  marketing costs  professional fees  licenses  dues and subscriptions  corporate insurance and other administrative expenses 
as a result of the completion of our initial public offering in december  we became a public company and our costs for items such as board fees  legal services  insurance  accounting services and investor relations have increased relative to our historical costs for such services as a private company 
we expect to incur additional costs to maintain compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and the rules and regulations of the us securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange 
income tax expense 
our predecessor entities historically operated as pass through tax entities partnerships  llcs and s corporations 
accordingly  our historical earnings have resulted in only nominal federal and state corporate level expense 
the tax liability has been the obligation of our owners 
upon closing of our initial public offering on december   our tax status changed to a c corporation and our income became subject to both federal and state corporate tax 
as a result of the formation transaction and change in tax status  we recognized net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding deferred tax expense in the fourth quarter of we recognized income tax expense for the days following the formation transaction  and our combined effective federal and state tax rate for its income during those days was 
in  our combined effective federal and state tax rate was 
results of operations following is a discussion of our results of operation for years ended december    and the financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
our business is not typically subject to seasonal trends 
however  our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future  reflecting the interest rate environment  the volume of transactions and

our total expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a increase 
our operating margins were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increases in revenues and earnings were primarily attributable to significantly higher overall origination volumes  while fees as a percentage of loan origination volume decreased slightly 
in addition  substantial increases in servicing fee and other revenues contributed to the overall revenue growth and our operating margin 
the growth in expenses was primarily attributable to increases in personnel expense and amortization and depreciation  both due to our increased loan origination volumes  as well as increased professional costs associated with being a public company  however  in our provision for risk sharing obligations decreased on continued strong performance of loans in our at risk servicing portfolio as underlying real estate fundamentals continued to improve in our net income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our income was reduced by income tax expense of million  of which million relates to the recognition of temporary differences between book and taxable income upon the completion of our formation transaction  and million relates to our income tax expense for the days following the completion of the formation transaction 
pro forma net income for was computed as if our income had been taxed at the corporate level at a composite rate of  rather than at the individual investor level for the pass through entities

in  net income increased when compared to pro forma net income for revenues gains from mortgage banking activities 
gains from mortgage banking activities were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a increase 
gains reflect the fair value of loan origination fees  premiums or losses on the sale of loans  net of any co broker fees  and the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan  net of any guaranty obligations retained 
loan origination related fees were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in origination volumes  offset by a slight decrease in origination related fees as a percentage of loan volume and a shift in product mix to a higher relative proportion of non gse and hud originations  which typically have lower origination related fees 
origination volumes increased to billion in  compared to billion in  a increase

table of contents of the loan as a percentage of origination volumes  was basis points in  compared to basis points in the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan  as a percentage of those gse and hud loans for which we recognize the associated revenues  increased to basis points in  from basis points in  due to the increased servicing fee rates received on loans in servicing fees 
servicing fees were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the servicing portfolio to billion at december  from billion at december   coupled with an increase in the weighted average servicing fee rate to basis points at december  from basis points at december   a increase 
the higher weighted average servicing fee reflects a year over year increase in the servicing fee rates received for new gse and hud loans 
net warehouse interest income 
net warehouse interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase is to attributable to a increase in the average outstanding warehouse balance  offset by a basis point  or  decrease in the average net spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing due to the decrease in the market coupon rate over the two periods

other 
other income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase was primarily attributable to certain non routine transactions  coupled with increases in assumption fees  application fees and prepayment penalties on increased new and refinance origination volume when compared to in  a significant portion of the increase in assumption fees resulted from the receipt of a million fee pursuant to the transfer of a credit facility 
a borrower entered into a purchase and sale agreement for properties which served as collateral for a credit facility 
the acquirer sought to assume the loan under similar terms  which required the approval of fannie mae  as lender  and the company  as servicer  for which the company and fannie mae received a fee of million which was divided equally between the two parties 
this fee was subject to the normal commission structure  as with other loan origination fee income 
in addition  we received a break up fee of million associated with an unsuccessful refinancing of a large portfolio of loans upon meeting certain contractual milestones 
there were no similar discrete transactions in expenses personnel 
personnel expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase was primarily 
table of contents attributable to the additional commissions associated with the increased loan origination volume

personnel expense  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in  down from in the decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in other revenues when compared to  much of which are not subject to commissions 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization and depreciation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a increase

the provision for risk sharing obligations was six and eleven basis points of the fannie mae at risk portfolio balances as of december   and  respectively 
the decrease observed in is primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of defaults  remaining unpaid principal balance of defaulting loans and underlying market factors affecting defaults within the at risk portfolio in when compared to the remaining decrease in the provision was attributable to the facts and circumstances surrounding the loans we service  the related borrowers  key principals and underlying collateral 
we regularly monitor our risk sharing obligations on all loans and update our loss estimates as current information is received

this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the servicing portfolio to billion at december  from billion at december   coupled with an increase in the weighted average servicing fee rate to basis points at december  from basis points at december   an increase 
the higher weighted average servicing fee reflects a year over year increase in the servicing fee rate for new fannie mae loans 
net warehouse interest income 
net warehouse interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease 
the decrease is attributed to a basis point  or  decrease in the average net spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing  offset by a increase in the average outstanding warehouse balance

the provision for risk sharing obligations was eleven and four basis points of the fannie mae at risk portfolio balances as of december   and  respectively

this increase was primarily attributable to increases in sub servicing fees paid to third parties resulting from the growth of the servicing portfolio  preferred broker marketing and office expenses associated with increased loan origination activities  offset by a decrease in professional fees 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for was million as a result of changing the company s tax status in december upon closing of the formation transaction 
we recognized approximately million of net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding deferred tax expense in the fourth quarter of we recognized income tax expense of approximately million for the days following the closing of the formation transaction  and the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate for its income during those days is 
there were no income tax charges recognized in due to our predecessor entities pass through tax status 
on a pro forma basis  income tax expense for was million  compared to million in we used a combined effective federal and state tax rate of to estimate our presented pro forma tax expense  as if the company had been a tax paying corporation  for the periods ended december  and in  the company recorded a gain on bargain purchase of million resulting from the column acquisition 
this gain is not considered taxable income  therefore the pro forma income tax expense was calculated based upon income from operations  as reported  of million 
financial condition cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operations are generated from loan sales  servicing fees  escrow earnings  net warehouse interest income and other income  net of loan purchases and operating costs 
our cash flows from operations are impacted by the fees generated by our loan originations  the timing of loan closings and the period of time loans are held for sale in the warehouse 

table of contents cash flow from investing activities we usually lease facilities and equipment for our operations 
however  when necessary and cost effective  we invest cash in property  plant and equipment 
cash flow from financing activities we use our warehouse facilities to fund loan closings 
we believe that our current warehouse facilities are adequate to meet our increasing loan origination needs 
historically we have used long term debt to fund acquisitions 
although historically our excess cash flows from operations have been distributed to owners  we currently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our unrestricted cash balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively  a million increase

in  we amended our term note payable  which has an unpaid principal balance of million at december   from its initial maturity date of october  to october  we also require working capital to satisfy collateral requirements for our fannie mae dus risk sharing obligations and to meet the operational liquidity requirements of fannie mae  freddie mac  hud  ginnie mae and our warehouse facility lenders 
fannie mae has indicated that it will be increasing its collateral requirements for certain loans  see restricted cash and pledged securities 
congress and other governmental authorities have also suggested that lenders will be required to retain on their balance sheet a portion of the loans that they originate  although no regulation has yet been implemented 
in either scenario  we would require additional liquidity to support the increased collateral requirements 
fannie mae has established benchmark standards for capital adequacy  and reserves the right to terminate the company s servicing authority for all or some of the portfolio  if at any time it determines that the company s financial condition is not adequate to support its obligation under the dus agreement 
the company is required to maintain acceptable net worth as defined in the standards  and the company satisfied the requirements as of december  and the net worth requirement is derived primarily from unpaid balances on fannie mae loans and the level of risk sharing 
at december   the net worth requirement was million and the company s net worth was million 
as of december   we were required to maintain at least million of liquid assets to meet our operational liquidity requirements for fannie mae  freddie mac  hud  ginnie mae and our warehouse facility lenders 
as of december   we had operational liquidity of million 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
historically  our cash flows from operations have been sufficient to enable us to meet our short term liquidity needs and other funding requirements 
similarly  we believe that cash flows from operations should be sufficient for us to meet our current obligations for the next months

fannie mae has recently increased its collateral requirements for certain segments of the fannie mae risk sharing portfolio by approximately basis points effective april  the incremental collateral required for existing and new loans will be funded over approximately the next three years  in accordance with fannie mae requirements 
based on our fannie mae portfolio as of december   the additional proposed collateral required by the end of the three year period is expected to be approximately million 
in january  fannie mae notified its multifamily dus lenders that collateral requirements on fannie mae tier ii  iii and iv loans will remain unchanged for however  collateral requirements for existing and new fannie mae tier i loans will increase from basis points to basis points and that level and level loss sharing requirements will increase 
we currently have an insignificant number of loans in our portfolio which will be affected by the announced collateral changes and do not expect it will have a material impact on our future operations  however  future changes to collateral requirements may adversely impact us

use of the at risk portfolio provides for comparability of the full risk sharing and modified risk sharing loans because the provision and allowance for risk sharing obligations are based on the at risk balances of the associated loans 
accordingly  we have presented the key statistics as a percentage of the at risk portfolio 
for example  a million loan with dus risk sharing has the same potential risk exposure as a million loan with full dus risk sharing 
accordingly  if the million loan with dus risk sharing was to default  the company would view the overall loss as a percentage of the at risk balance  or million  to ensure comparability between all risk sharing obligations 
as of december   all of the company s risk sharing obligations that we have settled have been from full risk sharing loans 

table of contents there are loans within our servicing portfolio which are greater than days delinquent  for which no allowance has been recorded 
we do not anticipate recognizing a loss for these loans upon settlement of our risk sharing obligation with fannie mae because our estimate of the value of the underlying collateral is greater than the unpaid principal balance of the associated loan 
fannie mae dus risk sharing obligations are based on a tiered formula 
the risk sharing tiers and amount of the risk sharing obligations we absorb under full risk sharing are provided below 
except as described in the following paragraph  the maximum amount of risk sharing obligations we absorb is of the unpaid principal balance of the loan at the time of default 
risk sharing tier percentage absorbed by us first of unpaid principal balance next of unpaid principal balance losses above of unpaid principal balance maximum lender loss of unpaid principal balance fannie mae can double or triple our risk sharing obligation if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if a loan defaults within months of its sale to fannie mae 
we may request modified risk sharing at the time of origination  which reduces our potential risk sharing obligation from the levels described above 
we use several tools to manage our risk exposure under the fannie mae dus risk sharing program 
these tools include maintaining a strong underwriting and approval process  evaluating and modifying our underwriting criteria given the underlying multifamily housing market fundamentals  limiting our geographic market and borrower exposures and electing the modified risk sharing option under the fannie mae dus program 
we monitor our underwriting criteria in light of changing economic and market conditions 
in when we believed the cmbs issuers relaxed their underwriting criteria  we did not mirror those changes 
furthermore  in we strengthened our underwriting criteria in response to deteriorating market conditions 
we believe these actions reduced our risk exposure under the fannie mae dus risk sharing program  however  these actions also restricted growth in our origination volumes 
we may request modified risk sharing based on such factors as the size of the loan  market conditions and loan pricing 
except for the fannie mae dus loans acquired in the column transaction  which were acquired subject to their existing fannie mae dus risk sharing levels  our current credit management policy is to cap the loan balance subject to full risk sharing at million 
accordingly  we currently elect to use modified risk sharing for loans of more than million in order to limit our maximum loss on any loan to million such exposure would occur in the event that the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss 
a provision for risk sharing obligations is recorded  and the allowance for risk sharing obligations is increased  when it is probable that we have incurred risk sharing obligations 
the provisions historically have been for fannie mae loans with full risk sharing 
the amount of the provision considers our assessment of the likelihood of payment by the borrower  the value of the underlying collateral and the level of risk sharing 
historically  the loss recognition occurs at or before the loan becoming days delinquent 
our estimates of value are determined considering broker opinions and other sources of market value information relevant to underlying property and collateral 
risk sharing obligations are written off against the allowance at final settlement with fannie mae 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of our fannie mae at risk balances were more than days delinquent

table of contents as of december  and december   our allowance for risk sharing obligations was million and million  respectively  or basis points and basis points of the fannie mae at risk balance  respectively 
our risk sharing obligation with fannie mae requires  in the event of delinquency or default  that we advance principal and interest payments to fannie mae on behalf of the borrower 
advances made by us are used to reduce the proceeds required to settle any ultimate loss incurred 
as of december   we have advanced million of principal and interest payments on the loans associated with our million allowance 
accordingly  if the million in estimated losses is ultimately realized  the company would be required to fund an additional million 
as of december   we had advanced million of principal and interest payments on the loans associated with our million allowance at that time
