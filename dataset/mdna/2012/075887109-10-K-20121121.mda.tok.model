item a 
risk factors 
an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties 
the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd s business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 
in recent years  we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions 
further deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products and services  increased competition  downward pressure on the prices for our products  longer sales cycles  and slower adoption of new 
table of contents technologies 
during fiscal year  our revenue growth was adversely affected by conditions in the healthcare industry  including lower healthcare utilization  particularly in the us and western europe  increased pricing pressure for certain products in our medical segment and an uncertain academic research spending environment for high end instruments in our biosciences segment 
we anticipate that these industry conditions will continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these conditions will not adversely affect our ability to do so in the future 
weakening macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers  and there can be no assurances that bd will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future 
we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe  and we may experience similar delays in these and other jurisdictions experiencing liquidity problems 
the continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of economic recovery uncertain  and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
about of our fiscal year revenues were derived from international operations  and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from our international operations in the future 
the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 
 management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations 
any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks 
changes in reimbursement practices of third party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 
our sales depend  in part  on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities  private insurers and other third party payers for the costs of our products 
the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third party payers  which can vary among public and private sources and by country  may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction 
reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies 
legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad  or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers  could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products  which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products 
see third party reimbursement under item business 
federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 
the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca was enacted in march under the ppaca  beginning in  medical device manufacturers  such as bd  will pay a excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices 
we currently estimate that our fiscal excise tax impacting only three quarters for fiscal year will be between million to million 
we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business 
the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals  clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies  and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures 
these factors  in turn  could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure 
it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our products 
other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business 
while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states  the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of bd s products remains uncertain 
efforts to reduce the us federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations 
as part of the budget control act passed in august to extend the federal debt limit and reduce government spending  trillion in automatic spending cuts known as sequestration over the next decade are 
table of contents due to go into effect  beginning in  in the absence of further legislative action 
half of the automatic reductions would come from lowering the caps imposed on non defense discretionary spending and cutting domestic entitlement programs  including reductions in payments to medicare providers 
government research funding could also be impacted as part of any deficit reduction 
any such reductions in government healthcare spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure 
price volatility could adversely affect costs associated with our operations 
our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price volatility in the cost of raw materials  components  freight and energy 
in particular  bd purchases supplies of resins  which are oil based components used in the manufacture of certain products 
any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results 
increases in the price of oil can also increase bd s costs for packaging and transportation 
new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components 
bd s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products  and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 
a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients  healthcare workers and researchers 
the development of these products requires significant research and development  clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors  including bd s ability to innovate  develop and manufacture new products  complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad  or gain and maintain market approval of our products 
in addition  patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product 
there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 
we cannot guarantee that any of bd s strategic acquisitions  investments or alliances will be successful 
as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth  we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances 
such transactions are inherently risky 
the success of any acquisition  investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors  including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business 
there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 
the medical technology industry is very competitive 
the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes  and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features  clinical outcomes  price  services and other factors 
in addition  increasing customer demand for more environmentally friendly products is creating another basis on which bd must compete 
we face this competition from a wide range of companies 
these include large medical device companies  some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do  and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets 
other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well 
in some instances  competitors  including pharmaceutical companies  also offer  or are attempting to develop  alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device 
the development of new or improved products  processes or technologies by other companies such as needle free injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other low cost manufacturing locations is also creating pricing pressure  particularly in developing markets 
some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation 
as a result of this consolidation  competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased 
in addition  group 
table of contents purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers  which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers 
further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 
the international operations of bd s business may subject bd to certain business risks 
the majority of our sales come from our operations outside the united states  and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets  especially in emerging markets 
bd operations outside the united states subject bd to certain risks  including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above  the effects of local economic conditions  changes in foreign regulatory requirements  local product preferences and product requirements  difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing foreign operations  differing labor regulations  changes in tax laws  potential political instability  trade barriers  weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders 
the success of our operations outside the united states will depend  in part  on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to  among other things  our production facilities and distribution networks 
in addition  under the us tax code  we may be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the us in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our us operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions  our effective tax rate may be higher as a result 
reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 
our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  government laboratories and private foundations 
research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions 
a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies  such as the us national institutes of health nih and agencies in other countries 
the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable 
there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods 
the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic conditions and governmental spending reductions 
any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 
a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd s manufacturing operations and related product sales 
bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components 
certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment and components are not available from multiple sources 
in addition  for quality assurance  cost effectiveness and other reasons  bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers 
the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons  including economic conditions as described above 
while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply  no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
in addition  due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers  we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost 
the termination  reduction or interruption in supply of these sole sourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
we have manufacturing sites all over the world 
in some instances  the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants 
weather  natural disasters including pandemics  
table of contents terrorism  political change  failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures  equipment malfunction  environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products 
bd is subject to a number of pending lawsuits 
bd is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits  including purported class action lawsuits for  among other things  alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement  and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future 
a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item legal proceedings 
given the uncertain nature of litigation generally  we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party 
in view of these uncertainties  we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and  to the extent available  excess liability insurance 
any such future charges  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse affect on bd s results of operations and cash flows 
bd is subject to extensive regulation 
bd is subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  by comparable agencies in foreign countries  and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies 
most of bd s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold 
the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions 
the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products 
also  governmental agencies may impose new requirements regarding registration  labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or re register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries 
once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product  there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met 
following the introduction of a product  these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance 
our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices  adverse event reporting  clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production  marketing or sale of our products and result in fines  delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances  closure of manufacturing sites  seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation 
recent changes in enforcement practice by the fda and other agencies have resulted in increased enforcement activity  which increases the compliance risk for bd and other companies in our industry 
product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 
the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks 
manufacturing or design defects  unanticipated use of our products  or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events 
these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries  and could result  in certain cases  in the removal of a product from the market 
a recall could result in significant costs  as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 
personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us 
in some circumstances  such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 
we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 
we are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning erp system 
our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records  record transactions  provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements 
the implementation of the new erp system has required  and will continue to require  the investment of significant financial and human resources 
in 
table of contents addition  we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the new erp system without experiencing difficulties 
any disruptions  delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders  ship products  provide services and customer support  send invoices and track payments  fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 
our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 
many of bd s businesses rely on patent  trademark and other intellectual property assets 
these intellectual property assets  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations  legal challenges or governmental action 
patents attained by competitors  particularly as patents on our products expire  may also adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  competitors may claim that bd products infringe upon their intellectual property  and resolving any intellectual property claim can be costly and time consuming 
the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings  financial condition or cash flows 
breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we rely on information technology systems to process  transmit  and store electronic information in our day to day operations 
our information technology systems have been  and will likely continue to be  subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes  unauthorized access attempts  and cyber or phishing attacks 
if successful  these cyber attacks could compromise our confidential information and disrupt our operations 
cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent  and there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business 
natural disasters  war and other events could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
natural disasters including pandemics  war  terrorism  labor disruptions and international conflicts  and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events  could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and in areas outside of the united states in which we operate 
these events could result in decreased demand for our products  adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities  or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 
we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 
our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees  including people in technical  marketing  sales and research positions 
competition for experienced employees  particularly for persons with specialized skills  can be intense 
bd s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors  including compensation and benefits  work location and work environment 
if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees  our business could be adversely affected

item legal proceedings 
given the uncertain nature of litigation generally  bd is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which bd is a party 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  bd establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters  without considering possible third party recoveries 
in view of the uncertainties discussed below  bd could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and  to the extent available  excess liability insurance 
in the opinion of management  any such future charges  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on bd s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows

all of the antitrust class action lawsuits have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in a multi district litigation in federal court in new jersey 
on april   bd entered into a settlement agreement with the distributor plaintiffs in these actions 
the settlement agreement provides for  among other things  the payment by bd of  in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint  and a dismissal of the case with prejudice  insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims 
the release would not cover potential class members that affirmatively opt out of the settlement or indirect purchaser claims 
on september   the district court denied a motion to approve the settlement agreement  ruling that the hospital plaintiffs  and not the distributor plaintiffs  are the direct purchasers with standing to sue under federal antitrust laws 
on june   the us court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the district court s standing decision and ruled that the distributor plaintiffs  not the hospital plaintiffs  are direct purchasers entitled to pursue damages 
the hospital plaintiffs requested that the ruling be reconsidered  but that request was denied 
the settlement agreement thus remains in effect  subject to certain termination provisions  and must be approved as to fairness by the district court 
the distributor plaintiffs have filed a motion requesting that the settlement agreement be preliminarily approved as fair and reasonable 
certain of the hospital plaintiffs have opposed that motion 
bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these class action matters beyond the  already accrued 
table of contents and changes to the amount already recognized may be required in the future as additional information becomes available

rti alleges that the bd integra tm syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to rti 
in its complaint  rti also alleges that bd engaged in false advertising with respect to certain of bd s safety engineered products in violation of the lanham act  acted to exclude rti from various product markets and to maintain its market share through  among other things  exclusionary contracts in violation of state and federal antitrust laws  and engaged in unfair competition 
in january  the court severed the patent and non patent claims into separate cases  and stayed the non patent claims during the pendency of the patent claims at the trial court level

rti alleges that the bd integra tm syringes infringe another patent licensed exclusively to rti 
rti seeks money damages and injunctive relief 
on august   the court ordered the consolidation of the patent cases 
on november   at a trial of these consolidated cases  the jury rendered a verdict in favor of rti on all but one of its infringement claims  but did not find any willful infringement  and awarded rti  in damages 
on may   the court granted rti s motion for a permanent injunction against the continued sale by bd of its bd integra tm products in their current form  but stayed the injunction for the duration of bd s appeal 
at the same time  the court lifted a stay of rti s non patent claims 
on july   the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the district court judgment that bd s ml bd integra tm products infringed the asserted rti patents and affirmed the district court judgment of infringement against bd s discontinued ml bd integra tm products 
on october   the federal circuit court of appeals denied rti s request for an en banc rehearing 
rti has filed a petition for review with the us supreme court 
the trial on rti s antitrust and false advertising claims has been postponed pending resolution of rti s appeal of the patent ruling 
with respect to rti s antitrust and false advertising claims  bd cannot estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss as there are significant legal and factual issues to be resolved 
these include discovery regarding rti s alleged damages and liability theories  which has not been completed 
each party has filed motions seeking to exclude portions of the other party s expert testimony and to preclude the other party from introducing certain other evidence at trial 
rti s appeal of the appellate court s patent ruling to the us supreme court adds further uncertainty to the possible future outcomes of rti s antitrust and false advertising claims 
in the event that rti ultimately succeeds at trial and subsequent appeals on its antitrust and false advertising claims  any potential loss could be material as rti is seeking to recover substantial damages  including disgorgement of profits and damages under the federal antitrust laws  which are trebled 
bd believes rti s allegations are without merit 
on october   gen probe incorporated gen probe filed a patent infringement action against bd in the us district court for the southern district of california 
the complaint alleges that the bd viper tm and bd viper tm xtr tm systems and bd probetec tm specimen collection products infringe certain us patents of gen probe 
on march   gen probe filed a complaint  also in the us district court for the southern district of california  alleging that the bd max tm instrument infringes gen probe patents 
the patents alleged to be infringed are a subset of the gen probe patents asserted against bd in the october suit 
on june   the court consolidated these cases 
in a decision dated september   the district court for the southern district of california issued a ruling on pre trial summary judgment motions 
the court ruled that some of gen probe s asserted patent claims are infringed  but other claims are not infringed  thus reducing from six to four the number of patents to be contested at the trial and significant defense issues relating to patent invalidity  inequitable conduct and standing  remain to be adjudicated 
gen probe is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses for this matter as there are significant issues to be resolved either prior to  or at  trial  including issues regarding patent invalidity  inequitable conduct and standing  as well as motions seeking to exclude portions of the other party s expert testimony and to preclude the other party from introducing certain other evidence at trial 
bd believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the above mentioned suits pending against bd and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters 

table of contents bd is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
bd is a party to a number of federal proceedings in the united states brought under the comprehensive environment response  compensation and liability act  also known as superfund  and similar state laws 
the affected sites are in varying stages of development 
in some instances  the remedy has been completed  while in others  environmental studies are commencing

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial review company overview description of the company and business segments becton  dickinson and company bd is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development  manufacture and sale of medical devices  instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions  life science researchers  clinical laboratories  the pharmaceutical industry and the general public 
our business consists of three worldwide business segments bd medical medical  bd diagnostics diagnostics and bd biosciences biosciences 
our products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end users by bd and independent sales representatives 
references to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years  which end on september strategic objectives bd remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value  while making appropriate investments for the future 
bd management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies to increase revenue growth by focusing on our core products that deliver greater benefits to patients  healthcare workers and researchers  to increase investment in research and development for platform extensions and innovative new products  to make significant investments in growing our operations in emerging markets  to improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity  to drive an efficient capital structure and strong shareholder returns 
our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences enabling safer  simpler and more effective parenteral drug delivery  improving clinical outcomes through new  accurate and faster diagnostics  providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitates the understanding of the cell  cellular diagnostics and cell therapy  enhancing disease management in diabetes  women s health and cancer  and infection control 
we continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles to maintain an investment grade rating  to ensure access to the debt market for strategic opportunities  to optimize the cost of capital based on market conditions 
in assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as bd s financial condition and operating performance  management generally reviews quarterly forecast data  monthly actual results  segment sales and other similar information 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial data  including gross profit margin  selling and administrative expense  investment in research and development  return on invested capital  and cash flows 
summary of financial results worldwide revenues in of billion increased from the prior year and reflected estimated volume increases of  which included growth from acquisitions of  partially offset by estimated unfavorable foreign exchange translation of  and estimated price decreases of
