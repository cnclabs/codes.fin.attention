item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december   and free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  as shown on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations  make investments  fund acquisitions and for certain other activities 
free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income  net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets  we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash flows from operating activities 
during the years ended december   and  free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities and in purchases of property and equipment as shown in the net cash flows from operating activities and net cash flows from investing sections  respectively  of our consolidated statements of cash flows included herein 
operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods  since these changes depend upon  among other things  management s timing of payments and control of inventory levels  and cash receipts 
in addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities  free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon  among other things  subscriber growth  subscriber revenue  subscriber churn  subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs  operating efficiencies  increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment  and other factors 
the following table reconciles free cash flow to net cash flows from operating activities 
for the years ended december  in thousands free cash flow add back purchases of property and equipment net cash flows from operating activities the increase in free cash flow from to of million resulted from an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of million and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of million 
the increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash resulting from net income  adjusted to exclude non cash changes in deferred tax expense benefit  and depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities is principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments and million in payments for the tivo and retailer class action settlements 
the decrease in purchases of property and equipment in was primarily attributable to a decrease in satellite construction and a decline in expenditures for equipment under our lease programs for new and existing subscribers of million 
on december   the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of was enacted  which provides for a bonus depreciation deduction of of the cost of our qualified capital expenditures from september  through december  during the year ended december   our deferred income tax expense benefit recorded as a non cash adjustment to net income on our consolidated statements of cash flows increased million compared to the same period in this change is primarily associated with equipment related temporary differences as a result of bonus depreciation deductions available in

the decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities is principally attributable to the increase in inventory and timing differences between book expense and cash payments  primarily related to income taxes and litigation expense 
the increase in purchases of property and equipment in was primarily attributable to the assignment of certain rights under a launch contract for echostar xv and an increase in expenditures for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers 
cash flows from operating activities 
we typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows from operating activities of billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
see discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in free cash flow above 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  acquisitions  strategic investments and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  capital expenditures for new and existing customer equipment totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of billion primarily resulted from our investment in dbsd north america of billion  the terrestar transaction of billion  the blockbuster acquisition of million  net of million cash received  and the sprint settlement agreement net payment of million which were partially offset by a net increase in sales of marketable investment securities of billion and a decline in capital expenditures of million 
the decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of billion primarily resulted from a net decrease in purchases of marketable investment securities  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures including the assignment of certain rights under a launch contract from echostar 
cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt  cash used for the repurchase  redemption or payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations  dividends paid on our class a and class b common stock and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the year ended december   we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of million

other liquidity items subscriber base dish lost approximately  net subscribers during the year ended december   compared to a gain of approximately  net new subscribers during the same period in the change versus the prior year 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued primarily resulted from a decline in gross new subscriber activations 
our gross new subscriber activations for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in see results of operations above for further discussion 
there are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at any given point in time  including subscriber churn and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers 
as we lose subscribers from our existing base  the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced 
satellites operation of our subscription television service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer 
moreover  current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming  particularly by expanding local hd coverage and offering more national hd channels 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity 
security systems increases in theft of our signal or our competitors signals could  in addition to reducing new subscriber activations  also cause subscriber churn to increase 
we use security access devices in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content 
our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures  such as security access device replacement programs and updates in security software  that are intended to make signal theft more difficult 
it has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft 
during  we completed the replacement of our security access devices and re secured our system 
we expect additional future replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system s security is compromised 
stock repurchases our board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our class a common stock 
on november   our board of directors extended the plan and authorized an increase in the maximum dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the plan  such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding shares of our class a common stock through and including december  as of december   we may repurchase up to billion under this plan 
the following table provides information regarding repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the years ended december  class a common stock repurchases in thousands total number of shares repurchased dollar value of shares repurchased subscriber acquisition and retention costs we incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers  including advertising  retailer incentives  equipment subsidies  installation services  and new customer promotions 
while we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription  there can be no assurance that we will 
we employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements and we strive to provide outstanding customer service  to increase the likelihood of customers 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued keeping their dish service over longer periods of time 
our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period 
we incur significant costs to retain our existing customers  mostly by upgrading their equipment to hd and dvr receivers 
as with our subscriber acquisition costs  our retention spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services 
in certain circumstances  we also offer free programming and or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a commitment to receive service for a minimum term 
a component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move 
our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period 
covenants and restrictions related to our senior notes the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  impose limitations on the ability of dish dbs corporation ddbs and its restricted subsidiaries to i incur additional indebtedness  ii enter into sale and leaseback transactions  iii pay dividends or make distributions on ddbs capital stock or repurchase ddbs capital stock  iv make certain investments  v create liens  vi enter into certain transactions with affiliates  vii merge or consolidate with another company  and viii transfer or sell assets 
should we fail to comply with these covenants  all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes could become immediately payable 
the senior notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change in control events occur 
as of the date of filing  ddbs was in compliance with the covenants 
other we are also vulnerable to fraud  particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers 
while we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions  there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud  which could impact our subscriber growth and churn 
sustained economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft and subscriber fraud  which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue 
obligations and future capital requirements contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   future maturities of our long term debt  capital lease and contractual obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period total thereafter in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations interest expense on long term debt and capital lease obligations satellite related obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total in connection with the blockbuster acquisition  we assumed or entered into new leases that had an aggregate commitment of million  included in the table above 
certain of these leases have an early termination right  which is reflected in the future maturity 
in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the table above does not include million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits which were accrued  as discussed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  and are included on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  we do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months 
other than the guarantees disclosed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  we generally do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
satellite related obligations satellites under construction 
as of december   we have agreed to lease capacity on one satellite from echostar that is currently under construction 
future commitments related to this satellite are included in the table above under satellite related obligations 
echostar xvi 
during december  we entered into a ten year transponder service agreement with echostar to lease all of the capacity on echostar xvi  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be launched during the second half of satellite insurance we generally do not have commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we use 
we do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment  digital broadcast operations  satellite and transponder leases  engineering and for products and services related to the operation of dish 
our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
programming contracts in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content 
these programming commitments are not included in the contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements table above 
the terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases 
our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base 
in addition  our margins may face further downward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms 
future capital requirements we expect to fund our future working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations  existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  and cash generated through raising additional capital 
the amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies  depending on  among other things  the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention  including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs 
the majority of our capital expenditures for are driven by the costs associated with subscriber premises equipment  included in our firm purchase obligations  as well as capital expenditures for our satellite 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued related obligations 
these expenditures are necessary to operate and maintain the dish pay tv service 
consequently  we consider them to be non discretionary 
the amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives  including our plans to expand our national hd offerings and other strategic opportunities that may arise from time to time 
our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time  and could increase materially as a result of increased competition  significant satellite failures  or sustained economic weakness 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high yield indebtedness  such as us  to access capital markets at acceptable terms 
these developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position 
spectrum investments in  we paid million to acquire certain mhz wireless licenses  which were granted to us by the fcc in february part or all of these licenses may be terminated if the associated fcc build out requirements are not satisfied 
during the first half of  we entered into a transaction to acquire of the equity of reorganized dbsd north america for approximately billion upon dbsd north america s emergence from bankruptcy  which included capital stock and convertible securities of  and certain claims related to  dbsd north america 
in addition  in june  we entered into the terrestar transaction for a purchase price of billion 
we have paid all but million of the purchase price for the terrestar transaction included in the table above  which will be paid upon closing of the terrestar transaction  or upon certain other conditions being met under the asset purchase agreement 
additionally  during the fourth quarter  we and sprint entered into the sprint settlement agreement pursuant to which all disputed issues relating to our acquisition of dbsd north america and the terrestar transaction were resolved between us and sprint  including  but not limited to  issues relating to costs allegedly incurred by sprint to relocate users from the spectrum now licensed to dbsd north america and terrestar 
pursuant to the sprint settlement agreement  we made a net payment of approximately million to sprint 
our ultimate acquisition of of the equity of reorganized dbsd north america and consummation of the terrestar transaction are subject to certain conditions  including approval by the fcc 
under our agreements to acquire dbsd north america and purchase terrestar s assets  we paid substantially all of the purchase price for both transactions prior to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals the fcc with respect to dbsd north america  and the fcc and industry canada with respect to terrestar 
on february   industry canada approved the transfer of the canadian spectrum licenses held by terrestar to us 
if the remaining required approvals are not obtained  subject to certain exceptions  we have the right to require and direct the sale of some or all of the assets of the relevant company to a third party and we would be entitled to the proceeds from such a sale 
these proceeds could  however  be substantially less than amounts we have paid in the respective transactions 
in addition  our consolidated fcc applications for approval of the license transfers from dbsd north america and terrestar were accompanied by requests for waiver of the integrated service requirement  the spare satellite requirement and various technical provisions 
waiver of the integrated service requirement would allow dish to offer single mode terrestrial terminals to customers who do not desire satellite functionality 
the spectrum licenses currently held by dbsd north america and terrestar do not include a waiver of this integrated service requirement 
our integrated service requirement waiver request has been opposed by certain parties  and there can be no assurance that the fcc will approve it 
if our fcc applications and waiver requests are not granted by the fcc  or are granted in a manner that varies from the form we have requested  it could cause the value of these assets to be impaired  potentially requiring us to take significant write downs on these assets 
we assess potential impairments to these assets annually  or more often if indicators of impairment arise  to determine whether an impairment condition may exist 
we use a probability weighted analysis considering estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved and market based data to assess potential impairments 
to the extent we receive these approvals and waivers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these spectrum investments or that we will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these spectrum investments 
we will likely be required to make 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued significant additional investments or partner with others to commercialize these licenses 
because we have not received approval from the fcc  we do not yet know the full costs including any build out requirements associated with complying with regulations applicable to our acquisition of dbsd north america or the terrestar transaction 
depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build out  any such investment or partnership could vary significantly  which may affect the carrying value of our investments and our future financial condition or results of operations 
voom if voom prevails in its breach of contract suit against us  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  voom hd holdings voom filed a lawsuit against us in new york supreme court  alleging breach of contract and other claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain voom hd channels on the dish pay tv service 
at that time  voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement 
the court denied voom s request  finding  among other things  that voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits 
in april  we and voom each filed motions for summary judgment 
voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions 
on november   the court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment  but granting voom s motions for discovery sanctions 
the court s decision provides for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial 
we appealed the grant of voom s motion for discovery sanctions to the new york state supreme court  appellate division  first department 
on february   the appellate court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal 
on january   the appellate court affirmed the order imposing discovery sanctions and precluding our damages expert from testifying at trial 
we are seeking leave to appeal to new york s highest state court  the court of appeals 
a trial date has not been set

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
capitalized satellite receivers 
since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs  we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale 
such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment  which is based on  among other things  management s judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence 
because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate  the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on  among other things  historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions 
changes in estimated useful life may impact depreciation and amortization on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
for example  if we decreased the estimated useful life of our capitalized subscriber equipment by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge in other  net within other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
sustained economic weakness has resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments  including mortgage backed securities mbs and auction rate securities ars 
for certain of these instruments  there is no or limited observable market data 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available 
we make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date  credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for example  as of december   we held million of securities that lack observable market quotes  and a decrease in our estimated fair value of these securities would result in a decrease of the reported amount by approximately million 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
we evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of indefinite lived and long lived assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
among other reasons  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or the market approach 
while our impairment tests in indicated the fair value of our intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts  significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows or market data could result in a write down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of indefinite lived and long lived assets  on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
based on the methodology utilized to test for impairment  a decrease in the estimated future cash flows or market value of comparable assets and or a increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets while all other assumptions remain unchanged would not result in these assets being impaired 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued period 
any such valuation allowance is recorded in either income tax provision benefit  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit on our consolidated balance sheets 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax provision benefit  net  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period to general and administrative expenses or litigation expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
business combinations 
when we acquire a business  we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques  including the market approach  income approach and or cost approach 
the accounting standard for business combinations requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired to be recorded at estimated fair value 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or the market approach 
seasonality historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year  as is typical in the pay tv service industry 
in addition  the first and fourth quarter generally produce a lower churn rate than the second and third quarter 
however  we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures 
backlog we do not have any material backlog of our products

the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
the value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses  however  this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer 
interest rate risk a change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio  however  we normally hold these investments to maturity 
based on our december  current non strategic investment portfolio of billion  a hypothetical change in average interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value due to the limited duration of our investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended december  of 
a change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at different rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
strategic marketable investment securities as of december   we held current strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are held for strategic and financial purposes  are concentrated in several companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
in general  the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
restricted cash and marketable investment securities and noncurrent marketable and other investment securities restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above

noncurrent auction rate and mortgage backed securities as of december   we held investments in ars and mbs of million  which are reported at fair value 
events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for certain of our ars and mbs investments 
as a result  we classify these investments as noncurrent assets as we intend to hold these investments until they recover or mature  and therefore interest rate risk associated with these securities is mitigated 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments

if our fcc applications and waiver requests are not granted by the fcc  or are granted in a manner that varies from the form we have requested  it could cause the value of these assets to be impaired  potentially requiring us to take significant write downs on these assets 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
long term debt as of december   we had long term debt of billion on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately billion using quoted market prices for our publicly traded debt  which constitutes approximately of our debt 
the fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
to the extent interest rates increase  our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
derivative financial instruments from time to time  we speculate using derivative financial instruments  such amounts  however  are typically insignificant
