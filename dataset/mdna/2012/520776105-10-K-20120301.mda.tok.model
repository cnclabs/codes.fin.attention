item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview was a transformational year for lawson as we made substantial progress on strategic initiatives we have identified as critical to our long term success 
these initiatives included replacing our outdated legacy systems with a state of the art erp system  optimizing our distribution network and transforming our sales organization to allow our customers to conduct business with us through multiple channels 
in august  after extensive preparation  we went live with our new erp system 
within hours of the system going live  we were able to pick  pack  and ship orders 
however  certain configuration issues caused delays in our supply chain and fulfillment processes leading to an increase in backorders and complicated our inventory procurement process 
consequently  we experienced a decline in net sales in the second half of we also experienced higher temporary labor  overtime and freight costs as we worked to reduce backorders in a timely manner 
we are making progress resolving many of these issues as we begin to take advantage of the system s capabilities 
the new erp system is designed to provide us with the ability to access reliable  transparent  real time data  allowing us to meet the technology requirements of state of the art distribution and packaging centers 
in november  we entered into a lease for a new  state of the art packaging and distribution center in mccook  illinois 
this new facility will consolidate operations currently performed in our illinois locations 
the new facility is designed to specifically meet our distribution needs and will incorporate upgraded technology and increased space 
we anticipate the combined operations will streamline our distribution logistics and reduce our cost structure 
the facility s close proximity to a major freight hub will provide us more time to process orders and expand our next day delivery capabilities 
in conjunction with closing the des plaines facility  we plan to relocate our corporate headquarters to a location approximately three miles from our current location 
we anticipate these moves will be completed in the second half of our new erp system is also allowing us to make progress on our sales channel transformation initiatives 
we have been investing in the design and development of a new ecommerce website  which we expect to introduce to our customers in the first half of with the launch of our new website  our customers will have access to an integrated sales channel  allowing them to research products and prices and to place orders on a basis 
this improvement should help us capture a portion of our customers unplanned purchases 
also  during  we amended our existing million dollar credit facility  extending the term until october  and improving pricing 
we also amended financial covenants  giving us the flexibility to better implement our strategic initiatives and further invest in our business 
during  we continued to distribute a quarterly cash dividend of per share  representing a dividend yield of based on our december  stock price 
we ended the year with million of cash and no outstanding borrowings 
we believe our existing cash on hand and our untapped credit facility provide us with the capital resources to make the necessary investments to continue the transformation of our business and allow us to pursue future growth opportunities

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities was million in compared to cash provided by operations of million and million in and  respectively 
in  cash was primarily used to support increased levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
the increase in inventory was attributable to erp issues which negatively affected our procurement process and service level to customers 
these issues also led to delays in the collection of our receivables 
we are making progress resolving these issues and anticipate a return to more normalized receivable and inventory levels during in  cash was primarily generated from operating income and proceeds received from the sale of acs and rutland 
in  cash was primarily generated through the streamlining of working capital by reducing excess inventories and increased collection of accounts receivable 
cash from operations was net of million in settlement payments in and  respectively 
cash used to purchase property  plant and equipment was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
purchases included million and million for the new erp system in and  respectively 
our capital outlays also included million towards the construction of our new mccook packaging and distribution center and million related to the redevelopment of our web site 
we received million of proceeds from the sale of our dallas  texas property in and million of proceeds from the sale of our charlotte  north carolina property in our financing activities included dividends paid to stockholders of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and net pay down of our line of credit of million in our amended credit agreement credit agreement provides for a total borrowing capacity of million in the form of a revolving line of credit and letters of credit which expires on october  additionally  we have a one time option  subject to the bank s consent  to increase the maximum borrowing capacity by an additional million  to million 
the applicable interest rate for borrowings under the credit agreement are based on our debt to ebitda ratio as defined and range from libor plus to or prime minus to percent  and is secured by cash  accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit agreement limits our annual dividend distribution to million and  in addition requires us to make other customary representations  warranties and covenants  and to comply with certain financial covenants 
during  the credit agreement was amended replacing the previous debt service coverage ratio as defined with a requirement to meet minimum consolidated ebitda levels as defined on a quarterly basis through the third quarter ended september  the debt service coverage ratio will be reinstituted for the trailing four quarters ended december  at a minimum of to and increases to to for the trailing four quarters ended march  and each quarter thereafter 
additionally  we must comply with a minimum cash plus accounts receivable and inventory to debt ratio and maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
on december   we were in compliance with of all of the financial covenant levels as detailed below september  september  covenant requirement actual minimum ebitda loss  as defined in the amended credit agreement million million minimum cash plus accounts receivable and inventory to debt ratio minimum tangible net worth million million at december   we had no outstanding balance under the revolving line and million of outstanding letters of credit  leaving borrowing availability of million 
we believe that cash provided by operations and the million revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements  strategic initiatives and capital improvements for the upcoming fiscal year 

table of contents contractual obligations contractual obligations  including discontinued operations  on december  that require cash payment over future periods are as follows september  september  september  september  september  dollars in thousands payments due in years ended december  total thereafter operating leases build to suit lease capital leases security bonus plan purchase commitments deferred compensation severance obligation long term incentive plan total contractual cash obligations payments to participants of the security bonus plan are made on a lump sum basis at time of separation from the company 
payouts for known separation dates have been included in the scheduled year of payout  while payouts for unknown separation dates are reflected in the thereafter column 
payments related to the long term incentive plans are subject to increase or decrease based on the future operating performance of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements in  we entered into a year build to suit lease for our new mccook packaging and distribution center which expires in june and includes total future minimum lease payments of million 
we also entered into an year operating lease for our new headquarters which expires in march and includes total future minimum lease payments of million 
as of december   we had total future minimum operating and build to suit lease commitments of million 
we also had contractual commitments to purchase million of product from our suppliers and contractors in critical accounting policies we have disclosed our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following provides supplemental information to these accounting policies as well as information on the accounts requiring more significant estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs as a percent of accounts receivable outstanding 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be revised by a material amount 
at december   our allowance reserve was of our gross accounts receivables outstanding 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance as a percent of our gross accounts receivable would have affected our annual doubtful accounts expense by approximately million 

table of contents inventory reserves inventories consist principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
most of our products are not exposed to the risk of obsolescence due to technology changes 
however  some of our products do have a limited shelf life  and from time to time we add and remove items from our catalogs  brochures or website for marketing and other purposes 
in addition  we carry varying levels of customer specific inventory 
to reduce our inventory to a lower of cost or market value  we record a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical experience and monitoring current inventory activity 
we use estimates to determine the necessity of recording these reserves based on periodic detailed analysis reviews using both qualitative and quantitative factors 
as part of this analysis  we consider several factors including the inventories length of time on hand  historical sales  product shelf life  product life cycle  product classification  and product obsolescence 
in general  depending on product classification  we reserve inventory with low turnover at higher rates than inventory with high turnover 
our policy is to not re value inventory to the original cost basis subsequent to establishing a new cost basis 
at december   our inventory reserve was million  equal to approximately of our total inventory 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance as a percent of total inventory would have affected our cost of goods sold by million 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  the impact of tax planning strategies and the ability to carry back deferred tax assets to offset prior taxable income 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances  including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 
we recognize the benefit of tax positions when a benefit is more likely than not ie  greater than likely to be sustained on its technical merits 
recognized tax benefits are measured at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained  based on cumulative probability  in final settlement of the position 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
goodwill impairment goodwill  all of which is included in our mro segment  is tested annually during the fourth quarter  or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
impairment of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
first the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired  and thus  the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we estimate the fair value of the mro segment using a market approach  which relies on the market value of companies that are engaged in the same line of business 
we also prepare a discounted cash flow dcf analysis based on our operating plan to determine a range of fair values 
the dcf model relies on a number of assumptions that have a significant effect on the resulting fair value calculation and may change in future periods 
estimated future cash flows are affected both by future economic conditions outside the control of management and operating results directly related to management s execution of our business strategy 
our dcf model is also affected by our estimate of a discount rate that is consistent with the weighted average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use 

table of contents we then assess the reasonableness of our estimate of the fair value of the mro segment 
this is done by applying the same valuation methodology and estimates described above to the entire company and reconciling the resulting estimated fair value of the consolidated company to its market capitalization based on the trading range of the company s stock near the measurement date 
currently  the calculated fair value of the mro segment exceeds its carrying value by million and  therefore  is not considered impaired 
changes in the assumptions used in our dcf calculation could have a material effect on the fair value estimate and could change our assessment of impairment 
a hypothetical decrease in the estimated future annual cash flows generated by the mro segment would decrease its estimated fair value by approximately million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease its estimated fair value by approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of our subsidiaries is located and operates in canada using the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
operating results are translated into us dollars when consolidated into our financial statements 
therefore  we are exposed to market risk relating to the change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
a hypothetical change in the canadian foreign currency exchange rate would have affected our net sales by million and net assets by million 
certain compensation awards have been granted to our directors  officers and key employees that are payable in cash  based upon the market price of our common stock 
these awards are re measured each reporting period and the effect of the change in the share price is reflected in our operating results 
a hypothetical change in the price of our common stock on december  would have affected our operating income by million 
a number of our current and past employees have opted to defer a portion of their earned compensation to be paid at a future date 
these individuals have the ability to invest the deferred compensation in one or more portfolios that track the performance of various mutual funds 
as of december   we recorded a million liability equal to the market value amount of the funds owed 
additionally  we have invested funds in life insurance policies on certain executives 
the cash surrender value of the policies is invested in various investment instruments and the million market value of these investment instruments has been recorded as an asset on our financial statements as of december  the change in the market value of the funds supporting our deferred compensation plan and the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is recorded as a component of income and a hypothetical increase or decrease in the investment portfolios of both the cash value of life insurance asset and the deferred compensation liability would have affected our operating loss by million 
we are exposed to market risk relating to increased commodity and energy costs affecting the production costs of our vendors 
these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us and if we are unable to fully pass these costs through to our customers or to modify our activities  the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating profit margins 
on december   we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving line of credit 
however  in future years  operating results may be exposed to the market risk of fluctuations in the variable interest rate charged on our revolving line of credit
