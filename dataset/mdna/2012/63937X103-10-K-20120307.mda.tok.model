the company navidea biopharmaceuticals  inc formerly neoprobe corporation  navidea  the company  or we  a delaware corporation  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of precision diagnostics and radiopharmaceutical agents 
we are currently developing three radiopharmaceutical agent platforms 
the first  lymphoseek tilmanocept  is intended to be used in determining the spread of certain solid tumor cancers into the lymphatic system 
the second  azd  is intended to aid in the imaging and evaluation of patients with signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment such as alzheimer s disease ad 
the third  rigscan tm  is intended to be used during surgery to help surgeons locate occult or metastatic cancer  with a primary focus on colorectal cancer 
all of these drug products are still in development and must be cleared for marketing by the appropriate regulatory bodies before they can be sold in any markets 
executive summary we believe that the future prospects for navidea continue to improve as we make progress in executing our strategic vision to become a leader in precision diagnostics 
our primary development efforts over the last few years have been focused on the development of our two radiopharmaceutical platforms within oncology  lymphoseek and rigscan 
we expect our overall research and development expenditures to continue to be significantly higher during as compared to due to the expansion of our clinical  regulatory  and business development staff and efforts that support the commercialization of lymphoseek  further development of rigscan  and development of additional radiopharmaceutical pipeline product candidates  including our most recent addition  azd the level to which the expenditures rise will depend on the extent to which we are able to execute on these strategic initiatives 
our efforts in and to date in have resulted in the following milestone achievements corporate financial achieved listing of our common stock on the nyse amex stock exchange secured independent analyst coverage from several major brokerage firms appointed dr

i 
e iacft injection  also called altropane  an iodine radiolabeled imaging agent being developed as an aid in the diagnosis of parkinson s disease and movement disorders our outlook excluding the results of our discontinued operations  as discussed below  our operating expenses over the last three years have been focused primarily on support of lymphoseek product development  and to a lesser extent  on efforts to restart active development of rigscan 
in addition  in december  we paid a million up front fee upon execution of a license agreement with astrazeneca for the exclusive worldwide license of azd we spent approximately million  million and million in total on research and development activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
following the sale of the gds business  our entire organization is focused on the development of radiopharmaceutical agents that fulfill our vision of becoming a leader in precision diagnostics 
of the total amounts we have spent on research and development over the last three years  excluding costs related to our internal research and development headcount and our general and administrative staff which we currently do not allocate among the various development programs that we have underway  we incurred out of pocket charges by program as follows development program lymphoseek    azd  rigscan    we expect our drug related development and commercialization expenses to increase significantly in over with respect to lymphoseek  we were notified by fda that the prescription drug user fee act pdufa date for lymphoseek is june  depending on the timing and outcome of the fda regulatory review cycle  we believe that lymphoseek can be commercially launched in the second half of during  we expect to incur additional development expenses related to supporting the nda review of lymphoseek  our preparation to file an maa in the eu  the completion of our neo clinical trial and potentially studies to support lymphoseek in a post commercialization setting and support the other product activities related to the potential marketing registration of lymphoseek in the us and other markets 
in addition  we expect to incur significant costs during to support our business development and commercialization activities surrounding lymphoseek 
following the licensing of azd  we expect to incur significant expenses during related to preparing for the commencement of additional phase clinical trials in and preparing for a pivotal phase clinical trial in  as well costs for manufacturing related activities required prior to filing for regulatory clearance to market 
azd is currently not expected to contribute any revenue to the company until we are also moving forward with manufacturing activities to support further development of rigscan 
we believe that we may still be technically able to complete the necessary manufacturing steps to permit active clinical development of rigscan by the end of  however  as management continues to assess the scope and required resources for the rigs program  particularly in light of other development opportunities such as for azd and our option to license 
i 
e iacft  the timing and scope of our development and commercialization plan for rigscan may be affected 
we continue to believe it may be advantageous for us to identify a development partner for rigscan 
we have engaged in discussions with various parties over the past few years regarding potential partnerships and or other development arrangements 
however  even if we are able to make such arrangements on satisfactory terms  we believe that the time required for continued development  regulatory approval and commercialization of a rigs product would likely be a minimum of five years before we receive any significant product related royalties or revenues 
finally  if we choose to exercise our option to license 
i 
e iacft injection and are successful in completing a definitive license  or if we are successful in identifying and securing additional product candidates to augment our product development pipeline  we will likely incur significant additional expenses related to furthering the development of such products 
discontinued operations from our inception through august  we developed and marketed a line of medical devices  the neoprobe gds gamma detection systems the gds business

we have not received significant expressions of interest in the cardiosonix business  however  we are obligated to continue to service and support the cardiosonix devices through as such  while we continue to wind down our activities in this area  we expect to continue to generate minimal revenues and incur minimal expenses related to our blood flow measurement device business until a final shutdown of operations or a sale of the business unit is completed

in exchange for transferring the liability related to the extended warranty contracts  which was previously recorded as deferred revenue  we made a cash payment to devicor of  our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations have been reclassified  as required  for all periods presented to reflect the gds business as a discontinued operation 
cash flows associated with the operation of the gds business have been combined within operating  investing and financing cash flows  as appropriate  in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the asset sale will allow us to focus our resources and efforts on the continued development of our radiopharmaceutical products  and to pursue efforts to expand our drug development portfolio 
in december  we executed a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with hercules technology ii  lp hercules  providing for loans to the company in two advances totaling million 
pursuant to the loan agreement  we issued hercules a secured term promissory note in the principal amount of  the first advance  bearing interest at the greater of either a the us prime rate as reported in the wall street journal plus  or b effective interest rate at december  was  and a series gg warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  expiring in december the series gg warrant 
additionally  pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement  if fda approval of lymphoseek occurs on or before june   navidea has the option to draw a second advance in the principal amount of  the second advance  bearing interest at the same rate and payable on the same terms as the first advance 
the loan agreement provides for an interest only period beginning on december  and expiring on july   provided the interest only period shall expire on january  upon navidea s receipt of fda approval for lymphoseek on or before june  the principal and interest is to be repaid in equal monthly installments  payable on the first of each month following the expiration of the interest only period 
the outstanding balance of the debt is due december   or june  if the interest only period is extended following fda approval of lymphoseek 
navidea has the option to pay up to million of the principal amount of the debt in stock at a fixed conversion price of  subject to certain conditions 
in addition  hercules has the option to elect payment for up to another million of the principal amount of the debt by conversion at a fixed conversion price of 
the debt is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the company s assets except for intellectual property  as to which the security interest is in rights to income or proceeds from the sale or licensing thereof 
the loan agreement also specifies certain covenants including the requirement that navidea provide certain information  such as financial statements and budgets  on a periodic basis 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to complete the development and commercialization of new products  our ability to achieve market acceptance of our products  our ability to monetize our investment in non core technologies  our ability to obtain milestone or development funds from potential development and distribution partners  regulatory actions by fda and international regulatory bodies  the ability to procure additional pipeline development opportunities  and intellectual property protection 
our most significant near term development priority is to continue our regulatory and pre commercialization activities related to lymphoseek 
we expect lymphoseek related research and development expenditures to start to decline now that the nda is under review by the fda  however  we expect expenses related to lymphoseek to increase in preparation for the commercial launch 
we continue to assess timelines and development costs for development of azd and rigscan 
we are also actively evaluating a number of different product licensing and or acquisition opportunities  including 
i 
e iacft injection  also called altropane  an iodine radiolabeled imaging agent being developed as an aid in the diagnosis of parkinson s disease and movement disorders for which we executed a license option agreement in january additional costs related to completing the license and subsequent development expenditures related to 
i 
e iacft or some of the other late stage radiopharmaceutical candidates we are evaluating  coupled with development costs related to our existing product candidates  may result in the use of a material portion of our available funds 
we believe we have adequate financial resources  when considered with the flexibility of our development plans and anticipated cash flow following the commercialization of lymphoseek  to permit us to fund some level of pipeline acquisition  licensing and development opportunities 
however  we cannot assure you that lymphoseek will achieve fda approval  or if approved  that it will generate our expected levels of sales and cash flow 
if lymphoseek is not approved  or its approval is delayed  we may need to revise our operating and development plans 
we filed a shelf registration statement in to provide us with future funding alternatives and flexibility as we evaluate our strategic goals and plans for expansion of our product pipeline  although we have not decided whether  when or how much capital might be raised under the registration statement 
even if we decide to attempt to raise additional capital  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to gain access and or be able to execute on securing new development opportunities  successfully obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize new products  achieve significant product revenues from our products  or achieve or sustain profitability in the future

recent accounting developments in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb and international accounting standards board iasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu created a uniform framework for applying fair value measurement principles for companies around the world and clarified existing guidance in us gaap 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and shall be applied prospectively 
we do not expect asu to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  however  it may result in additional disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  as amended by asu no 
 comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
the asus increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income oci by eliminating the option to present oci as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments require companies to present all non owner changes in stockholders equity  either as one continuous statement or as two separate but consecutive statements 
the asus do not change the current option for presenting components of oci gross of the effect of income taxes  provided that such tax effects are presented in the statement in which oci is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
additionally  the standard does not affect the calculation or reporting of earnings per share 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted the provisions of asu early which only impacted the presentation on the statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
asu also impacts presentation in the financial statements and will have no effect on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our results of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition 
we currently generate revenue primarily from grants to support various product development initiatives 
we generally recognize grant revenue when expenses reimbursable under the grants have been incurred and payments under the grants become contractually due 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing  known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management may make significant estimates in the following areas stock based compensation 
stock based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options and restricted stock  are recognized in the statements of operations based on their estimated fair values on the date of grant 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model to value share based payments 
compensation cost arising from stock based awards is recognized as expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
our valuation reflects our estimates of excess and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value 
write offs are recorded when product is removed from saleable inventory 
we review inventory on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on several factors  including current assessment of future product demand  anticipated release of new products into the market and product expiration 
our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  regulations regarding use and shelf life  product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory 
fair value of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments embedded in contracts  to the extent not already a free standing contract  are bifurcated and accounted for separately 
all derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in accordance with current accounting guidelines for such complex financial instruments 
the fair value of warrant liabilities is determined based on a black scholes option pricing model calculation 
unrealized gains and losses on the derivatives are classified in other expenses as a change in derivative liabilities in the statements of operations 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging of market risks or for trading or speculative purposes 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total and after capital lease obligation    operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations a   principal and interest on long term debt   total contractual cash obligations   a this amount represents purchases under binding purchase orders for which we are required to take delivery of the product under the terms of the underlying supply agreement going out approximately six months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
as of december   our million in cash was primarily invested in interest bearing money market accounts 
we believe that a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure related to our assets as the majority are denominated in us currency and our foreign currency based transaction exchange risk is not material 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded approximately   and  of foreign currency transaction losses  respectively 
equity price risk 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging of market risks or for trading or speculative purposes 
derivative instruments embedded in contracts  to the extent not already a free standing contract  are bifurcated and accounted for separately 
all derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in accordance with current accounting guidelines for such complex financial instruments 
the fair value of warrant liabilities is determined based on a black scholes option pricing model calculation which includes the price of company stock 
as of december   we had approximately  of derivative liabilities recorded on our balance sheet related to  of our series v warrants and  of our series gg warrants 
a hypothetical increase in our stock price would increase the value of our derivative liabilities by approximately  a hypothetical decrease in our stock price would decrease the value of our derivative liabilities by approximately
