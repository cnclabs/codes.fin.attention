item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research  design  development  manufacture  integration  and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products 
we also provide a broad range of management  engineering  technical  scientific  logistic  and information services 
we serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense  civil  and commercial applications  with our principal customers being agencies of the us government 
in  of our billion in net sales were from the us government  either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor including from the department of defense dod  were from international customers including foreign military sales fms funded  in whole or in part  by the us government  and were from us commercial and other customers 
our main areas of focus are in defense  space  intelligence  homeland security  and information technology  including cyber security 
we have four business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  information systems global solutions is gs  and space systems 
we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
we are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the global security environment  as well as continuing economic pressures in the us and globally 
a significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on core program execution  improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services  and placing more security capability into the hands of our customers at affordable prices 
recognizing that our us government customers are resource constrained  we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio in a disciplined manner with a focus on international and adjacent markets 
finally  we are focused on cost reduction  through actions such as our workforce reductions in and programs like our voluntary executive separation program vesp and facility reduction initiatives in  to further enhance the value of our products and services 
we expect a slight decline in our consolidated net sales and segment operating profit as compared to  as our customers prepare to meet new security challenges without the benefit of increased resources 
our segment operating margin is expected to remain above 
despite the challenges we face  we have a strong balance sheet and we expect to generate strong operating cash flows  which will allow us to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers  invest in our people so that we have the professional and leadership skills necessary to be successful in this environment  and to return at least of free cash flow to investors in the form of share repurchases and dividends 
industry considerations us government business budget priorities the us government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending  tax  and other initiatives to stimulate the economy  create jobs  and reduce the deficit 
the administration is attempting to balance decisions regarding defense  homeland security  and other federal spending priorities in a greatly constrained fiscal environment imposed by the enactment of the budget control act of budget act  which reduces defense spending by billion over a ten year period starting in fiscal year absent a significant redress of the structural disconnect between revenues and expenditures that can only be addressed through major tax and mandatory spending program reforms  it is likely that discretionary spending by the federal government will remain constrained for several years 
although some specific priorities and initiatives may change from year to year  the investments and acquisitions we have made have been focused on aligning our businesses to address what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas 
the possibility remains  however  that one or more of our programs could be reduced  extended  or terminated as a result of the administration s continuing assessment of priorities 
notably  should congress and the administration fail to change or delay a pending sequestration of appropriations in fiscal year imposed by the budget act  our customers could see their budgets we define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  less the amount identified as expenditures for property  plant and equipment and capitalized internal use software as presented on our statements of cash flows 

table of contents dramatically reduced across the board in january with an attendant impact upon procurement of products and services 
while the impact of sequestration is yet to be determined  automatic across the board budget cuts would approximately double the amount of the ten year billion top line reduction already reflected in the defense funding over a ten year period  with a billion reduction occurring in the government s fiscal year the resulting automatic across the board budget cuts in sequestration would have significant consequences to our business and industry 
there would be disruption of ongoing programs and initiatives  facilities closures and personnel reductions that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise  and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge  directly undermining a key provision of the new security strategy  which is to preserve the industrial base 
the administration s spending priorities were released on february  with the submission of the president s budget request for fiscal year the government s fiscal year runs from october to september every year  congress must approve or revise the proposals contained in the president s annual budget request through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation  which then require final presidential approval 
the outcome of the federal budget process has a direct effect on our business 
department of defense business the passage of the budget act signaled the end of ten years of growth in the dod base budget and imposed specific caps on security and non security spending beginning in fiscal year the fiscal year request of billion for the dod base budget is the first to reflect the reduced spending levels imposed by the budget act and is consistent with its caps on discretionary spending 
the fiscal year request represents a decline of about below the fiscal year dod baseline appropriated level of billion 
preliminary insights into national security funding priorities for fiscal year and beyond were revealed on january  by secretary of defense leon panetta  which were consistent with the fiscal year budget request 
specifically  the defense spending proposal estimates dod base budgets that are essentially flat in real terms from fiscal year through fiscal year in prior years  the administration has requested and congress has provided funds for us military operations in afghanistan and iraq  and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations  through a separate overseas contingency operations oco funding outside of the base dod budget 
the oco funding for fiscal year totaled billion  and the administration has requested billion for fiscal year this significant reduction reflects the completion of us military operations in iraq in our net sales historically have not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding requests  and therefore  we continue to focus our attention on the dod s base budget for support and funding of our programs 
in december  congress passed an omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year to finance all us government activities through september   the end of its fiscal year 
this full year method of financing eliminated much of the uncertainty and inefficiency in procurement of products and services that characterized the first quarter of the government s fiscal year when the operations of the federal government were financed through a series of continuing resolution temporary funding measures 
as we begin  presidential election year activities will likely mean a shortened session for congress that will have to address the annual spending bills but also broader and more contentious policy issues associated with sequestration and tax policy 
given the complexity and sensitivity of these issues  congress may resort to returning for a lame duck session after the november elections in order to deal with these more contentious issues 
the fiscal year budget proposal reflects the administration s new national security strategy and is consistent with the lower spending levels imposed by the budget act 
despite the reduced defense spending levels in the president s fiscal year budget proposal  we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continue to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the dod and our programs are well supported in the fiscal year budget request 
this view was strongly supported by the secretary of defense s initial public release of elements of the fiscal year defense budget request on january  for example  the budget supports continuation of all three variants of the f and still maintains the same ultimate inventory objective of  aircraft for the us government as last year  although ramp up of production will be slowed due to budgetary constraints in the near term to allow for more testing and to minimize design changes impacting production aircraft 
additionally  the secretary s preliminary release specifically cited continued support for systems where we are the prime contractor or a major subcontractor such as the global positioning satellite program  the advanced extremely high frequency system  the space based infrared system  phased adaptive approach missile defense system  ddg aegis destroyer  and continued operation of the u manned isr aircraft 

table of contents given the administration s emphasis on affordability and the need to find further efficiencies in the management and operations of dod  the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment  expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions  and vastly improved levels of network and cyber security  all appear to continue to be national priorities 
to address these priorities  we continue to focus on growing our portfolio in these areas  diversifying our business  and expanding into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels  rotary wing aviation  and land vehicles 
our products are represented in almost every aspect of land  sea  air  and space based missile defense  including the aegis combat system  the patriot advanced capability pac missile program  and the terminal high altitude area defense thaad transportable defensive missile system 
even as future quantities may be adjusted to reflect reduced government resources for defense  we continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions  missile  and other systems  such as hellfire  javelin  guided multiple launch rocket systems  and q formerly eq radar systems  and the persistent threat detection system ptds 
we also have unmanned systems capabilities  including air  ground  and underwater systems 
we have a significant presence in the support and modernization of the dod s information technology systems 
we see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity and cost effectiveness of the systems procured by our customers  and for improving global supply chain management 
non department of defense business our experience in the defense arena  together with our core information technology and services expertise  has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies  including the departments of homeland security  justice  commerce  health and human services  transportation  and energy  the us postal service  the social security administration  the federal aviation administration  the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  and the environmental protection agency epa 
as with the dod  all other departments and agencies were impacted by the budget act 
for fiscal year there is a separate non security discretionary spending cap applied to all non dod entities that were not included under the security cap 
the result would be that budgets for fiscal year and beyond will be reduced further below last year s estimates 
we have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence  knowledge management  and e government solutions for our customers  including the social security administration and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
we also provide program management  business strategy and consulting  complex systems development and maintenance  complete life cycle software support  information assurance  and enterprise solutions 
we believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions in order to reduce costs of operations  but at a slower pace in the near term 
consistent with our dod business  more affordable logistics and sustainment  a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions  and improved levels of network and cyber security all appear to be priorities in our non dod business as well 
homeland security  critical infrastructure protection  and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities 
the continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management  ports  waterways and cargo security  biohazard detection systems for postal equipment  employee identification and credential verification systems  information systems security  and other global security systems solutions 
other business considerations international business we remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers 
we conduct business with foreign governments primarily through aeronautics and electronic systems 
our international sales are comprised of fms through the us government and direct commercial contracts 
in aeronautics  the us government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design  testing  production  and sustainment of the f lightning ii  while other countries such as israel and japan have selected the f as their next generation combat aircraft 
we expect the first international deliveries of the f to begin in the f fighting falcon has been selected by customers worldwide  including recent orders from iraq and oman  with follow on buys from countries 
we continue to expand the c j super hercules air mobility aircraft s international footprint with customers in countries 
in global sustainment  we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer oem for our major platforms and have set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension  including new wings and support for the us  norway  canada  and taiwan s p fleet 

table of contents with regard to the aegis combat system  our electronic systems segment performs activities in the development  production  ship integration and test  and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as japan  spain  korea  norway  and australia 
the system also has been selected to be used as a ground based missile defense system in europe  referred to as aegis ashore 
this segment has contracts with the canadian government for the upgrade and support of combat systems on halifax class frigates 
the new littoral combat ship lcs is also generating interest from potential international customers 
electronic systems also produces the pac missile  an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats  for international customers including japan  germany  the netherlands  taiwan  and the united arab emirates uae 
the uae entered into a fms agreement with the us government for the first international sale of the thaad missile defense system  with other countries having expressed interest 
in  the commonwealth of australia entered into a fms agreement for the first international sale of the mh r helicopter  for which we are responsible for integrating the common cockpit avionics suite  which marks the first ever purchase of an mh r helicopter outside of the us  and we also received an order to upgrade the united kingdom s warrior fighting vehicles 
to the extent our contracts and business arrangements with international partners include operations in foreign countries  other risks are introduced into our business  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries  and the potential for deterioration of political relations 
status of the f program the f program consists of multiple contracts 
under our customer s acquisition strategy  the system development and demonstration sdd contract will be performed concurrently with the low rate initial production lrip contracts 
concurrent performance of development and production contracts is advantageous in complex programs to test airplanes  shorten the time to field systems  and achieve overall cost savings 
accordingly  we are performing the sdd contract concurrently with lrip aircraft lots through the sdd portion of the f program is expected to continue into and has approximately million of fee remaining  only a minor portion of which has been tied to specific performance milestones to date 
any portion of the remaining fee that we or our partners receive will be dependent upon our customer s evaluation of our progress on program milestones  most of which have yet to be determined by our customer 
the current profit booking rate on the sdd contract contemplates that we will earn a portion of these outstanding award fees 
given the size and complexity of the f program  we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft quantities  program schedule  cost  and requirements as part of the dod  congressional  and international partners oversight and budgeting processes 
current program challenges include  but are not limited to  executing flight tests  supplier and partner performance  software development  and receiving funding for the lrip contracts on a timely basis 
in  both of the lrip lot aircraft and seven of the lrip lot aircraft were delivered to the us government 
we received additional funding for lrip and long lead funding for lrip in we now have production aircraft on order 
although not exclusively related to the f program  on october   the defense contracting management agency dcma withdrew its prior validation and determination of compliance of the earned value management system evms at our fort worth  texas location 
evms is a tool for managing cost and schedule performance on complex programs 
we understand that the dcma has chosen to re audit our evms system in the withdrawal of the prior validation and determination of compliance of the evms system has no impact on our internal controls over financial reporting 
in january  the secretary of defense removed the short takeoff and vertical landing stovl fighter variant from probation as the stovl variant completed highly successful initial sea trials aboard the uss wasp and is demonstrating the kind of performance and maturity that is in line with the other two variants of the f international interest in the f continues to grow with two us government fms customers to go along with our eight partner countries 
in  the israeli government signed a letter of offer and acceptance with the us government for the procurement of f aircraft and the japanese ministry of defense selected the f to be its next generation fighter 
israel and japan are expected to be the first two countries to receive the f aircraft through the us government fms process 

table of contents portfolio shaping activities overview we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities  and through acquisition  divestiture  and internal realignment activities 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies 
we have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years 
we also may explore the divestiture of businesses 
in pursuing our business strategy  we routinely conduct discussions  evaluate targets  and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions  divestitures  joint ventures  and equity investments 
as part of our business strategy  we seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services  or customer base  at attractive valuations 
acquisitions and divestitures we used million in for acquisition activities  including the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates 
we have accounted for the acquisition of businesses under the acquisition method  which requires that all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured and recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
acquisitions in primarily include qtc holdings inc qtc  which provides outsourced medical evaluation services to the us government  and sim industries bv  a commercial aviation simulation company 
qtc is included within our is gs business segment  and sim industries bv is included within our electronic systems business segment 
the results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the statement of earnings from the date of acquisition in the fourth quarter 
during  we committed to a plan to sell savi technology  inc savi  and we closed on the sale of pacific architects and engineers  inc pae 
in  we closed on the sale of enterprise integration group eig 
for additional information  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of design  development  and production dd p contracts with varying production delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
all per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a per diluted share basis from continuing operations  unless otherwise noted 
in millions  except per share data operating results a net sales cost of sales operating profit interest expense other non operating income  net income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations net earnings loss from discontinued operations net earnings diluted earnings per common share a continuing operations discontinued operations total a the amounts in the above table reflect  as appropriate  the change in our accounting for services contracts with the us government from the services accounting method to the percentage of completion method note and the operating results of savi as discontinued operations note 
all prior period amounts included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been adjusted to reflect these changes 

table of contents the following provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations by focusing on key elements in our statements of earnings 
product sales are predominantly generated in the aeronautics  electronic systems  and space systems business segments  and most of our services sales are generated in our electronic systems and is gs business segments 
net sales in millions net sales products services total approximately of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
under the poc method  we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract  as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion 
the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the following discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our discussion of business segments  because  due to the nature of poc accounting  changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales 
net sales for were billion  a million or increase over net sales of billion 
the increase was due to a million or increase in product sales and a million or increase in services sales 
net sales for were billion  a billion or increase over net sales of billion 
the increase was due to a million or increase in product sales and a billion or increase in services sales 
product sales product sales at aeronautics increased about billion in compared to primarily due to production activities on the f lrip contracts  volume on c programs including eight additional c j aircraft deliveries  f support activities and deliveries two additional f aircraft deliveries and volume on c programs including one additional c m aircraft delivery partially offset by lower volume on the f program and f sdd contract 
electronic systems product sales increased approximately million in compared to primarily due to production on air defense programs including pac and thaad and the lcs program partially offset by lower volume on certain ship and aviation programs  tactical missile programs including multiple launch rocket system mlrs and joint air to surface standoff missile jassm and fire control programs 
product sales decreased at is gs in compared to by about million primarily due to the absence of the decennial response integration system dris program that supported the us census and a decline in activities on the airborne maritime fixed station joint tactical radio system jtrs program 
product sales at space systems declined about million in compared to primarily due to lower sales on the orion multi purpose crew vehicle orion program and the nasa external tank program  due to the completion of the space shuttle program  partially offset by higher volume on fleet ballistic missile programs and commercial satellites 
product sales at aeronautics increased about billion in compared to primarily due to production volume on the f lrip contracts  activities on c programs including nine additional c j aircraft deliveries  and volume on c programs including one additional c m aircraft delivery partially offset by lower volumes on the f program  f sdd contract and f including fewer f aircraft deliveries program 
electronic systems product sales increased approximately million in compared to primarily due to production on air defense programs including pac and tactical missile programs including hellfire  mlrs  and jassm partially offset by lower sales on various underseas programs 
is gs product sales were relatively unchanged between and as increasing activities on dris were offset by lower activities on many smaller programs 
product sales at space systems decreased about million in compared to primarily due to lower volume on defensive missile systems  activities on the nasa external tank program due to the wind down of the space shuttle program and volume from commercial satellite and launch vehicle activities 
there was one commercial satellite delivery in both and  and there were no commercial launches in compared to one commercial launch in 
table of contents services sales services sales at electronic systems increased about million in compared to primarily due to growth on the special operations forces contractor logistics support services sof clss program partially offset by lower volume on various other logistic and training services programs 
services sales at is gs increased approximately million in compared to due to activities on a number of smaller contracts 
most of our services sales are in the electronic systems and is gs business segments 
services sales at electronic systems increased about million in compared to primarily due to growth on various logistic and training programs and the start of the sof clss program in the third quarter of is gs services sales increased about million in compared to due to activities on the hanford mission support contract and numerous other services contracts at is gs 
cost of sales cost of sales  for both products and services  consist of materials  labor  and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs overhead and general and administrative 
for each of our contracts  we manage the nature and amount of costs at the contract level  which form the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of the contract 
management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit  and not by type or amount of operating expense 
consequently  our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit  consistent with our approach for managing the business 
this approach is consistent with the overall life cycle of our contracts  as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit  and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion 
we regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses 
the cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract 
for example  cost data provided to our customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product such as a wing box on an aircraft or for services  the type of work being performed such as help desk support 
our contracts generally are cost based  which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services 
most of our contracts generally are bid and negotiated with our customers based on the mutual awareness of our estimated costs to provide the product or service 
this approach for negotiating contracts with our us government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs 
we also may enter into long term supply contracts for certain materials or components  to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices 
in millions cost of sales cost of product sales of product sales cost of services sales of services sales severance and other charges other unallocated corporate costs total due to the nature of poc accounting  changes in our cost of product and services sales are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales 
the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and with our discussion of business segments 
cost of sales was billion in  a million or increase over cost of sales of billion 
the increase was due to a million increase in cost of product sales  a million increase in cost of services sales and a million increase in other unallocated corporate costs  partially offset by a reduction in severance and other charges of million as further discussed in the following sections 
cost of sales was billion in  a billion or increase over cost of sales of billion 
the increase was due to a million increase in cost of product sales  a million increase in cost of services sales  a million increase in other unallocated corporate costs and an increase for severance and other charges of million  as further discussed in the following sections 

table of contents cost of product sales cost of product sales at aeronautics increased by about billion in compared to primarily due to production volume on various programs  including f lrip contracts  and the impact of additional aircraft deliveries 
cost of product sales for electronic systems was relatively unchanged between and cost of product sales at is gs decreased about million in compared to primarily due to the absence of the dris program and lower volume on the jtrs program 
cost of product sales decreased at space systems by about million in compared to primarily due to lower volume on the nasa external tank and orion programs 
cost of product sales at aeronautics increased by about billion in compared to primarily due to production activities on various programs  including f lrip contracts  and the impact of aircraft deliveries 
cost of product sales at electronic systems increased about million in compared to primarily due to volume on air defense and tactical missile programs 
is gs cost of product sales were relatively unchanged between and cost of product sales at space systems declined about million in compared to primarily due to lower volume on various programs  including the nasa external tank  and the absence of a commercial launch as compared to the prior year 
the increase in the percentage of cost of product sales relative to product sales in compared to primarily was due to the increased development and initial production work on the f program and less work on mature programs  such as f and f development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs 
cost of services sales cost of services sales at electronic systems increased about million in compared to primarily due to sof clss 
cost of services sales at is gs decreased by about million in compared to primarily due to the retirement of risks during and the recognition of reserves on various programs in the decrease in the percentage of cost of services sales relative to services sales in compared to primarily was due to the retirement risks and other factors on numerous programs at is gs  partially offset by volume on sof clss  which provides a lower margin relative to other electronic systems programs 
most of our services sales are in the electronic systems and is gs business segments 
cost of services sales at electronic systems increased about million in compared to primarily due to volume on various logistics activities  as well as the start of the sof clss program 
is gs cost of services sales increased approximately million in compared to due to volume on various service contracts  including the hanford mission support contract 
most of our services sales are in the electronic systems and is gs business segments 
severance and other charges during  we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling million  net of state tax benefits 
of these severance charges  million and million related to our aeronautics and space systems business segments  and million related to our is gs business segment and corporate headquarters 
these charges reduced our net earnings in by million 
per share 
these severance actions resulted from a strategic review of these businesses and our corporate headquarters to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions 
the workforce reductions at the business segments also reflect changes in program lifecycles  where several of our major programs are transitioning out of development and into production  and certain programs are ending 
the charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions 
in  we recorded a charge of million  net of state tax benefits  related to the vesp 
the charge  which included lump sum special payments for qualifying executives  reduced our net earnings by million 
per share 
the amounts of the vesp attributable to our business segments were million at aeronautics  million at electronic systems  million at is gs  and million at space systems 
the remaining million was attributable to our corporate headquarters 
also  in  we recorded a million charge related to our decision to consolidate certain operations within our electronic systems business segment  including the closure of a facility in eagan  minnesota 
this charge reduced our net earnings for by million 
per share 
the majority of the charge was associated with the accrual of severance payments to employees  with the remainder associated with impairment of assets 
we expect to recover a substantial amount of these severance charges  including the charge related to the vesp  in future periods through the pricing of our products and services to the us government and other customers 
while the vesp is expected to be recovered over several years  the other severance charges would typically be expected to be recovered within a one year period 
for example  space systems recovered most of its severance charge in the second half of 
table of contents other unallocated corporate costs other unallocated corporate costs principally includes the non cash fas cas pension adjustment  stock compensation  and other corporate costs 
these costs are not allocated to the business segments and  therefore  are excluded from the costs of product and services sales see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of these items 
the million increase between and primarily was attributable to an increase in the non cash fas cas pension adjustment of million  which included increased fas pension expense in compared to due to the decrease in the discount rate in  together with the effect of the recognition of the investment losses  partially offset by the effects of investment gains in and each as compared to our long term rate of return assumption 
for more information  see the related discussion in critical accounting policies under the caption postretirement benefit plans 
other unallocated corporate costs increased million between and primarily due to fluctuations in expense associated with a number of corporate activities 
changes in our cost of sales between periods were not material  except as described above 
the period over period change in our cost of sales was due to the volume of costs resulting from production  deliveries of products  and or services provided on our portfolio of contracts 
we have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales that would have a material impact on our future operations 
operating profit our operating profit for was billion  essentially unchanged from the increase in the non cash fas cas pension adjustment was offset by increases in operating profit in every business segment  a decrease in severance and other charges  and a decrease in other unallocated corporate costs attributable to various corporate activities 
our operating profit for was billion  a decrease of compared to operating profit of billion in the decline in operating profit of million primarily was attributable to the effects of severance and other charges  net of state tax benefits  of million note 
interest expense interest expense for was million  about the same as in increased interest expense from the billion issuance of long term debt late in the third quarter of partially was offset by the redemption of certain notes in the fourth quarter of interest expense for was million  or million higher than the increase mainly was driven by interest expense on the billion of long term notes issued in the fourth quarter of other non operating income  net other non operating income  net was million in  compared to million in the decrease primarily was due to premiums of million on early extinguishments of debt note and lower net unrealized gains on marketable securities held to fund certain non qualified employee benefit obligations in other non operating income  net was million in  compared to million in the change between periods primarily reflects lower net unrealized gains on marketable securities held to fund certain non qualified employee benefit obligations 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was for  for  and for these rates were lower than the statutory rate of for all periods due to tax benefits for us manufacturing activities  the deduction of dividends related to certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature  and the research and development r d tax credit 
the effective tax rate was affected by the completion by the us congressional joint committee on taxation of its review of irs appeals resolution of certain adjustments related to tax years as a result of completion of the review in april  we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of million in the effective tax rates for and also included additional tax benefits related to us manufacturing activities primarily due to an increase in and qualified production activity income and an increase in the us manufacturing activity deduction rate from to 
table of contents the effective tax rate was affected by the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of  which eliminated the tax deduction for company paid retiree prescription drug expenses to the extent they are reimbursed under medicare part d  beginning in as a result  we recorded additional income tax expense of million in the effective tax rate reflected a reduction of income tax expense of million primarily arising from the resolution of irs examinations of the years through and the administration s recent proposal to lower the corporate tax rate would require us to reduce our deferred tax assets upon enactment of the related tax legislation with a corresponding material  one time increase to income tax expense  however  our income tax expense and payments would be reduced in subsequent years 
net earnings from continuing operations we reported net earnings from continuing operations of billion per share in  billion per share in  and billion per share in both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above 
in addition  earnings per share has benefitted from a significant number of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program  partially offset by common stock issued under our stock based compensation and defined contribution plans 
share repurchases of million  million  and million in   and represented   and of our shares outstanding at the beginning of each year 
net earnings from discontinued operations net earnings from discontinued operations included the operating results of savi for all periods presented 
discontinued operations also included pae for   and through the date of its sale on april   and those of eig for and through the date of its sale on november  we reported a net loss from discontinued operations of million 
per share in  and net earnings from discontinued operations of million 
per share in and million 
per share in net earnings from discontinued operations for included a net benefit of million related to the decision to sell savi  the principal driver of which is the recognition of a deferred tax asset for book and tax basis differences 
a similar tax benefit of million related to the sale of pae was also recorded in net earnings from discontinued operations for included a gain  net of income taxes  of million 
per share from the sale of eig 
additionally  as a result of our decision to sell pae in  we recorded net adjustments that increased earnings from discontinued operations by million

discussion of business segments we operate in four business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  is gs  and space systems 
we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
the following table presents net sales and operating profit of our four business segments 
net sales exclude intersegment revenue  as these activities are eliminated in consolidation 
intercompany transactions are generally negotiated under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts 
operating profit of the business segments includes the equity earnings or losses from investees in which certain of our business segments hold equity interests  because the activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments 
operating profit of the business segments excludes the non cash fas cas pension adjustment discussed below  expense for certain stock based compensation programs  including costs for stock options and restricted stock units  the effects of items not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance  such as the severance charges in and the charges in related to the vesp and facilities consolidation within electronic systems note  gains or losses from divestitures note  the effects of legal settlements  corporate costs not allocated to the business segments  and other miscellaneous corporate activities 
the items other than the charges related to severance  the vesp  and facilities consolidation are included in other unallocated corporate expense  net in the following table which reconciles operating profit from the business segments to operating profit in our statements of earnings 
the charges related to severance  the vesp  and facilities consolidation are presented together as a separate reconciling item 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we realigned an immaterial supply chain services business from our aeronautics business segment to our electronic systems business segment 
the realignment had no effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
the financial information in the following table has been reclassified to reflect this realignment 
in millions net sales aeronautics electronic systems information systems global solutions space systems total operating profit aeronautics electronic systems information systems global solutions space systems total business segments unallocated corporate expense non cash fas cas pension adjustment fas pension expense less cas expense non cash fas cas pension adjustment a severance and other charges stock compensation expense and other  net b total unallocated corporate expense  net total operating profit a fas pension expense increased in compared to  and in compared to  due to the decrease in the discount rate each year  together with the effect of the recognition of investment losses from  partially offset by the effects of investment gains in and each as compared to our long term rate of return assumption 
the segment operating profit includes pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with us government cost accounting standards cas 
the non cash fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with gaap and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas 
the non cash fas cas pension adjustment is expected to be about million in for more information  see the related discussion in critical accounting policies under the caption postretirement benefit plans 
b the change in stock compensation expense and other  net between the periods primarily was due to fluctuations in expense associated with various corporate activities  none individually significant 
the following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment 
total negotiated backlog was approximately billion  billion  and billion at december    and these amounts included both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated 
negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
funded backlog was approximately billion at december  our net sales are derived from long term contracts for dd p activities and for services provided to the us government as well as fms conducted through the us government 
we account for these contracts  as well as dd p contracts with non us government customers  under the poc method of accounting which represent approximately of our net sales 
we derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non us government customers  which we account for under the services method of accounting 
under the poc method of accounting  we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion 
cost reimbursable contracts  which account for the majority of our net sales  provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee 
for fixed priced contracts  net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred 
due to the nature of the poc method of accounting  changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales 

table of contents changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in net sales resulting from varying production activity levels  deliveries  or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes typically include a corresponding change in segment operating profit based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract 
for example  if the cost volume on a cost reimbursement type contract increased or decreased compared with a prior period  sales and operating profit for that contract also will be increased or decreased 
changes in performance refer to increases or decreases in the estimated profit booking rates on our poc contracts and usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated conditions on a particular contract 
for example  improved conditions typically result from the retirement of risks on contracts 
such changes in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such changes 
for example  if we increase the estimated profit booking rate on a cost reimbursable contract  the increase in sales and operating profit for that contract will reflect a higher return on sales in the current period due to the recognition of the higher profit booking rate on both current period costs as well as previously incurred costs 
many of our contracts are multi billion dollar contracts that span several years and include highly complex technical requirements 
at the outset of a contract  we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical  schedule  and costs aspects of the contract  and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract 
the estimates consider the technical requirements for example  a newly developed product versus a mature product  the schedule and associated tasks for example  the number and type of milestone events  and costs for example  material  labor  subcontractor and overhead 
the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements  schedule  and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion 
profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical  schedule and costs aspects of the contract 
all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate 
we have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the us government and cannot be specifically described 
the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results  and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs 
aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research  design  development  manufacture  integration  sustainment  support  and upgrade of advanced military aircraft  including combat and air mobility aircraft  unmanned air vehicles  and related technologies 
aeronautics also provides logistics support  sustainment  and upgrade modification services for its aircraft 
aeronautics major programs include the f lightning ii joint strike fighter  f fighting falcon  f raptor  c j hercules  and the c m super galaxy 
aeronautics operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margin backlog at year end net sales for the aeronautics segment increased billion  or  in compared to the growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about million for work performed on the f lrip contracts as production increased  higher volume of about million for c programs due to an increase in deliveries c j aircraft delivered in compared to during and support activities  about million for f support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries f aircraft delivered in compared to during  and approximately million for higher volume on c programs two c m aircraft delivered in compared to one during 
these increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately million due to lower volume on the f program  which will continue to decline as production winds down with final deliveries expected to be completed in  and lower net sales of about million for the f sdd contract as development work decreased 
net sales for the aeronautics segment increased by billion  or  in compared to the increase primarily was due to additional volume from work performed on the f lrip contracts of approximately billion  higher volume of about million for c programs due to an increase in deliveries c j aircraft delivered in as compared to in and support activities  and higher volume on c programs of about million  including 
table of contents delivery of the first c m 
these increases partially were offset by lower volume of approximately million on the f sdd contract  lower f volume of approximately million primarily due to a reduction of deliveries f deliveries in compared to in  and lower volume on the f program of million as production continued to wind down 
operating profit for the aeronautics segment increased million  or  in compared to the increase primarily was attributable to approximately million of higher operating profit on c programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks  increased volume and risk retirements on f programs of about million and c programs of approximately million  and about million due to risk retirements on other aeronautics sustainment activities in these increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately million on the f program and f sdd contract primarily due to lower volume and about million on other programs  including f lrip  primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in  compared to operating profit for the aeronautics segment decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease primarily was attributable to a decline in operating profit on the f program of about million due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of risk retirements as the production program winds down  lower volume and a decrease in the level of risk retirements of approximately million on the f sdd contract  and a decline in operating profit of about million on the f program due to a reduction of deliveries 
these decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and risk retirements on the f lrip contracts of approximately million 
the decrease in the aeronautics segment s operating margin from to reflects increased development and initial production work on the f program and less work on more mature programs such as the f and f development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs 
accordingly  while net sales increased in relative to  operating profit decreased and consequently operating margins have declined 
backlog increased in compared to mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the f and c programs  which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the c program 
backlog increased in compared to mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the c  f and c programs  which partially were offset by higher sales volume compared to new orders on the f program in we expect that aeronautics net sales in will be comparable with an increase in net sales on the f lrip contracts is expected to be mostly offset by a decline in volume on the f production program due to completion of the production program with the last aircraft delivery in the first half of operating profit is projected to decrease at a low single digit percentage range from levels  resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years 
electronic systems our electronic systems business segment provides surface ship and submarine combat systems  sea based missile defense systems  ship systems integration  littoral combat ships  nuclear instrumentation and control systems for naval submarines  aircraft carriers  and surface warships  air and defense missile systems  air to ground precision strike weapons systems  tactical missiles  munitions  fire control and navigation systems for rotary and fixed wing aircraft  manned and unmanned ground vehicles  mission operations support  readiness  engineering support  and integration services  simulation and training services  and energy programs 
electronic systems major programs include the aegis combat system  pac  thaad  mlrs  hellfire  jassm  apache fire control system  lcs  and sof clss 
we have classified savi as discontinued operations note and  therefore  financial information related to this business has been excluded from the segment information below 
electronic systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margin backlog at year end net sales for the electronic systems segment increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due to higher volume on air defense programs including pac and thaad of about million  logistics activities 
table of contents of about million related to the sof clss program  which began late in the quarter ended september   and the lcs program of approximately million 
these increases partially were offset by a decline in volume of approximately million for certain ship and aviation programs primarily maritime patrol aircraft and ptds  about million for various logistics and training services  and approximately million for tactical missile and fire control programs 
net sales for the electronic systems segment increased by million  or  in compared to contributing to the increases were higher volume of about million on various training and logistics activities including the sof clss program  increased deliveries on tactical missile programs including mlrs and jassm of approximately million  increased volume on various surface naval warfare programs the aegis combat system of about million  and higher volume of about million on air defense programs including pac 
these increases partially were offset by lower volume of approximately million on undersea warfare programs 
operating profit for the electronic systems segment increased million  or  compared to the corresponding period in operating profit increased by about million due to higher volume and retirement of risks on air defense programs including pac and thaad and approximately million primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea warfare programs in these increases partially were offset by approximately million of reserves for contract cost matters on various ship and aviation programs including the terminated presidential helicopter program 
operating profit for the electronic systems segment increased by million  or  in compared to the increase primarily was attributable to volume and retirement of risk on various training and logistics services programs of about million  approximately million on tactical missiles programs including mlrs and jassm due to volume and the retirement of risks  and about million due to the retirement of risks on fire control programs 
these increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately million on undersea warfare programs due to lower volume and recognition of reserves 
backlog increased in compared to primarily due to orders exceeding sales on air defense programs including thaad and pac  partially offset by higher sales volume on various training and logistics activities and surface naval warfare programs 
backlog increased in compared to primarily from increased orders for air defense and tactical missile programs and on various training and logistics services programs 
these increases partially were offset by higher sales volume on ship and aviation systems and surface naval warfare programs 
we expect electronic systems net sales for will be comparable with we expect flat to low single digit percentage growth in key programs such as the lcs  offset by a decline in volume on logistics and training services contracts 
operating profit and margin are expected to be comparable with results 
information systems global solutions our is gs business segment provides management services  information technology it solutions  and advanced technology expertise across a broad spectrum of applications 
is gs supports the needs of customers in human capital planning  data protection and sharing  cyber security  financial services  health care  energy and environment  security  space exploration  biometrics  and transportation 
is gs provides network enabled situation awareness  delivers communications and command and control capability through complex mission solutions for defense applications  and integrates complex global systems to help our customers gather  analyze  and securely distribute critical intelligence data 
is gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments 
is gs major programs include the command and control  battle management  and communications contract  en route automation modernization eram contract  the hanford mission support contract  and the national science foundation s us antarctic support program 
we have classified pae and eig as discontinued operations note and  therefore  financial information related to these businesses has been excluded from the segment information below 
is gs operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margin backlog at year end 
table of contents net sales for the is gs segment decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease primarily was attributable to lower volume of approximately million due to the absence of the dris program that supported the us census and a decline in activities on the jtrs program 
this decrease partially was offset by increased net sales on numerous programs 
net sales for the is gs segment increased million  or  in compared to the increase primarily was attributable to higher volume of million on the dris program and the hanford mission support contract 
these increases partially were offset by lower volume on numerous smaller programs 
operating profit for the is gs segment increased million  or  in compared to operating profit increased approximately million due to volume and the retirement of risks in and the absence of reserves recognized in on numerous programs including among others  the nasa outsourcing desktop initiative odin about million and transportation worker identification credential and automated flight service station programs 
the increases in operating profit partially were offset by the absence of the dris program and a decline in activities on the jtrs program of about million 
operating profit for the is gs segment decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease primarily was attributable to the recognition of reserves of about million on several programs including  among others  the odin program 
lower volume on numerous programs offset increased operating profit from the dris program 
the decrease in backlog during compared to mainly was due to declining activities on the jtrs program and several other smaller programs 
the decrease in backlog during compared to mainly was due to higher sales volume associated with the dris program  the hanford mission support contract  and several other smaller programs 
we expect is gs will experience a decrease in net sales in the mid to upper single digit percentage range for as compared to the decline is primarily due to the completion of various programs including odin  the uk census  and jtrs  and we do not expect that this work will be replaced by other contracts due to the fiscal pressures constraining government purchases of it and other products and services 
operating profit is expected to decline in in the upper single digit percentage range as a result of the lower sales volume  resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years 
space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the design  research and development  engineering  and production of satellites  strategic and defensive missile systems  and space transportation systems  including activities related to the planned replacement of the space shuttle 
space systems is responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems 
space systems major programs include the trident ii d fleet ballistic missile  space based infrared system sbirs  orion  advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  global positioning satellite gps iii system  and mobile user objective system muos 
space systems has an ownership interest in united launch alliance ula  which provides expendable launch services for the us government  and in united space alliance usa  which provides processing activities for the space shuttle program  which is winding down following the completion of the last mission in space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margin backlog at year end net sales for the space systems segment decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease in net sales was attributable to a decline of about million related to the nasa external tank program  which ended in connection with the completion of the last space shuttle mission in july  a decline in volume of about million related to the orion program  and lower volume of approximately million related to government satellites 
these decreases partially were offset by higher volume for fleet ballistic and defensive missile systems of about million and commercial satellites of approximately million one commercial satellite delivery in both and 
net sales for the space systems segment decreased million or in compared to the decline principally was due to lower volume on defensive missile systems of approximately million  the nasa external tank 
table of contents program of about million due to the wind down of the space shuttle program and volume from commercial satellite and launch vehicle activities of approximately million 
there was one commercial satellite delivery in and and no commercial launches in compared to one commercial launch in partially offsetting these decreases was a growth of about million due to higher volume in government satellites activities 
operating profit for the space systems segment increased million  or  in compared to the increase in operating profit principally was attributable to retirement of risks on government satellite programs of about million and decreased equity earnings of about million primarily due to the completion of the space shuttle program 
operating profit for the space systems segment was unchanged for compared to operating profit increased on government satellites programs by approximately million due to higher volume and risk retirements and higher equity earnings of approximately million 
these increases were offset by lower volume and reserve for performance of about million on commercial satellite programs and lower volume on the nasa external tank program of approximately million 
total equity earnings recognized by the space systems segment from ula and usa represented approximately million  or of this segment s operating profit during during  total equity earnings recognized by the space systems segment from ula and usa represented approximately million  or of this segment s operating profit 
backlog decreased in compared to mainly due to higher sales volume associated with the orion program and on government satellite activities 
backlog increased in compared to mainly due to orders exceeding sales on government satellite programs and strategic missile programs  which more than offset higher sales volume compared to new orders on the orion program in we expect space systems net sales to decline in in the mid single digit percentage range as compared to primarily due to lower activities on government satellite programs and the orion program 
operating profit is expected to decline in the mid to upper single digit percentage range in due to the lower sales volume as well as lower equity earnings from ula  resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years 
liquidity and cash flows our access to capital resources that provide liquidity has not been materially affected by the changing economic and market conditions over the past few years 
we continually monitor changes in such conditions so that we can timely respond to any related developments 
we have generated strong operating cash flows which have been the primary source of funding for our operations  debt service and repayments  capital expenditures  share repurchases  dividends  acquisitions  and postretirement benefit plan funding 
we have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions  as needed or when opportunistic 
we expect our cash from operations to continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary  as discussed under capital structure  resources  and other 
we have access to the credit markets  if needed  for liquidity or general corporate purposes  including letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts 
cash received from customers  either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred  is our primary source of cash 
we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer 
billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors  including the contract type 
we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  which together represent approximately of the sales we recorded in  as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed 
in contrast to cost reimbursable contracts  for fixed price contracts  which represented approximately of the revenues we recorded in  we generally do not bill until milestones  including deliveries  are achieved 
a number of our fixed price contracts may provide for performance based payments which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract 
the us government recently has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed price contracts  rather than performance based payments 
the use of progress payment provisions on fixed price contracts may delay our ability to recover costs incurred and affect the timing of our cash flows 

table of contents the majority of our capital expenditures for and those planned for can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure  equipment  and it 
expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments 
for example  we have projects underway in our aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the f combat aircraft 
in addition  we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities 
we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure as well as for the development or purchase of internal use software 
we have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise 
consistent with that strategy  we have invested in our business  including capital expenditures and independent research and development  repurchased shares  increased our dividends  made selective acquisitions of businesses  and managed our debt levels 
the following table provides a summary of our cash flow information and the subsequent discussion provides an overview of our execution of this strategy 
in millions net cash provided by operating activities a net cash used for investing activities a net cash used for financing activities a in the fourth quarter of  we revised the classification of cash payments associated with the development or purchase of internal use software from operating cash flows to investing cash flows note 
cash flows for all years above have been adjusted for this change 
cash payments for internal use software were million in  million in  and million in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to billion in as compared to the increase in cash flows from operating activities was driven by a million increase in cash provided by operating working capital defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred as discussed below and million related to lower net income tax payments due to the absence of a payment made in related to matters pending with irs appeals 
these improvements partially were offset by a million net increase in cash outflows related to defined benefit pension plans  and lower operating results 
the increase in cash outflows related to defined benefit pension plans was due to a million increase in contributions paid to the pension trust and a decrease in the recovery of cas costs on our contracts 
the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital changes primarily was due to the timing of payment of accounts payable  which partially was offset by the timing of collections of accounts receivable and customer advance payments 
the change in accounts receivable primarily reflects the timing of contract negotiations and related billing activities on the f program at our aeronautics segment 
the decrease in cash flows from customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred was attributable to the c programs at our aeronautics segment  which was partially offset by various programs largely pac at our electronic systems segment 
our operating working capital is subject to wide fluctuations based on the timing of cash transactions related to production schedules  timing of progress and advance payments  the acquisition of inventory  the collection of accounts receivable  and the payment of accounts payable 
cash provided by changes in operating working capital balances in may decrease over primarily due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable 
consequently  we expect that net cash provided by operating activities will be lower in net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to billion in as compared to the increase primarily was attributable to changes in our operating working capital balances of million and million related to lower net income tax payments 
partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash of million related to our defined benefit pension plans 
the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in accounts receivable balances and an increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances 
these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in compared to the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems  is gs  and space systems business segments 
the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and c programs at aeronautics  partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems 
the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments 
the reduction in cash from defined benefit pension plans was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of million as compared to  partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts 

table of contents investing activities capital expenditures the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments 
we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure 
capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment amounted to million in  million in  and million in costs associated with the development or purchase of internal use software amounted to million in  million in  and million in  and have trended downward with the completion of certain infrastructure systems 
we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our planned annual capital expenditures over the next few years 
acquisitions  divestitures and other activities acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates 
we paid million in for acquisition activities  primarily related to the acquisition of qtc and sim industries bv note  compared to amounts paid in of million primarily related to investments in affiliates 
in  we paid million for acquisition activities 
in  we received proceeds of million from the sale of eig  net of million in transaction costs note 
there were no material divestiture activities in or during  we decreased our short term investments by million compared to an increase of million in financing activities share activity and dividends we paid cash totaling billion for share repurchases during  which included million for shares we repurchased in december but that were not paid for until january in and  we paid cash totaling billion and billion for share repurchases 
our share repurchase program provides for the repurchase of our common stock from time to time 
under the program  we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation 
in  our board authorized an additional billion for share repurchases  bringing the total authorized amount under the program to billion note 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares under the program for billion  and there remained billion available for additional share repurchases 
we paid our stockholders cash dividends of billion in  million in  and million in we have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years  including a increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of we declared quarterly dividends of 
per share during each of the first three quarters of and per share for the last quarter

cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during   and totaled million  million  and million 
those activities resulted in the issuance of million shares  million shares  and million shares during the respective periods 
issuance and repayment of long term debt in  we issued a total of billion of long term notes 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the long term notes that were issued in to redeem all of our million long term notes due in with a fixed coupon rate of 
in  we repurchased million of our long term notes through open market purchases 
we paid premiums of million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long term notes 
in  we issued a total of billion of long term notes  and we paid million in repayments of long term debt based on scheduled maturities 
capital structure  resources  and other at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of billion 
our long term debt  net of unamortized discounts  amounted to billion 
as of the end of  our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates and mainly is in the form of publicly issued notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements 
in  we issued billion of long term notes in a registered public offering consisting of million due in with a fixed coupon interest rate of  million due in with a fixed coupon interest rate of  and million due in with a fixed coupon interest rate of 
we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all of our million long term notes due in with a fixed coupon rate of 
in  we repurchased million of our long term notes through open market purchases 
we paid premiums of million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long term notes 

table of contents we issued million of new notes due the new notes in in exchange for million of our then outstanding debt securities 
we paid a premium of million  of which million was in the form of new notes and million was paid in cash  which was recorded as a discount and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the new notes using the effective interest method 
the new notes are included on our balance sheet net of unamortized discounts 
in  we issued a total of billion of long term notes in a registered public offering  million of which are due in and have a fixed coupon interest rate of  and million of which are due in and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 
in august  we entered into a new billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks and terminated our existing billion revolving credit facility which was to expire in june the new credit facility expires august  and we may request and the banks may grant  at their discretion  an increase to the new credit facility by an additional amount up to million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under either facility through december  borrowings under the new credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on a eurodollar rate or a base rate  as defined in the new credit facility 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the new credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio  as defined in the new credit facility 
we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the new credit facility 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission through august to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
we review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts  and maturities of our indebtedness 
we may at times refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
our stockholders equity was billion at december   a decrease of billion from december  the decrease primarily was due to the repurchase of million common shares for billion  dividends declared of billion during the year  and net adjustments related to our postretirement benefit plans  including the annual december re measurement adjustment of billion  which on a net basis increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by billion 
these decreases partially were offset by net earnings of billion  and employee stock activity of million 
as we repurchase our common shares  we reduce common stock for the of par value of the shares repurchased  with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program  additional paid in capital was reduced to zero  with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings 

table of contents contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  make payments under operating leases  settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services  and settle tax and other liabilities 
capital lease obligations were negligible 
payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years and years and after years long term debt a interest payments other liabilities operating lease obligations purchase obligations operating activities capital expenditures total contractual cash obligations a long term debt includes scheduled principal payments only 
amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long term liabilities recorded as of december  such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans  non qualified pension plans  environmental liabilities  and business acquisition agreements 
purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages 
such agreements and contracts may  for example  be related to direct materials  obligations to subcontractors  and outsourcing arrangements 
total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our us government customers 
the us government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts for convenience under the far  subject to available funding 
this also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a us government contract 
the termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign  state  and local governments 
we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions  including contracts with commercial customers 
purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts 
we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements  sometimes referred to as offset agreements  as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries 
these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country 
offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transferring technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  and the purchase by third parties eg  our vendors of supplies from in country vendors 
these agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in country vendors  providing financial support for in country projects  and building or leasing facilities for in country operations 
we typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive 
the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement 
at december   we had outstanding offset agreements totaling billion  primarily related to our aeronautics and electronic systems segments  some of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at december  that also satisfy offset agreements  those amounts are included in the preceding table 
offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements 
we historically have not been required to pay material penalties 
in connection with our ownership interest of united launch alliance  llc ula  we and the boeing company boeing have each received distributions totaling million since ula s formation in december which are subject to agreements between us  boeing  and ula  whereby  if ula does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with boeing  both we and boeing would provide to 
table of contents ula  in the form of an additional capital contribution  the level of funding required for ula to make those payments 
any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements 
we currently believe that ula will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity  including access to its million revolving credit agreement from third party financial institutions  to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under these agreements 
in addition  both we and boeing have cross indemnified each other for certain financial support arrangements eg  letters of credit or surety bonds provided by either party and guarantees by us and boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ula under certain launch service contracts 
we believe ula will be able to fully perform its obligations  as it has done through december   and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross indemnities or guarantees 
we have entered into standby letters of credit  surety bonds  and third party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and or the guarantee of future performance on certain of our contracts 
in some cases  we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners 
at december   we had the following outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds  and guarantees commitment expiration by period in millions total commitment less than year a years and a years and a after years a standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total commitments a approximately billion  million  and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year  years and  and years and  periods  and approximately million of surety bonds  are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
included in the table above is approximately million representing letter of credit amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the balance sheet  either as reductions of inventories  as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  or as other liabilities 
approximately billion of the standby letters of credit were issued to secure advance payments received under an f contract from an international customer 
these letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance  and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms 
similar to the letters of credit for the f contract  other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance 
approximately of the million in third party guarantees outstanding at december  related to guarantees of the contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party 
this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the joint venture partners 
we evaluate the reputation  technical capabilities  and credit quality of potential joint venture partners 
in addition  we generally have cross indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner 
we believe our current and former joint venture partners will be able to perform their obligations  as they have done through december   and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees 
critical accounting policies contract accounting sales recognition approximately of our net sales are derived from long term contracts for design  development  and production activities also referred to as dd p contracts and services provided to the us government  and fms conducted through the us government 
approximately of our net sales  including net sales related to dd p contracts with non us government customers  are accounted for using the poc method 
the poc model requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts 
our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non us government customers that are not associated with dd p activities  which we continue to account for under the services accounting model 

table of contents beginning january   we evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the us government  to the extent the contracts include multiple elements  to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting 
when we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate  we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices 
the contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long term in nature and include the provision of both dd p activities and services 
based on the nature of our business  we generally account for components of such contracts using the poc accounting model or the services accounting model  as appropriate 
this change in accounting has not had a material effect on our financial results  and is not expected to have a material effect in future periods 
we classify net sales as products or services on our statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract 
most of our long term contracts are denominated in us dollars  including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the us government 
we record sales for both dd p activities and services under cost reimbursable  fixed price  and time and materials contracts 
contract types cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts  which accounted for about of our total net sales in  provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee  up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded 
we generate revenue under two general types of cost reimbursable contracts cost plus award fee incentive fee which represent a substantial majority of our cost reimbursable contracts and cost plus fixed fee contracts 
cost plus award fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria  such as targets based on cost  quality  technical  and schedule criteria 
cost plus incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs incentive based on cost or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets incentive based on performance 
the fixed fee in a cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs 
fixed price and other contracts under fixed price contracts  which accounted for about of our total net sales in  we agree to perform the specified work for a pre determined price 
to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
some fixed price contracts have a performance based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance 
under time and materials contracts  which accounted for about of our total net sales in  we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended  and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out of pocket expenses 
to the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
poc method of accounting we record net sales and an estimated profit on a poc basis for cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts for dd p activities  and services contracts with the us government 
the poc method for dd p contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract 
for example  for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantities  sales are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs 
for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development  we record sales and an estimated profit on a poc basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract 
for contracts to provide services to the us government  sales are generally recorded using the cost to cost method 
award fees and incentives  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the poc method 
estimates of award fees are based on past experience and 
table of contents anticipated performance 
we record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
accounting for contracts under the poc method requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
for many of our contracts  we are only able to estimate costs in ranges of amounts 
those ranges are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials  performance by our subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer  among other variables 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 
at the outset of each contract  we estimate the initial profit booking rate 
the initial profit booking rate of each contract is based on the initial estimated costs at completion considering risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example  a newly developed product versus a mature product  schedule for example  the number and type of milestone events  and costs by contract requirements 
business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic reviews 
management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract also perform recurring evaluations of technical matters  scheduling  and contract costs 
profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical  schedule  and costs aspects of the contract 
likewise  the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring risks  and  as a result  our estimated costs at completion increase 
all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and  therefore  may affect the profit booking rate 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes 
for example  if we increase the estimated profit booking rate on a cost reimbursable contract  the increase in sales and operating profit for that contract will reflect a higher return on sales in the current period due to the recognition of the higher profit booking rate on both current period costs  as well as previously incurred costs 
as examples of how changes in profit booking rates can affect our financial statements  our net profit booking rate adjustments increased operating profit  net of state taxes  by approximately billion  billion  and billion for   and  as we were able to successfully retire risks across a broad portfolio of contracts in those periods 
services method of accounting for cost reimbursable contracts for services to non us government customers that provide for award and incentive fees  we record net sales as services are performed  exclusive of award and incentive fees 
award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable  generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer 
this approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals typically every six months throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications 
under a fixed price service contract  we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss 
we record net sales under fixed price service contracts on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred 
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulation far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  interest expense  and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and  therefore  not recoverable through sales 
in addition  we may enter into advance agreements with the us government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to 
table of contents contracts for specific matters 
for example  most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the us government 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with us government regulations by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
postretirement benefit plans many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans  and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees collectively  postretirement benefit plans see note 
the impact of these plans and benefits on our gaap earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions  including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets  and workforce demographics 
we recognize on a plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under gaap as either an asset or liability on our balance sheets  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  in stockholders equity 
the gaap funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan 
the funding of our pension plans is determined in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa  as amended by the pension protection act of ppa 
our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least  as determined by the ppa 
the us government cost accounting standards cas govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the us government  including fms 
different actuarial valuations are used for gaap  erisa and cas resulting in three different measurements of the funded status of our plans 
actuarial assumptions gaap requires that the amounts we record related to our plans be computed using actuarial valuations 
the primary year end assumptions used to estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for all postretirement benefit plans  the rates of increase in future compensation levels for the participants in our defined benefit pension plans  and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans 
the discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year 
the difference between the long term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years 
when reassessing these assumptions each year we consider past and current market conditions  and make judgments about future market trends 
we also have to consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
we selected as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at december  related to our defined benefit pension plans  compared to at the end of and at the end of we selected as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at december  related to our retiree medical plans  compared to at the end of and at the end of we evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate  including results from cash flow models  quoted rates from long term bond indices  and changes in long term bond rates over the past year 
as part of our evaluation  we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows 
our postretirement benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better 
we concluded that was a reasonable estimate for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption at december   as compared to used in prior years 
the expected long term rate of return assumption was adjusted downward due to the impact sovereign debt among developed countries may have on the rate of economic growth 
the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested  or to be invested  to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation 
this assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns  the anticipated long term allocation of plan assets  the historical return data for the trust funds  plan expenses  and the potential to outperform market index returns 
the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption  but the average expected return over a long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption 
as a result  changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate 

table of contents our stockholders equity has been reduced by billion from the annual year end measurement of the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans  inclusive of the december  adjustment of billion 
these noncash  after tax amounts primarily represent net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates and differences between actual experience and our actuarial assumptions  which will be amortized to expense in future periods 
during  million of these amounts was recognized as a component of our postretirement benefit plans expense and million is expected to be recognized as expense in we expect that our pension expense will increase to billion as compared with pension expense of billion  primarily due to an increase in the amortization of net actuarial gains and losses caused by the decrease in the discount rate mentioned above 
the discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment 
a reasonably possible change of plus or minus basis points in the discount rate assumption at december   with all other assumptions held constant  would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately billion  which would have resulted in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholders equity at the end of the year of approximately million 
if the discount rate at december  that was used to compute the expected expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been basis points higher or lower  with all other assumptions held constant  the amount of expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million 
funding considerations the ppa became applicable to us and other large us defense contractors beginning in and had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions 
we made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of billion in  billion in  and billion in we recovered million in  million in and million in as cas costs 
amounts funded under cas are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  including fms  and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales 
amounts contributed in excess of the cas funding requirements  over billion  are considered to be prepayment credits under the cas rules 
we expect to make contributions of billion related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in and anticipate recovering billion as cas cost in which is consistent with our anticipated contributions 
we may review options for further contributions in the cas board published its revised pension accounting rules cas harmonization with an effective date of february  to better align the recovery of pension contributions  including prepayment credits  on us government contracts with the accelerated funding requirements of the ppa 
the cas harmonization rules will increase our cas cost beginning in there is a transition period during which the cost impact of the new rules will be phased in  with the full impact occurring in while we expect our cas costs to be higher than our estimate for of billion  the estimated incremental impact of cas harmonization in will be a very modest cost increase  with much larger increases occurring successively in years through based upon current assumptions which may change  the increase in cas costs caused by cas harmonization should result in increased earnings a few years from now  as our cas costs should be in excess of the pension expense we record under gaap 
accordingly  our non cash fas cas pension adjustment  discussed further in the discussion of business segments section above  should eventually increase earnings rather than decrease earnings as it has the past few years 
in addition  the increase in cas costs should eventually cause our cas costs to be greater than our pension contributions as we recover the prepayment credits  which should increase our cash flow from operations 
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements  proceedings  and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by a state agency 
at the end of  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was million 
we have recorded receivables totaling million at december  for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the us government  as discussed below 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non us government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under us government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales 
we project costs and recovery of costs over approximately twenty years 

table of contents we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation 
we also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation 
environmental cleanup activities usually span many years  which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to  for example  changing remediation technologies 
to determine the costs related to cleanup sites  we have to assess the extent of contamination  effects on natural resources  the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation  and evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in notes and to the financial statements 
we consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions  which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site 
we do not discount the recorded liabilities  as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined 
given the required level of judgment and estimation  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination 
both the epa and the california office of environmental health hazard assessment announced plans in january to regulate two chemicals  perchlorate and hexavalent chromium  to levels in drinking water that are expected to be substantially lower than the existing public health goals or standards established in california 
the rulemaking process is a lengthy one and may take one or more years to complete 
if a substantially lower standard is adopted  we would expect a material increase in our estimates for remediation at several existing sites 
under agreements reached with the us government  most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government business  after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation  regardless of the contract form eg cost reimbursable  fixed price 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing  among other factors  us government regulations  our us government business base and contract mix  and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs 
as disclosed above  we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites  which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental receivable and a charge to earnings 
for example  if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by million  the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately million  with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings 
this allocation is determined annually  based upon our existing and projected business activities with the us government 
we cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved 
there are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation 
in some cases  although a loss may be probable  it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties eg  assessing the extent of the contamination 
during any particular quarter  such uncertainties may be resolved to allow us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site 
the amount of the liability could be material 
upon recognition of the liability  a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to operations 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation 
under existing environmental laws  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are required to pursue by agreement and us government regulation 

table of contents goodwill our goodwill at december  and amounted to billion and billion 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit 
the assessment is performed at the reporting unit level 
our annual testing date is october performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including how we define reporting units and determine their fair value 
we consider a component of our business to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodologies 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  perpetual growth rates  relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values  we evaluate our results against other value indicators such as comparable company public trading values  research analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
we completed our assessment of goodwill as of october  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and  as such  no impairment existed at that date 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of failing a goodwill impairment test in the near term  as their fair values are significantly greater than their carrying values 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued new accounting standards that are not effective until after december  for additional information  see the recent accounting pronouncements section within note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions 
we believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct business 
we continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of  and access to  sufficient credit resources 
our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices on certain equity securities 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt 
at december   the estimated fair value of our long term debt instruments was approximately billion  compared with a carrying value of billion  excluding unamortized discounts of million 
a change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our long term debt outstanding at december  we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to manage the exchange rate risk of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash receipts and cash payments 
the majority of our foreign currency exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
we also use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate  long term debt 
our interest rate swap 
table of contents contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
related gains and losses on foreign currency exchange and interest rate swap contracts  to the extent they are effective hedges  are recognized in earnings at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
to the extent the hedges are ineffective  gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in current period earnings 
the aggregate notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts at december  and was billion and billion 
the aggregate notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts at december  was million 
there were no interest rate swap contracts outstanding at december  at december  and  the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material note 
a appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at december  would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our cash flows 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed 
our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we maintain a rabbi trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
as of december   investments in the rabbi trust totaled million and are reflected at fair value on our balance sheet in other assets 
the rabbi trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates 
changes in the value of the rabbi trust are recognized on our statement of earnings in other non operating income  net  and were not material during a portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the rabbi trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices 
changes in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities are recognized on our statement of earnings in unallocated corporate costs and were not material during the current portion of the deferred compensation plan liabilities is on our balance sheet in salaries  benefits  and payroll taxes  and the non current portion of the liability is on our balance sheet in other liabilities 
the resulting change in the value of the liabilities has the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the rabbi trust
