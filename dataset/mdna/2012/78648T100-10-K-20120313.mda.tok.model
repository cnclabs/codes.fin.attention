table of contents our strategy to achieve our goal of increasing shareholder value  our strategy is to maintain and develop strong independent agent relationships by providing our agents with a full package of insurance products and information technology services 
we believe this strategy will allow us to further penetrate the massachusetts and new hampshire private passenger  commercial automobile and homeowners insurance markets  implement rates  forms and billing options that allow us to cross sell homeowners  dwelling fire  and personal umbrella in the personal lines market and business owner policies  commercial property package and commercial umbrella in the commercial lines market in order to capture a larger share of the total massachusetts property and casualty insurance business written by each of our independent agents  and continue to expand our technology to enable independent agents to more easily serve their customers and conduct business with us  thereby strengthening their relationships with us 
the massachusetts property and casualty insurance market introduction 
we are licensed by the commissioner of insurance the commissioner to transact property and casualty insurance in massachusetts 
all of our business is extensively regulated by the commissioner 
the massachusetts market for private passenger automobile insurance 
private passenger automobile insurance has been heavily regulated in massachusetts 
in many respects  the private passenger automobile insurance market in massachusetts prior to was unique  in comparison to other states 
this was due to a number of factors  including unusual regulatory conditions  the market dominance of domestic companies  the relative absence of large national companies  and the heavy reliance on independent insurance agents as the market s principal distribution channel 
perhaps most significantly  prior to  the massachusetts commissioner of insurance fixed and established the premium rates and the rating plan to be used by all insurance companies doing business in the private passenger automobile insurance market 
the massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance residual market mechanism featured a reinsurance program run by car in which companies were assigned exclusive representative producers erps 
in  the commissioner issued a series of decisions to introduce what she termed managed competition managed competition to massachusetts automobile insurance premium rates and in doing so replaced the fixed and established regime with a prior approval rate review process  governed by regulations that set certain terms and conditions that insurers must comply with in establishing their rates 
the commissioner also replaced the former reinsurance program with an assigned risk plan 
these decisions removed many of the factors that had historically distinguished the massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market from the market in other states 
however  certain of the historically unique factors have not been eliminated  including compulsory insurance  affinity group marketing  and the prominence of independent agents 
products historically  we have focused on underwriting private passenger automobile insurance  which is written through our subsidiary  safety insurance 
in  we formed safety indemnity to offer commercial automobile insurance at preferred rates

table of contents distribution we distribute our products exclusively through independent agents  unlike some of our competitors who use multiple distribution channels 
we believe this gives us a competitive advantage with the agents 
with the exception of personal automobile business assigned to us by the massachusetts automobile insurance plan maip or written through car s commercial automobile limited servicing carrier program  we do not accept business from insurance brokers 
our voluntary agents have authority pursuant to our voluntary agency agreement to bind our insurance subsidiaries for any coverage that is within the scope of their authority 
we reserve the ability under massachusetts law to cancel any coverage  other than private passenger automobile insurance  within the first days after it is bound 
in total  our independent agents numbered and had offices some agencies have more than one office and approximately  customer service representatives during voluntary agents 
in  we obtained approximately of our direct written premiums for automobile insurance and of our direct written premiums for all of our other lines of business through our voluntary agents 
as of january   we had agreements with voluntary agents 
our voluntary agents are located in all regions of massachusetts 
we look for agents with profitable portfolios of business 
to become a voluntary agent for our company  we generally require that an agency i have been in business for at least five years  ii have exhibited a three year private passenger average ratio of losses  excluding loss adjustment expenses  to net earned premiums pure loss ratio of or less on the portion of the agent s portfolio that we would underwrite  iii make a commitment for us to underwrite at least policies from the agency during the first twelve months after entering an agreement with us  and iv offer multiple product lines 
every year  we review the performance of our agents during the prior year 
if an agent fails to meet our profitability standards  we try to work with the agent to improve the profitability of the business it places with us 
we generally terminate contracts each year with a few agencies  which  despite our efforts  have been consistently unable to meet our standards 
although independent agents usually represent several unrelated insurers  our goal is to be one of the top two insurance companies represented in each of our agencies  as measured by premiums 
no individual agency generated more than of our direct written premiums in exclusive representative producers 
in  our erps including commercial generated approximately of our direct written premiums for automobile insurance 
car defines erps as licensed dwelling fire or casualty insurance agents or brokers who have a place of business in massachusetts  but have no existing voluntary independent agency relationship with an automobile insurer conducting business in massachusetts 
massachusetts law guarantees that car provide motor vehicle insurance coverage to all qualified applicants 
to facilitate this system  under car s prior rules  any qualified licensed insurance producer that was unable to obtain a voluntary automobile relationship with an insurer became an erp and was assigned to an insurer  which was then required to write that agent s policies 
the maip began april  and was fully implemented by april  beginning april   all private passenger automobile business was eligible for maip except those risks that had no violations or accidents in the preceding three year period so called clean in three risks 
we are required by maip to write clean in three business submitted by our former erps 
the last policy effective date on which any private passenger automobile risk could be ceded to car was march  under maip  policies will be assigned to us for three years  unless the policyholder is offered a voluntary policy by another insurer 
beginning april   all massachusetts agents including erps were authorized to submit eligible business to the maip for random assignment to a servicing carrier such as safety insurance 
we began receiving individual policies assigned to us from the maip on april  as a result of car s new rules effective april   erps were no longer assigned to us or any massachusetts personal automobile insurer  and we have been instead allocated all residual market business through the maip 

table of contents car runs a reinsurance pool for commercial automobile policies 
on january   car implemented a limited servicing carrier program lsc for ceded commercial automobile policies 
car approved safety insurance and five other servicing carriers through a request for proposal to process ceded commercial automobile business for a five year term ending january  during car requested bids through a request for proposal process that reduced the number of servicing carriers from six to four 
car approved safety and three other servicing carriers to process ceded commercial automobile insurance with a delayed effective date of july  approximately  of ceded premium was spread equitably among the four servicing carriers 
subject to the commissioner s review  car sets the premium rates for commercial automobile policies reinsured through car and this reinsurance pool can generate an underwriting result that is a profit or deficit based upon car s rate level 
this underwriting result is allocated among every massachusetts commercial automobile insurance company  including us  based on a company s commercial automobile voluntary market share 
car also runs a reinsurance pool for taxi  limousine and car service risks the taxi limo program 
on april   safety submitted through a request for proposal a bid to process a portion of the taxi limo program 
car approved safety as one of the two servicing carriers for this program beginning january  during  car requested bids through a request for proposal process to extend the program another five years 
car approved safety as one of the two servicing carriers for this program beginning january  approximately  of ceded premium was spread equitably between the two servicing carriers 
we are assigned independent agents by car who can submit commercial business to us in the lsc and taxi limo program  and we classify those agents as commercial erps 
the table below shows our direct written exposures in each of our product lines for the periods indicated and the change in exposures for each product line 
years ended december  line of business exposures change exposures change exposures change private passenger automobile voluntary agents erps maip total private passenger automobile commercial automobile voluntary agents erps total commercial automobile other homeowners business owners personal umbrella dwelling fire commercial umbrella total other total total voluntary agents total erps 
table of contents our total written exposures increased by for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of our voluntary agent written exposures increasing by 
our erp written exposures  which include clean in three exposures written by our former erps  decreased by 
our private passenger automobile exposures increased by in primarily as a result of the increase in written exposures due to the transition to maip effective april  as discussed above 
our commercial automobile exposures increased by in primarily as a result of additional exposures being submitted from erps through the car lsc program as there are now only four limited servicing carriers 
our other than auto exposures increased by in primarily as a result of our voluntary agents efforts to sell multiple products to their clients and our pricing strategy of offering account discounts to policyholders who insure both their home and automobile with us 
in  of the private passenger automobile exposures we insure had an other than private passenger policy with us  compared to and in and  respectively 
in addition  of our homeowners policyholders had a matching automobile policy with us in compared to in and marketing we view the independent agent as our customer and business partner 
as a result  a component of our marketing efforts focuses on developing interdependent relationships with leading massachusetts agents that write profitable business and positioning ourselves as the preferred insurance carrier of those agents  thereby receiving a larger portion of each agent s aggregate business 
our principal marketing strategies to agents are to offer a range of products  which we believe enables our agents to meet the insurance needs of their clients  and overcomes the agent s resistance to placing their clients automobile  homeowners and other coverages with different insurers  to price our products competitively  including offering discounts when and where appropriate for safer drivers and for affinity groups for our personal automobile products  loss free credits for our homeowner products and also offering account discounts for policyholders that have more than one policy with us  to design  price and market our products to our agents for their customers to place all their insurance with us  to offer agents competitive commissions  with incentives for placing their more profitable business with us  and to provide a level of support and service that enhances the agent s ability to do business with its clients and with us 
beginning in  we started a comprehensive branding campaign using a variety of radio  television  internet and print advertisements 
commission schedule and profit sharing plan 
we have several programs designed to attract profitable new business from agents by paying them more than the minimum commission the law requires for private passenger auto which is of premiums for and 
we recognize our top performing agents by making them members of either our chairman s elite  chairman s  president s  executive s or preferred agent s club 
in  members of these clubs received a commission of up to of premiums for each new private passenger auto policy and up to of premiums for each new homeowner policy 
further  we have a competitive agency incentive commission program under which we pay agents up to of premiums based on the loss ratio on their business 

table of contents we have received no inquiries from the commissioner relative to how we conduct our contingent commissions and profit sharing programs 
the massachusetts attorney general did question the inclusion of contingent commission expenses in her appeal of our april  private passenger rate filing 
the commissioner ruled on january  that the inclusion of expenses attributable to contingent commissions was reasonable and not prohibited by massachusetts law 
service and support 
we believe that the level and quality of service and support we provide helps differentiate us from other insurers 
we have made a significant investment in information technology designed to facilitate our agents business 
our avc website helps agents manage their work efficiently 
we provide a substantial amount of information online that agents need to serve their customers  such as information about the status of new policies  bill payments and claims 
providing this type of content reduces the number of customer calls we receive and empowers the agent s customer service representatives by enabling them to respond to customers inquiries while the customer is on the telephone 
finally  we believe that the knowledge and experience of our employees enhances the quality of support we provide 
underwriting our underwriting department is responsible for a number of key decisions affecting the profitability of our business  including pricing of our private passenger automobile product since april   pricing of our commercial automobile  homeowners  dwelling fire  personal umbrella  business owners policies  commercial umbrella and commercial package products  determining underwriting guidelines for all our products  and evaluating whether to accept transfers of a portion of an existing or potential new agent s portfolio from another insurer 
we are organized into three underwriting units  a separate unit for private passenger automobile  a separate unit for all other personal lines underwriting including homeowners  dwelling fire  personal umbrella and inland marine coverages  and a separate unit for commercial lines  including commercial auto  business owners policies  commercial umbrella and commercial package policies 
pricing 
prior to april   our pricing strategy for private passenger automobile insurance primarily depended on the maximum permitted premium rates and minimum permitted commission levels mandated by the commissioner 
beginning april  subject to the commissioner s review  we set rates for our private passenger business using industry loss cost data  our own loss experience  residual market deficits  catastrophe modeling and prices charged by our competitors in the massachusetts market 
beginning april  subject to commissioner s review  car sets the premium rates for personal automobile policies assigned to carriers by the maip 
however  companies may only charge the insured the lower of the car maip rate or the company s competitive voluntary market rate 
safety insurance s approved rates consist of tiers effective march  we offer group discounts to members of affinity groups 
in general  we target affinity groups with a mature and stable membership base along with favorable driving records  offering between a and discount with being the average discount offered 
approximately of the private passenger exposures we write receive an affinity group discount 
subject to the commissioner s review  car sets the premium rates for commercial automobile policies reinsured through car 
subject to the commissioner s review  we set rates for commercial automobile policies that are not reinsured through car  and for all other insurance lines we offer  including homeowners  dwelling fire  personal umbrella  commercial umbrella  commercial package policies and business owner policies 
we base our rates on industry loss cost data  our own loss 
table of contents experience  residual market deficits  catastrophe modeling and prices charged by our competitors in the massachusetts market 
we have three pricing tiers for most products  utilizing safety insurance for standard rates  safety indemnity for preferred rates and safety p c for ultra preferred rates 
car reinsurance pool 
car runs a reinsurance pool for commercial automobile policies and beginning january   we became one of six servicing carriers that could service commercial automobile policies for car 
in  car reduced the number of servicing carriers to four  and car approved safety and three other servicing carriers effective july  to continue the program 
car also runs a reinsurance pool for taxi limousine car service commercial automobile policies and beginning january   we became one of two servicing carriers that can service these policies for car 
all commercial automobile business that is not written in the voluntary market is apportioned to one of the four servicing carriers who handle the business on behalf of car or to one of the two servicing carriers who handle the business on behalf of car for taxi limousine car service business 
each massachusetts commercial automobile insurer must bear a portion of the losses of the total commercial reinsurance pool that is serviced by the approved servicing carriers 
bulk policy transfers and new voluntary agents 
from time to time  we receive proposals from existing voluntary agents to transfer a portfolio of the agent s business from another insurer to us 
our underwriters model the profitability of these portfolios before we accept these transfers 
among other things  we usually require that the private passenger portion of the portfolio have a pure loss ratio of or less on the portion of the agent s portfolio that we would underwrite 
in addition  we require any new voluntary agent to commit to transfer a portfolio to us consisting of at least policies 
policy processing and rate pursuit 
our underwriting department assists in processing policy applications  endorsements  renewals and cancellations 
for many years  we have used and implemented proprietary software that enables agents to connect to our network and enter policy and endorsement applications for private passenger automobile insurance from their office computers 
in our private passenger automobile insurance line  our agents now submit approximately of all applications for new policies or endorsements for existing policies through our proprietary information portal  the avc 
we also offer propriety software for our commercial automobile and homeowners insurance lines of business that provides the same functionality as that of our personal automobile software 
our rate pursuit team aggressively monitors all insurance transactions to make sure we receive the correct premium for the risk insured 
we accomplish this by verifying massachusetts pricing criteria  such as proper classification of drivers  the make  model  and age of insured vehicles  and the availability of discounts 
we verify that operators are properly listed and classified  assignment of operators to vehicles  vehicle garaging  vehicle pre inspection requirements  and in some cases the validity of discounts 
in our homeowners and dwelling fire lines  our team has completed a project to update the replacement costs for each dwelling 
we use third party software to assist in these appraisal efforts 
technology the focuses of our information technology effort are to constantly re engineer internal processes to allow more efficient operations  resulting in lower operating costs  to make it easier for independent agents to transact business with us  and to enable agents to efficiently provide their clients with a high level of service 
we believe that our technology initiatives have increased revenue and decreased costs 
for example  these initiatives have allowed us to reduce the number of call center transactions which we perform  and to transfer many manual processing functions from our internal operations to our 
table of contents independent agents 
we also believe that these initiatives have contributed to overall increases in productivity 
internal applications intranet our employees access our proprietary applications through our corporate intranet 
our intranet applications streamline internal processes and improve overall operational efficiencies in areas including claims 
our claims workload management application allows our claims and subrogation adjusters to better manage injury claims 
subrogation refers to the process by which we are reimbursed by other insurers for claims costs we incur due to the fault of their insureds 
the use of this application has reduced the time it takes for us to respond to and settle casualty claims  which we believe helps reduce the total amount of our claims expense 
the automated adjuster assignment system categorizes our new claims by severity and assigns them to the appropriate adjuster responsible for investigation 
once assigned  the integrated workload management tools facilitate the work of promptly assigning appraisers  investigating liability  issuing checks and receiving subrogation receipts 
the radicalglass 
com application allows our claims department to contain glass costs by increasing the windshield repair to replacement ratio 
for every windshield that is repaired rather than replaced there is an average savings of approximately per windshield claim 
our first vip claims center was introduced during to provide increased service levels to our independent insurance agents and their clients 
we currently operate three vip claims centers which use a network of rental car centers and auto body repair shops to provide a higher level of service to the clients of the independent insurance agents while reducing costs  such as rental expense  through reduced cycle times 
billing 
proprietary billing systems  integrated with the systems of our print and lock box vendors  expedite the processing and collection of premium receipts and finance charges from agents and policyholders 
we believe the sophistication of our direct bill system helps us to limit our bad debt expense 
in both and  our bad debt expense as a percentage of direct written premiums was 
external applications our agent technology offerings are centralized within our agency portal and feature powerdesk and safety express 
powerdesk is a web based application that allows for billing inquiry  payment notification  policy inquiry and claims inquiry 
safety express provides agents with new business and endorsement entry  real time policy issuance for personal lines  immediate printing of declarations pages in agents offices  policy downloads to most major agency management systems and data imports from boston software s winrater massachusetts and vertafore s pl rater new hampshire 
in addition  safety provides its agents with commission downloads for all lines of business  transformation station and transact now inquires  e claims online claims reporting  e view daily transaction reports and e docs online electronic document file cabinet 
safety also provides online bill pay  including credit and debit cards  online declarations pages  billing inquiry  claims inquiry  auto claims first notice of loss  online auto insurance cards  and bill pay reminder alerts to our agent s policyholders through www 
safetyinsurance 
com 
safety has also updated its telephone system to provide a voice activated phone directory  automated billing inquiry and payments  and call center screen pop up technology 
in  safety also entered the mobile application space when it introduced safety mobile for the iphone and android 
safety mobile allows consumers access to their agent information  the ability to report an automobile accident and access to their insurance card  among other features 

table of contents claims because of the unique differences between the management of casualty claims and property claims  we use separate departments for each of these types of claims 
casualty claims we have adopted stringent claims settlement procedures  which include guidelines that establish maximum settlement offers for soft tissue injuries  which constituted approximately of our bodily injury claims in if we are unable to settle these claims within our guidelines  we generally take the claim to litigation 
we believe that these procedures result in providing our adjusters with a uniform approach to negotiation 
we believe an important component of handling claims efficiently is prompt investigation and settlement 
we find that faster claims settlements often result in less expensive claims settlements 
our e claim reporting system is an online product that reduces the time it takes for agents to notify our adjusters about claims  thereby enabling us to contact third party claimants and other witnesses quickly 
after business hours  we outsource claims adjustment support to an independent firm whose employees contact third party claimants and other witnesses 
we believe that early notification results in our adjusters conducting prompt investigations of claims and compiling more accurate information about those claims 
our claims workload management software also assists our adjusters in handling claims quickly 
we believe the structure of our casualty claims unit allows us to respond quickly to claimants anywhere in massachusetts and new hampshire 
comprising people  the department is organized into distinct claim units that contain loss costs for soft tissue injuries 
field adjusters are located geographically for prompt response to claims  with our litigation unit focused on managing loss costs and litigation expenses for serious injury claims 
additionally  we utilize a special unit to investigate fraud in connection with casualty claims 
this special unit has one manager and nine employees 
in cases where adjusters suspect fraud in connection with a claim  we deploy this special unit to conduct investigations 
we deny payment to claimants in cases in which we have succeeded in accumulating sufficient evidence of fraud 
property claims our property claims unit handles property claims arising in our private passenger and commercial automobile  homeowners and other insurance lines 
process automation has streamlined our property claims function 
many of our property claims are now handled by our agents through avc using our power desk software application 
as agents receive calls from claimants  power desk permits the agent to immediately send information related to the claim directly to us and to an independent appraiser selected by the agent to value the claim 
once we receive this information  an automated system redirects the claim to the appropriate internal adjuster responsible for investigating the claim to determine liability 
upon determination of liability  the system automatically begins the process of seeking a subrogation recovery from another insurer  if liable 
we believe this process results in a shorter time period from when the claimant first contacts the agent to when the claimant receives a claim payment  while enabling our agents to build credibility with their clients by responding to claims in a timely and efficient manner 
we benefit from decreased labor expenses from the need for fewer employees to handle the reduced property claims call volume 

table of contents another important factor in keeping our overall property claims costs low is collecting subrogation recoveries 
we track the amounts we pay out in claims costs and identify cases in which we believe we can reclaim some or all of those costs through the use of our automated workload management tools 
reserves significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the expenses associated with investigating and paying the losses  or loss adjustment expenses 
every quarter  we review and establish our reserves 
regulations promulgated by the commissioner require us to annually obtain a certification from either a qualified actuary or an approved loss reserve specialist who may be one of our employees that our loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves are reasonable 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain reserves for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported 
incurred but not yet reported reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of our historical information and experience 
we make adjustments to incurred but not yet reported reserves quarterly to take into account changes in the volume of business written  claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  claims processing and other items that can be expected to affect our liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses over time 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historical loss experience and that of the industry  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors 
after taking into account all relevant factors  management believes that our provision for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and claims incurred as of that date 
management determines its loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves estimates based upon the analysis of the company s actuaries 
management has established a process for the company s actuaries to follow in establishing reasonable reserves 
the process consists of meeting with our claims department  establishing ultimate incurred losses by using development models accepted by the actuarial community  and reviewing the analysis with management 
the company s estimate for loss and lae reserves  net of the effect of ceded reinsurance  ranges from a low of  to a high of  as of december  the company s net loss and lae reserves  based on our actuaries best estimate  were set at  as of december  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than reserves carried at the balance sheet date 
establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the 
table of contents deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a credit to earnings in the period the redundancy is recognized 
we do not discount any of our reserves 
the following table presents development information on changes in the reserves for losses and lae of our insurance subsidiaries for each year in the three year period ended december  years ended december  reserves for losses and lae at beginning of year less receivable from reinsurers related to unpaid losses and lae net reserves for losses and lae at beginning of year incurred losses and lae  related to current year prior years total incurred losses and lae paid losses and lae related to current year prior years total paid losses and lae net reserves for losses and lae at end of period plus receivable from reinsurers related to unpaid losses and lae reserves for losses and lae at end of period at the end of each period  the reserves were re estimated for all prior accident years 
our prior year reserves decreased by   and  during  and  respectively 
the decrease in prior year reserves during resulted from re estimations of prior year ultimate loss and lae liabilities and is primarily composed of reductions of  in our retained automobile reserves and  in our retained homeowners 
it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past experience 
the following table represents the development of reserves  net of reinsurance  for calendar years through the top line of the table shows the reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this represents the estimated amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all years that were unpaid at the balance sheet date  including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us 
the upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each successive year with respect to those claims 
the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year  including cumulative payments made since the end of the respective year 
the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the payments  frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
favorable loss development  shown as a cumulative redundancy in the table  exists when the original reserve estimate is greater than the re estimated reserves at december  information with respect to the cumulative development of gross reserves that is  without deduction for reinsurance ceded also appears at the bottom portion of the table 
in evaluating the information in the table  it should be noted that each amount entered incorporates the effects of all changes in amounts entered for prior periods 
thus  if the estimate for a previously incurred loss was  and the loss was reserved at  in  the  
table of contents deficiency later estimate minus original estimate would be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency in each of the years shown in the table 
it should further be noted that the table does not present accident or policy year development data 
in addition  conditions and trends that have affected the development of liability in the past may not necessarily recur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies from the table 
as of and for the year ended december  reserves for losses and lae originally estimated cumulative amounts paid as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later as of and for the year ended december  reserves re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative redundancy deficiency as of and for the years ended december  gross liability end of year reinsurance recoverables net liability end of year gross estimated liability latest reinsurance recoverables latest net estimated liability latest 
table of contents as the table shows  our net reserves grew at a faster rate than our gross reserves over the ten year period 
as we have grown  we have been able to retain a greater percentage of our direct business 
additionally  in the past we conducted substantial business as a servicing carrier for other insurers  in which we would service the residual market automobile insurance business assigned to other carriers for a fee 
all business generated through this program was ceded to the other carriers 
as we reduced the amount of our servicing carrier business  our proportion of reinsurance ceded diminished 
the table also shows that we have substantially benefited in the current and prior years from releasing redundant reserves 
in the years ended december    and we decreased loss reserves related to prior years by   and  respectively 
reserves and development are discussed further in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive summary and overview 
as a result of our focus on core business lines since our founding in  we believe we have no exposure to asbestos or environmental pollution liabilities 
reinsurance we reinsure with other insurance companies a portion of our potential liability under the policies we have underwritten  thereby protecting us against an unexpectedly large loss or a catastrophic occurrence that could produce large losses  primarily in our homeowners line of business 
reinsurance involves an insurance company transferring ceding a portion of its exposure on insurance underwritten by it to another insurer reinsurer 
the reinsurer assumes a portion of the exposure in return for a share of the premium 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurance company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies  but it does make the reinsurer liable to the company for the reinsured portion of any loss realized 
we are selective in choosing our reinsurers  seeking only those companies that we consider to be financially stable and adequately capitalized 
in an effort to minimize exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer  we continually evaluate and review the financial condition of our reinsurers 
swiss re  our primary reinsurer  maintains an am best rating of a excellent 
most of our reinsurers have an am best rating of a excellent  however in no case is a reinsurer rated below a excellent 
we maintain reinsurance coverage to help lessen the effect of losses from catastrophic events  maintaining coverage that during protected us in the event of a year storm that is  a storm of a severity expected to occur once in a year period 
we use various software products to measure our exposure to catastrophe losses and the probable maximum loss to us for catastrophe losses such as hurricanes 
the models include estimates for our share of the catastrophe losses generated in the residual market for property insurance by the massachusetts property insurance underwriting association fair plan 
in  we purchased four layers of excess catastrophe reinsurance providing coverage for property losses in excess of  up to a maximum of  our reinsurers co participation was of  for the st layer  of  for the nd layer  of  for the rd layer  and of  for the th layer 
our losses from catastrophic weather events in massachusetts have been less than our retention to date 
the reinsurance market has seen from the various software modelers  increases in the estimate of damage from hurricanes in the southern and northeast portions of the united states due to revised estimations of increased hurricane activity and increases in cost of repairs due to increased estimates in the amount of demand surge in the periods following a significant event 
we continue to manage our exposure to catastrophes such as hurricanes  and to the changes to the various software models that we use to model our exposure  and continually adjust our reinsurance programs 
for  we have purchased four layers of excess catastrophe reinsurance providing coverage for property losses in excess of  up to a maximum of  our reinsurers co participation is of  for the st layer  of  for the nd layer  of  for the rd layer  and of  
table of contents for the th layer 
as a result of these changes to the models  and our revised reinsurance program  we maintain coverage that protects us in the event of a year storm 
we also have casualty excess of loss reinsurance for large casualty losses occurring in our automobile  homeowners  dwelling fire  business owners  and commercial package lines of business in excess of  up to a maximum of  we have property excess of loss reinsurance coverage for large property losses  with coverage in excess of  up to a maximum of  for our homeowners  business owners  and commercial package policies 
in addition  we have liability excess of loss reinsurance for umbrella large losses in excess of  up to a maximum of  we also have various reinsurance agreements with hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company  of which the primary contract is a quota share agreement under which we cede of the premiums and losses for the equipment breakdown coverage under our business owner policies and commercial package policies 
in the wake of the september  tragedies  reinsurers began to exclude coverage for claims in connection with any act of terrorism 
our reinsurance program excludes coverage for acts of terrorism  except for fire or collapse losses as a result of terrorism  under homeowners  dwelling fire  private passenger automobile and commercial automobile policies 
for business owner policies and commercial package policies  terrorism is excluded if the total insured value is greater than  the terrorism risk insurance act of tria was signed into law on november   and expired december  the terrorism risk insurance extension act of was signed into law on december   and expired december  the terrorism risk insurance extension act of triea was signed into law on december  which reauthorized tria for seven years  expanded the definition of an act of terrorism while expanding the private sector role and reducing the federal share of compensation for insured losses under the program 
the intent of this legislation is to provide federal assistance to the insurance industry for the needs of commercial insurance policyholders with the potential exposure for losses due to acts of terrorism 
the triea provides reinsurance for certified acts of terrorism 
effective january   we began to issue policy endorsements for all commercial policyholders to comply with tria after obtaining the commissioner s approval 
in addition to the above mentioned reinsurance programs and as described in more detail above under the massachusetts property and casualty insurance market  we are a participant in car  the massachusetts mandated residual market under which premiums  expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses on ceded business are shared by all insurers writing automobile insurance in massachusetts 
the personal automobile residual market mechanism is being phased out  as described earlier 
we also participate in the massachusetts property insurance underwriting association in which premiums  expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses on homeowners business that cannot be placed in the voluntary market are shared by insurers writing homeowners insurance in massachusetts 
the fair plan has grown dramatically over the past few years as insurance carriers have reduced their exposure to coastal property 
the fair plan s exposure to catastrophe losses increased and as a result  the fair plan decided to buy reinsurance to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses 
on july   the fair plan purchased  of catastrophe reinsurance for property losses in excess of  as of december   we had no material amounts recoverable from any reinsurer  excluding  recoverable from car 
on march   our board of directors the board adopted a resolution that prohibits safety from purchasing finite reinsurance reinsurance that transfers only a relatively finite or limited amount of risk to the reinsurer without approval by the board 
to date  the company has never purchased a finite reinsurance contract 

table of contents competition the property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
we compete with both large national writers and smaller regional companies 
our competitors include companies which  like us  serve the independent agency market  as well as companies which sell insurance directly to customers 
direct writers may have certain competitive advantages over agency writers  including increased name recognition  loyalty of the customer base to the insurer rather than to an independent agency and potentially  lower cost structures 
a material reduction in the amount of business independent agents sell would adversely affect us 
further  we and others compete on the basis of the commissions and other cash and non cash incentives provided to agents 
although historically  a number of national insurers that are much larger than we are have chosen not to compete in a material way in the massachusetts private passenger automobile market  if one or more of these companies decided to aggressively enter the market it could have a material adverse effect on us 
the commissioner announced that managed competition reforms were  in part  designed to make massachusetts more appealing to these companies 
since  new companies have entered the market including progressive insurance company  peerless a subsidiary of liberty mutual  aig  vermont mutual  preferred mutual  ids  occidental  geico  harleysville  foremost and allstate 
these companies include some that would be able to sustain significant losses in order to acquire market share  as well as others which use distribution methods that compete with the independent agent channel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies in the future 
our principal competitors within the massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market are commerce group  inc  liberty mutual including peerless and arbella insurance group  which held  and market shares based on automobile exposures  respectively  in according to car 
employees at december   we employed employees 
our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement 
management considers our relationship with our employees to be good 
investments investment income is an important source of revenue for us and the return on our investment portfolio has a material effect on our net earnings 
our investment objective is to focus on maximizing total returns while investing conservatively 
we maintain a high quality investment portfolio consistent with our established investment policy 
as of december   all securities in our fixed income securities portfolio were rated investment grade by moody s  except for two securities which represented of our portfolio and approximately of our portfolio which moody s does not rate 
we have no exposure to european sovereign debt 
according to our investment guidelines  no more than of our portfolio may be invested in the securities of any one issuer excluding us government backed securities 
this one issuer must be rated a or above by moody s 
in addition  no more than of our portfolio may be invested in securities of any one issuer rated baa  or the lowest investment grade assigned by moody s 
we continually monitor the mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in an attempt to maximize our total after tax return 
since  we have utilized the services of a third party investment manager 

table of contents the following table reflects the composition of our investment portfolio as of december  and as of december  estimated fair value of portfolio estimated fair value of portfolio us treasury securities obligations of states and political subdivisions residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities other asset backed securities corporate and other securities subtotal  fixed maturity securities equity securities other invested assets residential mortgage backed securities consists primarily of obligations of us government agencies including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities guaranteed and or insured by the following issuers government national mortgage association gnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the total of these fixed maturity securities was  and  at amortized cost and  and  at fair value as of december  and  respectively 
other asset backed securities includes obligations of the us small business administration which totaled  at amortized cost and  at estimated fair value at december  equity securities include interest in mutual funds of  and  at cost and  and  at fair value as of december  and  respectively 
the principal risks inherent in holding mortgage backed securities and other pass through securities are prepayment and extension risks  which affect the timing of when cash flows will be received 
when interest rates decline  mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities tend to be prepaid more rapidly than anticipated  causing early repayments 
when interest rates rise  the underlying mortgages tend to be prepaid at a slower rate than anticipated  causing the principal repayments to be extended 
although early prepayments may result in acceleration of income from recognition of any unamortized discount  the proceeds typically are reinvested at a lower current yield  resulting in a net reduction of future investment income 
in addition  in the current market environment  such investments can also contain liquidity risks 
equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices 
our exposure to changes in equity prices results from our holdings of common stock and mutual funds held to fund the executive deferred compensation plan 
we continuously evaluate market conditions and we expect in the future to purchase additional equity securities 
we principally manage equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques

net effective annual yield declined in to from in and in the and decreases primarily resulted from lower short term interest rates  risk reduction actions related to municipal bonds  and ongoing maintenance of short duration to protect the portfolio from rising interest rates 
as of december   our portfolio of fixed maturity investments was comprised entirely of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities  us government and agency securities  and asset backed securities  with the exception of two securities which represented less than of our total investment in fixed income securities 
all of our securities received a rating assigned by moody s of ba or higher  except the few securities not rated by moody s  all except one of which are rated investment grade by standard poor s 
such ratings are generally assigned upon the issuance of the securities and are subject to revision on the basis of ongoing evaluations

such ratings are generally assigned upon the issuance of the securities and are subject to revision on the basis of ongoing evaluations 
ratings in the table are as of the date indicated 
moody s rating system utilizes nine symbols to indicate the relative investment quality of a rated bond 
aaa rated bonds are judged to be of the best quality and are considered to carry the smallest degree of investment risk 
aa rated bonds are also judged to be of high quality by all standards 
together with aaa bonds  these bonds comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds 
bonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are considered to be upper medium grade obligations 
baa rated bonds are considered as medium grade obligations  they are neither highly

bonds rated ba or lower those rated b  caa  ca and c are considered to be too speculative to be of investment quality 
the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners the svo evaluates all public and private bonds purchased as investments by insurance companies 
the svo assigns one of six investment categories to each security it reviews 
category is the highest quality rating and category is the lowest 
categories and are the equivalent of investment grade debt as defined by rating agencies such as standard poor s ratings services and moody s  while categories are the equivalent of below investment grade securities 
svo ratings are reviewed at least annually 
at december   of our available for sale fixed maturity investments were rated category and were rated category  the two highest ratings assigned by the svo

prepayment rates are influenced by a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages or other collateral to changes in interest rates  a variety of economic  geographic and other factors  and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structures 
ratings am best  which rates insurance companies based on factors of concern to policyholders  currently assigns safety insurance an a excellent rating 
our a rating was reaffirmed by am best on march  such rating is the third highest rating of ratings that am best assigns to solvent insurance companies  which currently range from a superior to d very vulnerable 
publications of am best indicate that the a rating is assigned to those companies that in am best s opinion have a strong ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  as well as its book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated fair value of its assets  the adequacy of its loss reserves  the adequacy of its surplus  its capital structure  the experience and competence of its management and its market presence 
am best s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance company s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to purchasers of an insurance company s securities 
in assigning safety insurance s rating  am best recognized its solid risk adjusted capitalization and trend of strong operating income and market position as a leading personal automobile writer in 
table of contents massachusetts 
am best also noted among our positive attributes our low investment leverage  our disciplined underwriting approach  and our expertise in the closely managed massachusetts automobile insurance market  where rates  until recently  were historically established by the commissioner 
am best cited other factors that partially offset these positive attributes  including our concentration of business in the massachusetts private passenger automobile market which exposes our business to regulatory actions 
supervision and regulation introduction 
our principal operations are conducted through the insurance subsidiaries which are subject to comprehensive regulation by the division of insurance  of which the commissioner is the senior official 
the commissioner is appointed by the governor 
we are subject to the authority of the commissioner in many areas of our business under massachusetts law  including our licenses to transact insurance  the premium rates and policy forms we may use  our financial condition including the adequacy of our reserves and provisions for unearned premium  the solvency standards that we must maintain  the type and size of investments we may make  the prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices we must use  and the nature of the transactions we may engage in with our affiliates 
in addition  the commissioner periodically conducts a financial examination of all licensees domiciled in massachusetts 
we were most recently examined for the five year period ending december  the division had no material findings as a result of this examination 
insurance holding company regulation 
our principal operating subsidiaries are insurance companies  and therefore we are subject to certain laws in massachusetts regulating insurance holding company systems 
these laws require that we file a registration statement with the commissioner that discloses the identity  financial condition  capital structure and ownership of each entity within our corporate structure and any transactions among the members of our holding company system 
in some instances  we must provide prior notice to the commissioner for material transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and other affiliates in our holding company system 
these holding company statutes also require  among other things  prior approval of the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions and any acquisition of a domestic insurer 
insurance regulation concerning dividends 
we rely on dividends from the insurance subsidiaries for our cash requirements 
the insurance holding company law of massachusetts requires notice to the commissioner of any dividend to the shareholders of an insurance company 
the insurance subsidiaries may not make an extraordinary dividend until thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected in such time 
as historically administered by the commissioner  this provision requires the prior approval by the commissioner of an extraordinary dividend 
an extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution that  together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the greater of of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding december  or the insurer s net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
under massachusetts law  an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds  also known as its earned surplus  and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
at year end 
table of contents  the statutory surplus of safety insurance was  and its net income for was  a maximum of  will be available during for such dividends without prior approval of the commissioner 
acquisition of control of a massachusetts domiciled insurance company 
massachusetts law requires advance approval by the commissioner of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled in massachusetts 
that law presumes that control exists where any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing or more of our outstanding voting stock 
even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be deemed to have acquired control if the commissioner determines that control exists in fact 
any purchaser of shares of common stock representing or more of the voting power of our capital stock will be presumed to have acquired control of the insurance subsidiaries unless  following application by that purchaser the commissioner determines that the acquisition does not constitute a change of control or is otherwise not subject to regulatory review 
these requirements may deter  delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of our common stock  including transactions that could be advantageous to our stockholders 
protection against insurer insolvency 
massachusetts law requires that insurers licensed to do business in massachusetts participate in the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund insolvency fund 
the insolvency fund must pay any claim up to of a policyholder of an insolvent insurer if the claim existed prior to the declaration of insolvency or arose within sixty days after the declaration of insolvency 
members of the insolvency fund are assessed the amount the insolvency fund deems necessary to pay its obligations and expenses in connection with handling covered claims 
subject to certain exceptions  assessments are made in the proportion that each member s net written premiums for the prior calendar year for all property and casualty lines bore to the corresponding net written premiums for insolvency fund members for the same period 
as a matter of massachusetts law  insurance rates and premiums include amounts to recoup any amounts paid by insurers for the costs of the insolvency fund 
by statute  no insurer in massachusetts may be assessed in any year an amount greater than two percent of that insurer s direct written premium for the calendar year prior to the assessment 
we account for allocations from the insolvency fund as underwriting expenses 
car also assesses its members as a result of insurer insolvencies 
because car is not able to recover an insolvent company s share of the net car losses from the insolvency fund  car must increase each of its member s share of the deficit in order to compensate for the insolvent carrier s inability to pay its deficit assessment 
it is anticipated that there will be future assessments from time to time relating to various insolvencies 
the insurance regulatory information system 
the insurance regulatory information system iris was developed to help state regulators identify companies that may require special financial attention 
iris consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review annual statements and financial ratios 
the statistical phase consists of key financial ratios based on year end data that are generated annually from the database of the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
each ratio has an established usual range of results 
these ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
a ratio result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios is not considered a failing result  rather  unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system 
furthermore  in some years  it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges 
generally  an insurance company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios 
in  and all our ratios for all our insurance subsidiaries were within the normal range 

table of contents risk based capital requirements 
the naic has adopted a formula and model law to implement risk based capital requirements for most property and casualty insurance companies  which are designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations 
the risk based capital formula for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers underwriting  which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing  declines in asset values arising from market and or credit risk  and off balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience from non controlled assets  guarantees for affiliates or other contingent liabilities and reserve and premium growth 
under massachusetts law  insurers having less total adjusted capital than that required by the risk based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
the risk based capital law provides for four levels of regulatory action 
the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the level of total adjusted capital to risk based capital falls 
the first level  the company action level  as defined by the naic  requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the commissioner if total adjusted capital falls below of the risk based capital amount 
the regulatory action level  as defined by the naic requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and requires the commissioner to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if total adjusted capital falls below of the risk based capital amount 
the authorized control level  as defined by the naic  authorizes the commissioner to take whatever regulatory actions he or she considers necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer which may include the actions necessary to cause the insurer to be placed under regulatory control  ie  rehabilitation or liquidation  if total adjusted capital falls below of the risk based capital amount 
the fourth action level is the mandatory control level  as defined by the naic  which requires the commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control if total adjusted capital falls below of the risk based capital amount 
the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with higher levels of capital 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies 
at december   our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action at any prescribed risk based capital action level 
regulation of private passenger automobile insurance in massachusetts 
our principal line of business is massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance 
prior to april   regulation of private passenger automobile insurance in massachusetts differed significantly from how this line of insurance is regulated in other states 
in  the commissioner issued a series of decisions to introduce what she termed managed competition which removed many of the factors that had historically distinguished the massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market from the market in other states 
however  certain of the historically unique factors have not been eliminated  including compulsory insurance  affinity group marketing  and the prominence of independent agents 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the reform act was signed into law 
the reform act makes sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities  products and markets 
although the provisions of the bill do not appear to directly affect our business  as detailed regulations are developed to implement the provisions of the bill  there may be changes in the regulatory environment that affect the way we conduct our operations or the cost of compliance  or both

any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  and a corresponding decline in the market price of our common stock 
because we are primarily a private passenger automobile insurance carrier  our business may be adversely affected by conditions in this industry 
approximately of our direct written premiums for the year ended december   were generated from private passenger automobile insurance policies 
as a result of our focus on that line of business  negative developments in the economic  competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the private passenger automobile insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  these developments would have a disproportionate effect on us  compared to insurers which conduct operations in multiple business lines 
because we write insurance principally in massachusetts  our business may be adversely affected by conditions in massachusetts  including the potential effect of the commissioner s new managed competition 
almost all of our direct written premiums are currently generated in massachusetts 
our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions in massachusetts 
changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business 
massachusetts has recently enacted significant changes to the regulatory framework relating to private passenger automobile insurance 
these changes include rate competition and restructuring the private passenger automobile insurance residual market 
the commissioner intends that these changes will increase competition and result in lower premiums in private passenger automobile insurance in the state 
we cannot estimate how these regulatory changes will affect our private passenger automobile insurance business over the longer term 
adverse results could include loss of market share  decreased revenue  and or increased costs 
additional competitors have entered the market in response to these changes 
in addition  these developments could have a disproportionate effect on us  compared to insurers which conduct operations in multiple states 
we have exposure to claims related to severe weather conditions  which may result in an increase in claims frequency and severity 
we are subject to claims arising out of severe weather conditions  such as rainstorms  snowstorms and icestorms  that may have a significant effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in claims frequency and severity under the private passenger automobile insurance we write when severe weather occurs because a higher incidence of vehicular accidents and other insured losses tend to occur as a result of severe weather conditions 
in addition  we have exposure to an increase in claims frequency and severity under the homeowners and other property insurance we write because property damage may result from severe weather conditions 
because some of our insureds live near the massachusetts coastline  we also have a potential exposure to losses from hurricanes and major coastal storms such as nor easters 
although we purchase catastrophe reinsurance to limit our exposure to these types of natural catastrophes  in the event of a major catastrophe resulting in property losses to us in excess of  our losses would exceed the 
table of contents limits of this reinsurance in addition to losses from our quota share retention of a portion of the risk up to  climate change may adversely impact our results of operations 
there are concerns that the increase in weather related catastrophes and other losses incurred by the industry in recent years may be indicative of changing weather patterns 
this change in weather patterns could lead to higher overall losses which we may not be able to recover  particularly in light of the current competitive environment  and higher reinsurance costs 
climate change could also have an impact on issuers of securities in which we invest  resulting in realized and unrealized losses in future periods which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and or financial position 
if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents  it could adversely affect our business 
we market our insurance solely through independent agents 
we must compete with other insurance carriers for the business of independent agents 
some of our competitors offer a larger variety of products  lower prices for insurance coverage or higher commissions 
while we believe that the commissions and services we provide to our agents are competitive with other insurers  changes in commissions  services or products offered by our competitors could make it harder for us to attract and retain independent agents to sell our insurance products 
established competitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to market our products effectively and offer our products at a profit 
the property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
we compete with both large national writers and smaller regional companies 
further  our competitors include other companies which  like us  serve the independent agency market  as well as companies which sell insurance directly to customers 
direct writers may have certain competitive advantages over agency writers  including increased name recognition  loyalty of the customer base to the insurer rather than to an independent agency and  potentially  lower cost structures 
a material reduction in the amount of business independent agents sell would directly and negatively affect our profitability and our ability to compete with insurers that do not rely solely on the independent agency market to sell their products 
further  our company and others compete on the basis of the commissions and other cash and non cash incentives provided to agents 
although a number of national insurers that are much larger than we are do not currently compete in a material way in the massachusetts personal auto market  if one or more of these companies decided to aggressively enter the market it could reduce our share of the massachusetts market and thereby have a material adverse effect on us 
these companies include some that would be able to sustain significant losses in order to acquire market share  as well as others which use distribution methods that compete with the independent agent channel 
progressive corporation  geico and allstate  large insurers that market directly to policyholders rather than through agents  along with other carriers have entered the massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market 
we are unable to predict the long term effects on our business of the new managed competition regulatory environment 
as a holding company  safety insurance group  inc is dependent on the results of operations of the safety insurance company 
safety insurance group  inc is a company and a legal entity separate and distinct from safety insurance company  our principal operating subsidiary 
as a holding company without significant operations of its own  the principal sources of safety insurance group  inc s funds are dividends and other distributions from safety insurance company 
our rights to participate in any distribution of 
table of contents assets of safety insurance company are subject to prior claims of policyholders  creditors and preferred shareholders  if any  of safety insurance company except to the extent that our rights  if any  as a creditor are recognized 
consequently  our ability to pay debts  expenses and cash dividends to our shareholders may be limited 
the ability of safety insurance company to pay dividends is subject to limits under massachusetts insurance law 
further  the ability of safety insurance group  inc to pay dividends  and our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness or to use the proceeds of equity offerings  will be subject to limits under our revolving credit facility 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by massachusetts and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these regulations 
general regulation 
we are subject to regulation by government agencies in massachusetts  and we must obtain prior approval for certain corporate actions 
we must comply with regulations involving transactions between an insurance company and any of its affiliates  the payment of dividends  the acquisition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  approval or filing of premium rates and policy forms  solvency standards  minimum amounts of capital and surplus which must be maintained  limitations on types and amounts of investments  restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured by a single company  limitation of the right to cancel or non renew policies in some lines  regulation of the right to withdraw from markets or terminate involvement with agencies  requirements to participate in residual markets  licensing of insurers and agents  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  and reporting with respect to financial condition 
in addition  insurance department examiners from massachusetts perform periodic financial and market conduct examinations of insurance companies 
such regulation is generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders 
massachusetts requires that all licensed property and casualty insurers bear a portion of the losses suffered by some insureds as a result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies by participating in the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund insolvency fund 
members of the insolvency fund are assessed a proportionate share of the obligations and expenses of the insolvency fund in connection with an insolvent insurer 
these assessments are made by the insolvency fund to cover the cost of paying eligible claims of policyholders of these insolvent insurers  and by car  to recover the shares of net car losses that would have been assessed to the insolvent companies but for their insolvencies 
in addition  massachusetts has established an underwriting association in order to ensure that property insurance is available for owners of high risk property who are not able to obtain insurance from private insurers 
the losses of this underwriting association are shared by all insurers that write property and casualty insurance in massachusetts 
we are assessed from time to time to pay these 
table of contents losses 
the effect of these assessments could reduce our profitability in any given period and limit our ability to grow our business 
because we are unable to predict with certainty changes in the political  economic or regulatory environments in massachusetts in the future  there can be no assurance that existing insurance related laws and regulations will not become more restrictive in the future or that new restrictive laws will not be enacted and  therefore  it is not possible to predict the potential effects of these laws and regulations on us 
we may enter new markets and there can be no assurance that our diversification strategy will be effective 
although we intend to concentrate on our core businesses in massachusetts  we also may seek to take advantage of prudent opportunities to expand our core businesses into other states where we believe the independent agent distribution channel is strong 
as a result of a number of factors  including the difficulties of finding appropriate expansion opportunities and the challenges of operating in an unfamiliar market  we may not be successful in this diversification 
additionally  in order to carry out any such strategy we would need to obtain the appropriate licenses from the insurance regulatory authority of any such state 
on june   we applied for admission in the state of new hampshire for a certificate of authority to transact insurance business 
on october   the state of new hampshire insurance department issued a certificate of authority for property and casualty insurance to each of the insurance subsidiaries 
we began writing business in new hampshire late in our failure to maintain a commercially acceptable financial strength rating would significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
am best has currently assigned safety insurance an a excellent rating 
an a rating is am best s third highest rating  out of possible rating classifications for solvent companies 
an a rating is assigned to insurers that in am best s opinion have a strong ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
moreover  an a rating is assigned to companies that have  on balance  excellent balance sheet strength  operating performance and business profile when compared to the standards established by am best 
am best bases its ratings on factors that concern policyholders and not upon factors concerning investor protection 
such ratings are subject to change and are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities 
an important factor in an insurer s ability to compete effectively is its am best rating 
our am best rating is lower than those of some of our competitors 
any future decrease in our rating could affect our competitive position 
our losses and loss adjustment expenses may exceed our reserves  which could significantly affect our business 
the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses that we have established are estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the time we established the reserves 
reserves are based on historical claims information  industry statistics and other factors 
the establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
if our reserves are inadequate and are strengthened  we would have to treat the amount of such increase as a charge to our earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that our ultimate liability will not materially exceed our reserves and have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves  it has been necessary  and may over time continue to be necessary  to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in our reserves for claims and policy expenses 
the historic development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses may not 
table of contents necessarily reflect future trends in the development of these amounts 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies based on historical information 
if we lose key personnel  our ability to implement our business strategy could be delayed or hindered 
our future success depends significantly upon the efforts of certain key management personnel  including david f 
brussard  our chief executive officer and president 
we have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
brussard  begley  kerton  krupa  loranger  patrick  murphy  and berry  the eight members of our management team 
the loss of key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as we continue to grow  we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel  and our ability to do so will depend upon a number of factors  such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel 
market fluctuations and changes in interest rates can have significant and negative effects on our investment portfolio 
our results of operations depend in part on the performance of our invested assets 
as of december   based upon fair value measurement  of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed maturity securities in common equity securities and in other invested assets 
certain risks are inherent in connection with debt securities including loss upon default and price volatility in reaction to changes in interest rates and general market factors 
we have a significant investment portfolio and adverse capital market conditions  including but not limited to volatility and credit spread changes  will impact the liquidity and value of our investments  potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses 
values of our investments can also be impacted by reductions in price transparency and changes in investor confidence and preferences  potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses 
if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value  and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  we will be required to write down the value of our investments  which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition 
developments in the global financial markets may adversely affect our investment portfolio and overall performance 
global financial markets have recently experienced unprecedented and challenging conditions 
if conditions further deteriorate  our business could be affected in different ways 
continued turbulence in the us economy and contraction in the credit markets could adversely affect our profitability  demand for our products or our ability to raise rates  and could also result in declines in market value and future impairments of our investment assets 
we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements which could cause us to reduce our premiums written in certain lines or could result in losses 
in order to reduce risk and to increase our underwriting capacity  we purchase reinsurance 
the availability and the cost of reinsurance protection are subject to market conditions  which are outside of our control 
as a result  we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through these arrangements 
for example  if reinsurance capacity for homeowner s risks were reduced as a result of terrorist attacks  climate change or other causes  we might seek to reduce the amount of homeowners business we write 
in addition  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders 
a significant reinsurer s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents there are anti takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents and in laws of the state of delaware and the commonwealth of massachusetts that could impede an attempt to replace or remove our management or prevent the sale of our company  which could diminish the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and the laws of delaware contain provisions that may delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests 
for example  our organizational documents provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  prevent shareholders from taking action by written consent  prevent shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders  provide for supermajority voting requirements to amend our certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our bylaws and provide for the filling of vacancies on our board of directors by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office 
these provisions will render the removal of the incumbent board of directors or management more difficult 
in addition  these provisions may prevent shareholders from receiving the benefit of any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of a takeover attempt  the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
the massachusetts insurance law prohibits any person from acquiring control of us  and thus indirect control of safety insurance group  inc  without the prior approval of the commissioner 
that law presumes that control exists where any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing or more of our outstanding voting stock 
even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be deemed to have acquired such control if the commissioner determines that such control exists in fact 
therefore  any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face regulatory obstacles which could delay  deter or prevent an acquisition that shareholders might consider in their best interests 
section of the general corporation law of delaware  the jurisdiction in which the company is organized  may affect the ability of an interested stockholder to engage in certain business combinations including mergers  consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares  for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
an interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation 
future sales of shares of our common stock by our existing shareholders in the public market  or the possibility or perception of such future sales  could adversely affect the market price of our stock 
investors currently known to be the beneficial owners of greater than of our outstanding common stock hold approximately of the common stock of safety insurance group  inc on a fully diluted basis 
no prediction can be made as to the effect  if any  that future sales of shares by our existing shareholders  or the availability of shares for future sale  will have on the prevailing market price of our common stock from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing shareholders  or the possibility or perception that such sales could occur  could cause the prevailing market prices for our common stock to decrease 
if such sales reduce the market price of our common stock  our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets may be adversely affected 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our systems and business functions  including our information technology  telecommunications and other business systems 
our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not sufficiently address all contingencies 
our business is highly dependent upon our ability to execute  in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  necessary business functions  such as processing new and renewal business  providing customer 
table of contents service  and processing and paying claims 
a shut down of or inability to access our facility  a power outage  or a failure of one or more of our information technology  telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis 
if sustained or repeated  such a business interruption  systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration in the level of service we provide to our agents and policyholders 
we have established a business continuity plan in an effort to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic event 
while we continue to test and assess our business continuity plan to ensure it meets the needs of our core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events  there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event  which may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
if we experience difficulties with outsourcing relationships  our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted 
we outsource certain business and administrative functions to third parties and may do so increasingly in the future 
if we fail to develop and implement our outsourcing strategies or our third party providers fail to perform as anticipated  we may experience operational difficulties  increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
by outsourcing certain business and administrative functions to third parties  we may be exposed to enhanced risk of data security breaches 
any breach of data security could damage our reputation and or result in monetary damages  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition
