item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands  except per share data overview we are a global designer and manufacturer of custom engineered ejectors  vacuum systems  condensers  liquid ring pump packages and heat exchangers to the refining and petrochemical industries  and a nuclear code accredited supplier of components and raw materials to the nuclear power generating market 
our equipment is used in critical applications in the petrochemical  oil refining and electric power generation industries  including nuclear  cogeneration and geothermal plants 
our equipment can also be found in alternative energy  including ethanol  biodiesel and coal and gas to liquids  as well as other diverse applications  such as metal refining  pulp and paper processing  shipbuilding  the nuclear propulsion program of the us navy  water heating  refrigeration  desalination  soap manufacturing  food processing  pharmaceuticals  and heating  ventilating and air conditioning 
our corporate offices are located in batavia  new york and we have production facilities in both batavia  new york and at our wholly owned subsidiary  energy steel supply co  located in lapeer  michigan 
we also have a wholly owned foreign subsidiary  graham vacuum and heat transfer technology suzhou co  ltd  located in suzhou  china  which supports sales orders from china and provides engineering support and supervision of subcontracted fabrication 
on december   we acquired energy steel to advance our strategy to diversify our products and broaden our offerings to the energy industry 
this transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of energy steel were included in our consolidated financial statements and comparisons to our prior fiscal year will be enhanced by the inclusion of energy steel in this fiscal year s results

fiscal and the near term market conditions during fiscal  bidding activity remained active 
we believe the business environment is continuing to improve and that our customers are more inclined to procure the equipment needed for their projects 
this supports our belief that our oil refining  petrochemical and related markets are in the early stages of a business recovery 
while there continues to be uncertainty as to whether a sustained global economic recovery is occurring  we believe current signs such as order activity during our fourth quarter of fiscal continue to be more positive than in the past few years 
near term demand trends that we believe are affecting our customers investments include as the world recovers from the global recession  many emerging economies continue to have relatively strong economic growth 
this expansion is driving growing energy requirements and the need for more refined petroleum products 
although uncertainty in the capital and sovereign debt markets continues  there has been some improved access to capital  which has resulted in the release of certain previously stalled projects 
the expansion of the economies of oil producing middle eastern countries  their desire to extract greater value from their oil and gas resources  and the continued global growth in demand for oil and refined products has renewed investment activity in that region 
we do not believe that the ongoing political unrest in the middle east has impacted our business 
moreover  the planned timeline of refinery projects in the major middle eastern countries is encouraging 
asian countries  specifically china and india  are experiencing renewed demand for refined petroleum products such as gasoline 
this renewed demand is driving increased investment in petrochemical and 
table of contents refining projects 
although economic growth in asia appears to be moderating to a lower level  we believe that it remains a fast growing area and chinese and indian investments in refining  petrochemical and energy facilities appear to continue to be strong 
south america  specifically brazil  venezuela and colombia  is seeing increased refining and petrochemical investments that are driven by their expanding economies and increased local demand for gasoline and other products that are made from oil as the feedstock 
the us refining market has recently exhibited improvement  including demand in orders of short cycle and spare parts 
historically  these types of orders have suggested a recovery  as delayed spending is released 
we expect that the us refining markets will not return to the levels experienced during the last up cycle  but that such markets will improve compared with its levels over the past few years 
we also expect that the us refining markets will continue to be an important aspect of our business 
we are beginning to see renewed signs of planned investments in the us to convert greater percentages of crude oil to transportation fuels  such as revamping distillation columns to extract residual higher value components from the low value waste stream 
we are also seeing renewed investment to expand the flexibility of facilities to allow them to utilize multiple feed stocks 
investments  including foreign investments  in north american oil sands projects have recently increased  especially for extraction projects in alberta 
such investments suggest that downstream spending involving our equipment might increase in the next one to three years 
the recent dramatic change in natural gas costs in the us has led to a revival in the us petrochemical market and a recent interest toward potential major investment 
there are numerous projects in planning or initial engineering phases for the construction of new petrochemical producing facilities  including ethylene  ammonia and urea facilities 
we historically have had strong market share within these facilities 
proposed ethylene capacity expansion and re opening of mothballed facilities  in the us  as well as downstream products  are being discussed by petrochemical producers for the first time in well over a decade 
lower natural gas costs is a relatively recent phenomena  having occurred over the past three years and is driven by technology advancements in drilling  creating a significant increase in supply 
this has made the us production of raw material for ethylene  ethane which is a side product of natural gas production globally competitive with naphtha the alternative feedstock for ethylene used in most of the world 
we believe investment in us petrochemical markets could be significant 
although investment in new nuclear power capacity in the us and internationally may become subject to increased uncertainty due to political and social pressures  which were augmented by the tragic earthquake and tsunami that occurred in japan in march the need for additional safety and back up redundancies at the existing domestic nuclear plants could increase demand for energy steel s products in the near term 
investments in existing us nuclear plants to extend their operating life and add incremental capacity are expected to continue 
investment in new us nuclear reactor projects planned for the summer south carolina and vogtle georgia facilities suggest continued growth in the domestic nuclear market  although such growth may be slowed by the perceptions related to the fukajima accident in japan 
we expect that the consequences of these near term trends  and specifically projected expansion in petrochemical and oil refining that will most likely occur outside of north america  primarily in the growing asian and south american markets  will result in more pressure on our pricing and gross margins  as these markets historically provided lower margins than north american refining markets 
a counter to margin pressure from international markets may come from investments in new petrochemical capacity built in north america and the timing of such investments 
because of continued global economic and financial uncertainty and the risk associated with growth in emerging economies  we also expect that we will have continued volatility in our order pattern 
we continue to 
table of contents expect our new order levels to remain volatile  resulting in both strong and weak quarters 
as the chart below indicates  quarterly orders can vary significantly 
we believe that looking at our order level in any one quarter does not provide an accurate indication of our future expectations or performance 
rather  we believe that looking at our orders and backlog over a one to two year period provides a better measure of our business 
in the near future we expect to see smaller value projects than what we had seen during the last expansion cycle 
this will require more orders for us to achieve a similar revenue level and will adversely impact our ability to realize margin gains through volume leverage 
our quarterly order levels for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  are set forth in the table below 
logo mix shift expected stronger international growth in refining and chemical processing with domestic growth in nuclear power and us navy projects we expect growth in the refining and chemical processing markets to be driven by emerging markets 
we have also expanded our addressable markets through the acquisition of energy steel and our focus on us navy nuclear propulsion projects 
we believe our revenue opportunities during the near term will be equivalent between the domestic and international markets 
over the long term  we expect our customers markets to regain their strength and  while remaining cyclical  continue to grow 
we believe the long term trends remain strong and that the drivers of future growth include long term demand trends global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the next two decades  primarily in emerging markets 
this is expected to offset estimated flat to slightly declining demand in north america and europe 
in addition  an increased trend toward export supply of finished product from the middle east to north america and europe 
global oil refining capacity is projected to increase  and is expected to be addressed through new facilities  refinery upgrades  revamps and expansions 
increased demand is expected for power  refinery and petrochemical products  stimulated by an expanding middle class in asia and the middle east 
increased development of geothermal electrical power plants in certain regions is expected to address projected growth in demand for electrical power 

table of contents increased global regulations over the refining  petrochemical and nuclear power industries are expected to continue to drive requirements for capital investments 
more refineries are expected to convert their facilities to use heavier  more readily available and lower cost crude oil as a feedstock 
lower costs are expected to drive increased domestic use of natural gas in the us  as well as  the ability to export liquefied natural gas to serve other regions  since natural gas in the us is globally competitive with oil 
increased focus on safety and redundancy is anticipated in existing nuclear power facilities 
long term increased project development of international nuclear facilities is expected  despite the recent tragedy in japan  including in the us construction of new petrochemical plants in the middle east to meet local demand 
an expansion of the petrochemical market in the us  given the plentiful supply and globally competitive price of natural gas 
increased investments in new power generation projects are expected in asia and south america to meet projected consumer demand increases 
long term growth potential is believed to exist in alternative energy markets  such as geothermal  coal to liquids  gas to liquids and other emerging technologies  such as biodiesel  and waste to energy 
shale gas development and the resulting availability of affordable natural gas as feedstock to us based chemical petrochemical facilities is expected to lead to renewed investment in chemical petrochemical facilities in the us we believe that all of the above factors offer us long term growth opportunities to meet our customers expected capital project needs 
in addition  we believe we can continue to grow our less cyclical smaller product lines and aftermarket businesses 
our domestic sales as a percentage of aggregate product sales was in our fiscal year ended march  as the us market weakened  relative to international markets  domestic sales declined to of total sales in each of fiscal and in fiscal  domestic sales increased to  with the full year impact of energy steel and additional us navy work 
the navy activity represents our production of surface condensers for the cvn gerald r 
ford class nuclear carrier order that was won in q fiscal this project was in excess of million and is converting to revenue across multiple fiscal years 
results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales net income diluted income per share total assets 
table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  up  or  as compared with sales of  for fiscal the increase was driven by organic growth as well as the full year impact of our acquisition of energy steel

selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense for fiscal was  up compared with  in fiscal half of the increase in sg a was related to the full year impact of owning energy steel 
the remaining increase was due to the addition of staff to support current and future expected revenue growth 
sg a expense as a percentage of sales decreased in fiscal to of sales compared with of sales in fiscal interest income for fiscal was  down from in fiscal this decrease was due to lower average levels of cash during fiscal compared with fiscal interest expense was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the increase was due to the interest expense recognized related to the acquisition earn out reversing the discounting calculations made when estimating the payment of the earn out as well as interest charges for a research and development tax credit resolution with the irs and other unrecognized tax benefits

our gross margin for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross margin in fiscal was impacted by certain project wins  which occurred in late fiscal and early fiscal  during a period when pricing was extremely competitive due to the small number of available opportunities 
in addition  fiscal margins  especially in the first half of the year  benefitted from projects won late in the last up cycle 
gross profit for fiscal decreased  compared with fiscal gross profit decreased due to a lower gross margin  which was mostly offset by higher volume 
gross profit in fiscal was adversely impacted by inventory step up and intangible asset amortization related to the energy steel acquisition

amounts represent anticipated contributions during fiscal to our postretirement medical benefit plan  which provides healthcare benefits for eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees 
on february  
table of contents  we terminated postretirement healthcare benefits for our us employees 
benefits payable to retirees of record on april  remained unchanged 
we expect to be required to make cash contributions in connection with these plans beyond one year  but such amounts cannot be estimated 
no contributions are expected to be made to our defined benefit pension plan for fiscal net cash generated by operating activities for fiscal was  compared with net cash used of  for fiscal higher net income and deprecation combined  unbilled revenue  and inventory were partly offset by decreases in income taxes payable and accounts payable and an increase in accounts receivable 
capital spending in fiscal was  up from  in fiscal  as we invested in equipment to support our growth strategies 
capital expenditures in fiscal were for plant machinery and equipment and for all other items 
sixty three percent of our capital spending was for productivity improvements and the balance was primarily for capitalized maintenance 
we used to purchase shares of stock as part of our stock buyback program in fiscal  compared with in fiscal in addition  we paid in dividends in fiscal  up from in fiscal cash and investments were  on march  compared with  on march   down 
the largest components of cash usage in the year were income taxes and continued reductions  as planned  in customer deposits that were originally received in fiscal we invest net cash generated from operations in excess of cash held for near term needs in either a money market account or in us government instruments  generally with maturity periods of up to days 
our money market account is used to securitize our outstanding letters of credit and allows us to pay a lower cost on those letters of credit 
approximately of our cash and investments are held in the us the remaining is invested in our china operations 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between approximately  and  approximately of our fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be for machinery and equipment  with the remaining amounts to be used for information technology and other items 
our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na provides us with a line of credit of  including letters of credit and bank guarantees 
in addition  the agreement allows us to increase the line of credit  at our discretion  up to another  for total availability of  borrowings under our credit facility are secured by all of our assets 
letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility on march  and were  and  respectively 
there were no other amounts outstanding on our credit facility at march  and our borrowing rate as of march  was bank of america s prime rate  or 
availability under the line of credit was  at march  we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with our investments and available financing capacity under our credit facility  will be adequate to meet our cash needs for the immediate future 
orders and backlog orders in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal orders represent communications received from customers requesting us to supply products and services 
revenue is recognized on orders received in accordance with our revenue recognition policy included in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
domestic orders were  or  and international orders were  or  of our total orders in fiscal domestic orders increased by  or  primarily due to strong orders at energy steel 
orders at energy steel were  compared with  for the approximately months we owned energy steel in fiscal approximately half of this increase was related to winning two large orders to provide products for the new nuclear reactors to be built in the southeast us  while the remaining increase reflected our full fiscal year ownership of the company 
international orders increased by  or  as we experienced strong orders for the petrochemical market in the middle east and improved asian and south american order levels for the refining market 

table of contents backlog was a record  at march   up compared with  at march  backlog is defined by us as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
all orders in backlog represent orders from our traditional markets in established product lines 
approximately to of orders currently in backlog are not expected to be converted to sales within the next twelve months 
at march   approximately of our backlog was attributed to equipment for refinery project work  for power  including nuclear energy  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications including the order for the us navy 
at march   approximately of our backlog was for refinery project work  for power  including nuclear energy  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications 
at march   one project with a value of  was on hold 
the project was placed back on hold in the second quarter of fiscal this project was originally won in september  placed on hold in november and removed from hold by the customer in october although it had a scheduled delivery of december  it has now been placed back on hold by the customer 
outlook we believe that we are in the early stages of a recovery in the refinery and petrochemical markets 
we also believe the improved strength of the alternative energy markets  including the nuclear market  will continue into fiscal we experienced significant organic order growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with orders of  which was approximately double the average order level for each of the first three quarters 
we believe that with our strong project pipeline  we are likely to see higher quarterly order levels as compared with the first three quarters of fiscal  though not necessarily at the level achieved in the fourth quarter 
our backlog is at a record level of  we expect revenue to increase to to million  a gain of  in fiscal approximately  to of our revenue is expected to come from energy steel 
in fiscal  energy steel contributed of our revenue 
in fiscal  sales in the first half of the year were  while they decreased to  in the second half of the year 
in fiscal  we expect stronger sales in the second half of the year compared with the first half of the fiscal year 
normally  we convert to of our existing backlog to sales within a month period 
however  we have three large projects which are converting over a multi year time period 
although the us navy project and two large projects for the new nuclear reactors being built in the southeast us will partially convert in fiscal  we expect all three projects to continue into subsequent fiscal years 
these three projects make up approximately one third of our fiscal year end backlog 
therefore  our march  backlog will extend beyond our historical conversion level 
we expect to convert approximately to of our march  backlog to sales in fiscal for fiscal  we expect sales to be lower in the first half of the year than during the second half of the year 
this is a result of the lower level of orders received in the first three quarters of fiscal relative to the stronger fourth quarter orders achieved in fiscal our expected growth range for fiscal assumes conversion of backlog as well as continued market improvement and investment by our customers 
the upper end of the range may be achieved by acceleration of projects by refining and petrochemical and alternative energy end users  our historical customer base 
we believe increased focus on safety and redundancy projects at us nuclear facilities may provide near term opportunities at energy steel 
the us navy and two large nuclear projects are expected to contribute significantly to sales in fiscal any unexpected delay in any of these projects could impact fiscal revenue and earnings 
we expect gross profit margin in fiscal to be in the to range 
this margin level represents a decrease from fiscal  which included some higher margin projects  especially in the first two quarters of fiscal gross margin in the first half of fiscal was and in the second half of fiscal while we still have a few lower margin projects in our backlog  the overall margin within our backlog has improved over the past few quarters 
we expect gross margins in the first half of fiscal to be comparable to the second half of fiscal  with margin improvement in the second half of the fiscal year 
we are also seeing the current shift of business in the refining and petrochemical market toward international markets  where mar 
table of contents gins are generally lower than domestic project margins 
moreover  we are pre investing in operations and engineering personnel to prepare for current and future growth opportunities 
gross profit margins are expected to improve with anticipated volume increases throughout fiscal and beyond 
due to changes in geographic and end use market mix  we expect gross margins are unlikely to reach the range achieved in the prior up cycle 
we believe long term up cycle gross profit margin percentage in the mid to upper s is a more realistic expectation 
we also expect this recovery will continue to be more focused on emerging markets  which historically have lower margins and more competitive pricing than developed markets 
we believe achievement of the upper end of our margin projections can occur if we experience i increased volume that increases utilization of capacity  ii continued improvements in our manufacturing productivity  and or iii expanded margin opportunities at energy steel 
sg a spending during fiscal is expected to be between of sales 
we continue to pre invest in personnel as we prepare for increased opportunities in fiscal and beyond 
our effective tax rate during fiscal is expected to be between and 
cash flow in fiscal is expected to be positive  driven primarily by net income  partly offset by capital spending as well as a minimal need for additional working capital 
contingencies and commitments we have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos contained in our products 
we are a co defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
the claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant 
such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs places of work or were settled by us for amounts below expected defense costs 
neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the potential for liability can be determined at this time 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal proceedings and potential claims 
as of march   other than noted above  we were unaware of any other material litigation matters 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess of four weeks which approximates direct labor hours using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred as of a specific date to our estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated material and labor costs at completion 
losses on contracts are recognized immediately  when evident to management 
revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is recognized utilizing the completed contract method 
the majority of the contracts we enter into have a planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do not vary materially from the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is required throughout the construction process and we have no further material obligations under the contracts after the revenue is recognized 

table of contents business combinations and intangible assets 
assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based upon detailed valuations that use various assumptions made by management 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment if certain indicators are present 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value 
pension and postretirement benefits 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
we base the discount rate assumption for our plans on moody s or citigroup pension liability index aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of liabilities and assets measured using the enacted tax rate 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates 
we evaluate available information about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
the company files federal and state income tax returns in several domestic and international jurisdictions 
in most tax jurisdictions  returns are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities for a number of years after the returns have been filed 
during fiscal  the company reached a resolution with the us internal revenue service the irs with regard to the research and development tax credits claimed during tax years through as a result of the resolution  the tax credits claimed were reduced by approximately and interest was assessed on the underpayment of tax 
prior to the resolution  the company had recorded an unrecognized benefit for of the tax credit claimed  or the company recorded an additional unrecognized tax benefit of related to this resolution 
in fiscal  the irs completed its examination for tax years and and proposed an adjustment  plus interest  to disallow all of the research and development tax credits claimed by the company in those tax years 
the company filed a protest to appeal the adjustment 
in may  the company reached a resolution with the irs reducing the research and development tax credits claimed during tax years and by approximately 
the cumulative tax benefit related to the research and development tax credit for the tax years ended march  through march  and march  through march  was  and  respectively 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to this tax position was and at march  and  respectively  which represents management s estimate of the potential resolution of this issue 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and judgments we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to labor hour estimates used to recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method  fair value estimates of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations  accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
as discussed above under the heading critical accounting policies  we recognize a substantial amount of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the key estimate of percentage of completion accounting is total labor to be incurred on each contract and to the extent that this estimate changes  it may significantly impact revenue recognized in each period 
we base the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined using one of three valuation approaches market  income or cost 
the selection of a particular method for a given asset depends on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset 
the market approach values the asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets 
the income approach values the asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by that asset 
the projected cash flows are discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the transaction and the time value of money 
the projected cash flows for each asset considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  the high cost barrier to entry of markets  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
the cost approach values the asset by determining the current cost of replacing that asset with another of equivalent economic utility 
the cost to replace the asset reflects the replacement cost  less an allowance for loss in value due to deprecation or obsolescence  with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require us to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
for more information on these matters see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments 
the discount rate assumption for fiscal is for our defined benefit pension plan and for our other postretirement benefit plan 
a reduction in the discount rate of basis points  with all other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan by approximately and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of used in accounting for our pension plan is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns 
a reduction in the rate of return of basis points  with other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic pension expense by approximately as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our managers with functional responsibilities for financial  credit  tax  engineering  manufacturing and benefit matters  and outside advisors such as lawyers  consultants and actuaries 
we believe that the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 

table of contents we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k related to revenue  contingencies  pensions  other post retirement benefits and other matters requiring the use of estimates and judgments are reasonable  although actual outcomes could differ materially from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in the normal course of business  management evaluates all new accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec  the emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended its guidance related to the presentation of other comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires the presentation of other comprehensive income and its components either together with the components of net income in one continuous statement of comprehensive income or as a separate statement immediately following the statement of income with equal prominence 
the provisions of the amended guidance will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending march  management does not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements  which have not already been adopted  to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of march  or march   other than operating leases and letters of credit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from market changes to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates  price risk and project cancellation risk 
the assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate  price risk and project cancellation risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods  our current knowledge of the marketplace  and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
foreign currency international consolidated sales for fiscal were of total sales  down from of sales in fiscal operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies 
business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified 
in addition  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to us dollars 
in each of fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  all sales for which we or our subsidiaries were paid were denominated in the local currency us dollars or chinese rmb 
at certain times  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
we have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our purchases in foreign currencies represented of the cost of products sold 
at certain times  we may utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to limit currency exposure 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in fiscal or fiscal  and as of march  and  respectively  we held no forward foreign currency contracts 

table of contents price risk operating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which  in some instances  benefit from lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions 
although we believe that our customers differentiate our products on the basis of our manufacturing quality and engineering experience and excellence  among other things  such lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions mean that certain of our competitors are able to offer products similar to ours at lower prices 
moreover  the cost of metals and other materials used in our products have experienced significant volatility 
such factors  in addition to the global effects of the recent volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets  have resulted in downward demand and pricing pressure on our products 
project cancellation and project continuation risk economic conditions over the past few years have led to a higher likelihood of project cancellation by our customers 
at march   one project with a value of  was on hold 
this project was originally won in september  placed on hold in november and removed from being on hold by the customer in october the project was placed back on hold in the second quarter of fiscal although it had a scheduled delivery of december  it has been placed back on hold by the customer 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred 
as a result  we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled 
open orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers 
if it becomes evident to us that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date  management will move the project into placed on hold ie  suspended category 
furthermore  if a project is cancelled by our customer  it is removed from our backlog
