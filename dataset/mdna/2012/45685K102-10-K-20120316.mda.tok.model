infusystem holdings  inc results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues our revenue for the year ended december  was million  a increase compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues is primarily related to revenues generated by a full year of operations of first biomedical  acquired during  obtaining business at new customer facilities  as well as deeper penetration into existing customer facilities 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of compared to million in the prior year 
it represented of revenues in the current year compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily related to our requested change to an agreement with one of our pump manufacturers that transferred our ownership of all pumps and corresponding current rental customers to the pump manufacturer in exchange for a share of future revenues  which resulted in a million non cash write off of the transferred pumps 
there was also an increase as an overall percentage of revenue in pump sales and services  which generally have a lower gross profit margin  as compared to third party billings 
provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  it represented of revenues in the current year compared to in the prior year 
the decrease  as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of increased collection efforts and monitoring along with a change in patient and customer base due to a full year of operations with first biomedical in amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million  an increase compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily related to additional intangible assets associated with the acquisition of first biomedical  as well as amortization of new software 
asset impairment charges as of june   based on a combination of factors  including a decline in our market capitalization  updated business forecasts  and the expiration of our warrants  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment analysis 
for the purposes of the analysis performed during the second quarter of  our estimates of fair value were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  we recorded a million non cash asset impairment charge 

table of contents as of september   based on a significant decline in our market capitalization  we concluded that there was an additional indicator to require us to perform an interim goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment analysis and as a result  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
for the purposes of the analysis performed during the third quarter of  our estimates of fair value were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
accordingly  for the three months ended september   we recorded million for non cash asset impairment charges representing our best estimate of the loss 
based on the impairment analyses as described above  the following table outlines the impairment charges by asset category in thousands for the year ended december  asset goodwill trade names total impairment charges selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december   our selling and marketing expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses during these periods consisted of sales salaries  commissions and associated fringe benefit and payroll related items  marketing  share based compensation  travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses 
the increase in expenses is primarily related to expenses incurred through a full year of operations of the acquired first biomedical and increases in sales force 
as compared to the prior year  these expenses increased from to of revenues for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   our general and administrative expenses were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily related to a decrease in share based compensation and costs associated with the acquisition of first biomedical 
general and administrative expenses during these periods consisted primarily of administrative personnel salaries  fringe benefits and payroll related items  professional fees  share based compensation  insurance and other miscellaneous expenses 
general and administrative expenses have decreased from to of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
other income and expenses during the year ended december   we recorded a gain on derivatives of million  compared to a gain of million during the year ended december  included in the year ended december  was the gain from the expiration on april  of all remaining outstanding warrants to purchase common stock issued in connection with the ipo  whereas the year ended december  gain included an unrealized gain from the change in fair value of our warrants  a realized loss recorded in connection with the exchange of common stock for warrants  and a realized gain on the termination of an interest rate swap

gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of compared to million in the prior year 
it represented of revenues in the current year compared to in the prior year 
the decrease  as a percentage of revenues  is primarily related to higher pump depreciation and disposal costs  a higher mix of pump sales and services  including first biomedical  as compared to third party billings  partially offset by lower supplies costs

inflation management believes that there has been no material effect on our operations or financial condition as a result of inflation or changing prices of our ambulatory infusion pumps during the period from december  through december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the decrease in cash was primarily related to cash used for the acquisition of new pumps and repayment of long term debt  partially offset by positive cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  an increase in inventory  to satisfy the increased sales  accounts for million of the million decrease 
accounts receivable increased by million which was consistent with the increase in sales 
as identified above we recorded a non cash asset impairment expense of approximately million during the year ended december  this was offset in part by a change in deferred tax benefits of approximately million  as result of the impairment expense 
these items have no impact on cash  but are listed as reconciling items in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily related to cash paid for the acquisition of first biomedical  partially offset by a million increase in purchases of infusion pumps 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the change was primarily related to the increase in additional borrowings of million as a result of the refinancing in the remaining change was due to an increase in cash payments on long term debt of million and capital leases of million 
these were offset by a decrease in cash paid for debt issuance costs of million and an increase in cash paid for treasury shares of million 
management believes the current funds  together with expected cash flows from ongoing operations as well as the million available as of december  on the revolving credit facility from bank of america referred to below  are sufficient to fund our current operations 
on june   we entered into a credit facility with bank of america  na as administrative agent  and keybank national association as documentation agent 
the facility consists of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility  both of which mature in june interest on the term loan is payable at our choice of libor plus  or the bank of america prime rate plus 
as of december   interest was payable at libor plus  which equaled approximately 
proceeds from the new term loan were used to repay the outstanding balance of our debt held by kimberly clark i flow  as well as contribute to the acquisition consideration for first biomedical 
as of december  and  the company had a letter of credit in the amount of million outstanding  leaving million available on its revolving credit facility 
the bank of america term loan is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and requires us to comply with covenants principally relating to satisfaction of a total leverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and an annual limit on capital expenditures 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants and are projecting to remain in compliance for the year ended december  we are required to satisfy certain financial covenants on a quarterly and annual basis comprised of an interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio for the duration of the credit facility 

table of contents in connection with the credit facility  we have the following covenant obligations for the duration of the facility a the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in accordance with the agreement governing the credit facility and has a minimum ratio at december  of the required ratio for the remainder of the facility duration is b the leverage ratio is calculated in accordance with the agreement governing the credit facility and has a maximum ratio at december  of the required ratio varies quarterly for the remainder of the facility duration  from to c the credit facility includes an annual limitation on capital expenditures in accordance with the agreement governing the credit facility that were million for the year ended december  the limitation varies annually for the remainder of the facility duration from million to million 
contractual obligations as of december   future payments related to contractual obligations are as follows in thousands payment due by period less than year to years to years more than years total debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the table above does not include any interest payments associated with our variable rate term debt 
for more information  refer to the discussion under debt and other long term obligations included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
included in the operating lease obligations are future minimum lease payments as of december  under various lease agreements we have entered into for office space 
contingent liabilities we do not have any contingent liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto 
we consider critical accounting policies to be those that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  including the following revenue recognition  which includes contractual allowances  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  warrants and derivative financial instruments  income taxes  and goodwill valuation 
management relies on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable in making its judgment and estimates 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

table of contents management believes its application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described under the heading summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments revenue recognition we recognize revenue for selling  renting and servicing new and pre owned infusion pumps and other medical equipment to oncology practices as well as other alternate site settings including home care and home infusion providers  skilled nursing facilities  pain centers and others  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement is determined to exist  and collectability is reasonably assured  when we receive a physician s written order and assignment of benefits  signed by the physician and patient  respectively  and we have verified actual pump usage and we receive patient acknowledgement of assignment of benefits 
we recognize rental revenue from electronic infusion pumps as earned  normally on a month to month basis 
pump rentals are billed at our established rates  which often differ from contractually allowable rates provided by third party payors such as medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance carriers 
all billings to third party payors are recorded net of provision for contractual adjustments to arrive at net revenues 
we perform an analysis to estimate sales returns and record an allowance 
this estimate is based on historical sales returns 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
due to continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that management s estimates could change in the near term  which could have an impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
our largest payor is medicare  which accounted for approximately of our gross billings for the year ended december  we have contracts with various individual blue cross blue shield affiliates which in the aggregate accounted for approximately of our gross billings for the year ended december  no individual payor  other than medicare and the blue cross blue shield entities accounts for greater than of our gross billings 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and other direct pay customers for goods provided and services rendered 
we perform periodic analyses to assess the accounts receivable balances and record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the estimated collectability of the accounts such that the recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
upon determination that an account is uncollectible  the account is written off and charged to the allowance 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that could become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management s assessment of historical and expected net collections by payor 
due to continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement it is possible that management s estimates could change in the near term  which could have an impact on its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 

table of contents following is an analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts for infusystem holdings  inc for the years ended december   and in thousands balance at beginning of period acquired in acquisition charged to costs and expenses deductions balance at end of period allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts deductions represent the write off of uncollectible account receivable balances 
warrants and derivative financial instruments on april   we consummated our initial public offering ipo of million units 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and two redeemable common stock purchase warrants 
each warrant entitles the holder to purchase from us one share of our common stock at an exercise price of 
on may   we sold an additional million units the overallotment units to ftn midwest securities corp  the underwriter of our ipo ftn midwest  pursuant to a partial exercise by ftn midwest of its overallotment option 
the warrant agreement provides for us to register the shares underlying the warrants in the absence of our ability to deliver registered shares to the warrant holders upon warrant exercise 
the accounting guidance requires freestanding derivative contracts that are settled in a company s own stock  including common stock warrants  to be designated as equity instruments  assets or liabilities 
under the provisions of this standard  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at its fair value on a company s balance sheet  with any changes in fair value recorded in the company s results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no fair value adjustments are required from period to period 
on february   we announced an offer to exchange common stock for outstanding warrants 
at the time  we had million outstanding warrants 
the exchange offer expired on march  holders of our warrants had the option to exchange their warrants for either one share of common stock for every thirty five warrants tendered  or one share of common stock for every twenty five warrants tendered  provided the recipient agreed to be subject to a lock up provision precluding transfer of the shares of common stock received for six months following the expiration of the exchange offer 
the lock up provision expired in september based on the final count  million warrants were properly tendered  million were tendered for shares of common stock subject to a lock up  and million were tendered for unrestricted shares of common stock 
under the terms of the exchange offer  we issued an aggregate million shares of common stock in exchange for the tendered warrants 
after the exchange  there were million publicly held warrants and million privately held warrants outstanding 
the million remaining warrants issued in connection with the ipo and overallotment to purchase common stock expired on april   and we recorded a realized gain of million  which is included on the gain in derivatives line item on the income statement  during the year ended december  cash flow hedge we are exposed to risks associated with future cash flows related to the variability of the interest rate on its term loan with bank of america 
in order to manage the exposure of these risks  we enter into interest rate swaps 
on july   we entered into a single interest rate swap and designated the swap as a cash flow hedge 
the fair value of the swap is presented on our consolidated balance sheet within derivative liabilities  unrealized changes in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within the stockholders equity section on our consolidated balance sheet  and any realized changes would be included in our consolidated statement of operations within interest expense 

table of contents income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax expense benefit results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized 
for more information  refer to the income taxes discussion included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles valuation goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired 
we apply a fair value based impairment test for our single reporting unit to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite lived assets on an annual basis and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
the analysis of potential impairments of goodwill requires a two step process 
the first step is an estimation of fair value of the company 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
impairment exists when the fair value of goodwill or indefinite lived assets is less than the carrying value 
as of june   based on a combination of factors  including a decline in our market capitalization  updated business forecasts  and the expiration of our warrants  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment analysis 
for the purposes of the analysis performed during the second quarter of  our estimates of fair value were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  we recorded a million non cash asset impairment charge 
as of september   based on a significant decline in our market capitalization  we concluded that there was an indicator to require us to perform an additional interim goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment analysis 
for the purposes of the analysis performed during the third quarter of  our estimates of fair value were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  for the three months ended september   we recorded million for non cash asset impairment charges representing our best estimate of the loss 
for more information  refer to the goodwill and intangible assets discussion included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
