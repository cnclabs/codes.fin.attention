item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of part ii of this annual report on form k relating to liquidity and capital resources may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date they are made 
we disclaim any obligation  except as specifically required by law and the rules of the securities and exchange commission  to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based  or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed below and within this annual report on form k  as well as the accuracy of our internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of our risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and related notes thereto 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a weak global economy and softening in the computer software market may result in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth rates the profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the financial services markets and other markets in which we compete 
tighter credit and negative financial news resulting from the recent worldwide recession and  in the u 
s  from the potential combination of federal income tax increases and government spending restrictions that may occur at the end of calendar year in the absence of congressional action to delay or offset these actions commonly referred to as the fiscal cliff  may continue to have an adverse affect on the market for computer software and result in significant fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
if ultimately realized  the fiscal cliff would likely negatively impact global economic activity  including possibly sending the us into a new recession 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers  poor economic conditions may soften the demand for computer software and services which may result in decreased revenues  lower revenue growth rates and reduced profitability 
in addition  a weak global economy may result in longer sales cycles  reduced  deferred or cancelled orders  or greater than anticipated uncollectible accounts receivables 
in a weakened economy  we cannot be assured that we will be able to effectively promote future growth in our software and services revenues or maintain profitability 
our dependence on our principal products and our failure to develop enhanced or new products may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations in the year ended september   our information optimization products accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
we are primarily dependent on our information optimization products 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of any of these products could have a material adverse effect on us 
our future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of new and enhanced versions of these products and development of new versions of these and other products and subsequent customer acceptance of such new and enhanced products 
in addition  competitive pressures or other factors may result in significant price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations our future operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter because of uncertainties and or risks associated with such matters as current economic conditions  technological change  competition  delays in the introduction of new products or product enhancements and general market trends 
in addition  as we focus on increasing enterprise sales  the timing of significant orders may cause fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
large enterprise sales arrangements often involve multiple elements and may require more complex accounting than the sales transactions we have entered into in the past  which also makes projecting future operating results more difficult 
historically  we have operated with minimal backlog of orders because our software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
further  any increases in sales under our subscription sales model or cloud offering could result in decreased revenues over the short term 
because our staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our costs are fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
because of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we can give no assurance that we will not experience such variations in operating results in the future or that such variations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the sales cycle for our enterprise products is long and unpredictable  particularly with respect to large customers  and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense our operating results may fluctuate  in part  because of the resource intensive nature of our sales efforts  the length and variability of the sales cycle of our enterprise software licensing offerings and the short term difficulty in adjusting our operating expenses 
our operating results depend in part on sales to large customers and conversions of users that have downloaded the desktop version of our monarch professional software into enterprise customers 
the length of our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of and payment for the software license  varies substantially from customer to customer 
it is difficult to predict exactly when  or even if  we will make a sale with a potential customer or if a user that has licensed desktop versions of our monarch professional software will upgrade to a larger enterprise license 
as a result  large individual sales may  in some cases  occur in quarters subsequent to those we anticipate  or not at all 
the loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could impact our operating results for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is delayed 
as a result of these factors  it is difficult for us to forecast our revenues accurately in any quarter 
because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  our operating results will suffer if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the market for our information optimization products is emerging and may not grow the market for our information optimization products that allow organizations to analyze their businesses at an enterprise level by leveraging structured  unstructured  and semi structured data is still emerging 
it is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewal rates  customer demand for our enterprise software licenses  the size and growth rate of this market  the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products 
any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors  including the cost  performance and perceived value associated with such software licenses 
if the market for our enterprise software licenses does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for software in this market caused by a lack of customer acceptance  technological challenges  competing technologies and products  decreases in corporate spending  weakening economic conditions  or otherwise  it could result in reduced customer orders  early terminations  reduced renewal rates or decreased revenues  any of which would adversely affect our business operations and financial results 
dependence on new product introductions and new product delays or defects could have a material adverse effect on our business the market for information optimization products is newly emerging and evolving rapidly 
growth in our business depends in substantial part on the continuing introduction of new products to address the emerging needs of this market 
the length of product life cycles depends in part on end user demand for new or additional functionality in our products and our ability to update our products to meet such demands 
if we fail to accurately anticipate the demand for  or encounter any significant delays in developing or introducing  new products or additional functionality in our products  there could be a material adverse effect on our business 
product life cycles can also be affected by suppliers of operating systems introducing new or changed functionality within their products 
our failure to anticipate the introduction of additional functionality in products developed by such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our competitors may introduce products with more features and lower prices than our products 
such increase in competition could adversely affect the life cycles of our products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 
software products  whether developed internally or licensed from third parties  may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by us and by current and potential end users  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the market price of our stock has been and may continue to be volatile as seen recently with the turmoil in the financial markets  and is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
in addition  insiders presently hold a significant percentage of our stock  and our shares are thinly traded in the public market 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating companies acquired by us  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock 
even though we do not presently provide forecasts of our future financial performance  any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
finally  to maintain our stock listing with nasdaq  we must be in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rules 
if we are not able to maintain compliance with these rules  and if our common stock does not qualify for  or is subsequently delisted from  the nasdaq capital market  investors may have difficulty converting their investment into cash efficiently 
the price of our common stock and the ability of holders to sell such stock would be adversely affected 
a significant percentage of our total revenue is subject to risks associated with international sales in the years ended september   and  international sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
we have recently expanded our presence in europe and in asia pacific  including the opening of an office in singapore  and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue 
a significant portion of our total revenue will therefore be subject to risks associated with international sales  including further deterioration of international economic conditions  unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  currency exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  possible effects of war and acts of terrorism  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse foreign tax consequences 
past and future acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention historically  we have acquired certain technology or businesses to supplement and expand our product offerings 
in the future  we could acquire additional products  technologies or businesses  or enter into joint venture arrangements  for the purpose of complementing or expanding our business and to address the need to develop new products 
acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving and maintaining the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies business is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
there may be limitations on the effectiveness of our controls our management does not expect that our internal controls will prevent all errors 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues  if any  within our company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and no assurance can be given that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or intentional conduct may occur and not be detected 
we face significant competition in the software industry the software market is highly competitive and characterized by continual change and improvement in technology 
several of our existing and potential competitors  including splunk  actuate xenos  informatica  nuance and others  have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than we do 
no assurance can be given that we will have the resources required to compete successfully in the future 
our success is dependent on proprietary software technology our success is dependent upon proprietary software technology 
we do not own patents on any such technology and we rely principally on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our rights to such proprietary technology 
despite such precautions  there can be no assurance that such steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of such technology 
we may not be able to hire and retain highly skilled employees  which could affect our ability to compete effectively because our business is technology based qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly technical personnel and product development and professional services personnel  sales and marketing personnel and other senior personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are integral to our product development  professional services and sales and marketing teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
we have hired a number of key executives during the past two years  including our chief executive officer and key executives in sales and marketing functions 
a loss of these personnel or other changes in key management could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec regulations as well as the listing standards of the nasdaq stock market  have created and are continuing to create uncertainty for public companies 
we continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs incurred or the timing of such costs 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we have invested resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards 
this investment has and may continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and we may be harmed 
the failure of indirect distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we sell a significant portion of our products through distributors and resellers  none of which are under our direct control 
the loss of major distributors or resellers of our products  or a significant decline in their sales  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we have terminated our arrangement with ingram micro  inc effective in march and we consolidated our use of indirect distribution channels with a single distributor  lifeboat distribution  which accounted for  and of our total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
ingram accounted for  and of our total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain qualified distributors or resellers or that lifeboat distribution or any other distributors or resellers will be able to effectively sell our products  including the volume of products previously sold by ingram micro  inc we seek to select and retain distributors and resellers on the basis of their business credentials and their ability to add value through expertise in specific vertical markets or application programming expertise 
in addition  we may rely on resellers to provide post sales service and support  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect our business 
failure to maintain an adequate sales returns reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations revenue from the sale of all our software products when separately sold is generally recognized at the time of shipment 
we estimate and maintain reserves for potential future product returns from distributors based on our experience and history with our various distributors and resellers as well as by monitoring inventory levels at such companies 
while actual returns have historically been within the range estimated by management  future actual results could differ from the reserve for sales returns recorded  and this difference could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our subscription sales model for our enterprise products could result in decreased or delayed revenues and cash flows we sell our enterprise products through the sale of perpetual licenses and through a subscription pricing model 
the subscription pricing model allows customers to use our products at a lower initial cost of software acquisition when compared to the more traditional perpetual license sale 
although the subscription sales model is designed to increase the number of enterprise solutions sold and also reduce dependency on short term sales by building a recurring revenue stream  it introduces increased risks for us primarily associated with the timing of revenue recognition and reduced cash flows 
the subscription model delays revenue recognition when compared to the typical perpetual license sale and also  as we allow termination of certain subscriptions with days notice  it could result in decreased revenue for solutions sold under the model if we experience a high percentage of subscription cancellations following the first months of the subscription 
further  as amounts due from customers are invoiced over the life of the subscription  there are delayed cash flows from subscription sales when compared to perpetual license sales 
if our security measures are breached or other unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained  our software may be perceived as not being secure  customers may reduce the use of or stop using our software  and we may incur significant liabilities our software may involve the storage and transmission of customer data  and security breaches could result in the loss of this information  litigation  indemnity obligations and other liability 
while we have taken steps to protect the confidential information that we have access to  including confidential information we may obtain through our customer support services or customer usage of our products  we do not have the ability to monitor or review the content that our customers store  and therefore  we have no direct control over the substance of that content 
therefore  if customers use our software for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable information and our security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance or otherwise  our reputation could be damaged  our business may suffer  and we could incur significant liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and increase engagement by existing customers  cause existing customers to elect to not renew their subscriptions  or subject us to third party lawsuits  regulatory fines or other action or liability  thereby adversely affecting our financial results 
we may require additional capital to grow our business  and our financing arrangements expose us to interest rate risk our business may require additional capital to operate and expand 
we have historically relied upon cash generated from operations and bank credit lines to satisfy our capital needs and finance growth 
if we determine in the future to make significant investments in our business  including by acquiring assets or businesses from third parties  we may attempt to raise additional funds by securing additional debt financing or selling equity securities in either the public or the private markets 
as the financial markets change and new regulations come into effect  the cost of acquiring financing and the methods of financing may change 
we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional equity financing  our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the value of shares of our common stock could decline 
if we engage in debt financing  we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to make acquisitions 
our inability to do any of the foregoing could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital  or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our needs 
our current credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit our ability to borrow or limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities or conditions 
these financing instruments involve variable rate debt  thus exposing us to risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
such fluctuations in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our business 
catastrophic events may adversely affect our business our company is a highly automated business which relies on its network infrastructure and enterprise applications  internal technology systems and website for development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major storm  earthquake  fire  telecommunications failure  cyber attack  terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  reputational harm  delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and services and other critical functions of our business

critical accounting policies in the preparation of financial statements and other financial data  management applies certain accounting policies to transactions that  depending on judgments made by management  can result in different outcomes 
in order for a reader to understand the following information regarding the financial performance and condition of the company  an understanding of those accounting policies is important 
certain of those policies are comparatively more important to the company s financial results and condition than others 
the policies that the company believes are most important for a reader s understanding of the financial information provided in this report are described below 
revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts and returns reserve the company licenses its software products directly to end users  through value added resellers and through distributors 
sales to distributors and resellers accounted for approximately  and  of total sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue from the sale of all software products when separately sold is generally recognized at the time of shipment  provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and there are no significant obligations remaining 
both types of the company s software product offerings are off the shelf as such term is customarily defined 
the company s software products can be installed and used by customers on their own with little or no configuration required 
multi user licenses marketed by the company are sold as a right to use the number of licenses  and the license fee revenue is recognized upon delivery of all software required to satisfy the number of licenses sold 
upon delivery  the licensing fee is payable without further delivery obligations to the company 
datawatch software products are generally sold in multiple element arrangements which may include software licenses  professional services and post contract customer support 
in such multiple element arrangements  the company applies the residual method in determining revenue to be allocated to the software license 
in applying the residual method  the company deducts from the sale proceeds the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the professional services and post contract customer support in determining the residual fair value of the software license 
the vsoe of fair value of the services and post contract customer support is based on the amounts charged for these elements when sold separately 
professional services include implementation  integration  training and consulting services with revenue recognized as the services are performed 
these services are generally delivered on a time and materials basis  are billed on a current basis as the work is performed  and do not involve modification or customization of the software or any other unusual acceptance clauses or terms 
post contract customer support is typically provided under a maintenance agreement which provides technical support and rights to unspecified software maintenance updates and bug fixes on a when and if available basis 
revenue from post contract customer support services is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of support generally one year 
such deferred amounts are recorded as part of deferred revenue in the company s consolidated balance sheets included herein 
the company also licenses its enterprise software using a subscription model 
at the time a customer enters into a binding agreement to purchase a subscription  the customer is invoiced for an initial day service period and an account receivable and deferred revenue are recorded 
beginning on the date the software is installed at the customer site and available for use by the customer  and provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition are met  the deferred revenue amount is recognized ratably over the period the service is provided 
the customer is then invoiced every days and revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the subscription 
the subscription arrangement includes software  maintenance and unspecified future upgrades including major version upgrades when and if available 
the subscription renewal rate is the same as the initial subscription rate 
subscriptions can be cancelled by the customer at any time by providing days written notice following the first year of the subscription term 
the company s software products are sold under warranty against certain defects in material and workmanship for a period of days from the date of purchase 
the company also offers a day money back guarantee on its monarch product sold directly to end users 
additionally  the company provides its distributors with stock balancing rights 
revenue from the sale of software products to distributors and resellers is recognized at the time of shipment providing all other criteria for revenue recognition as stated above are met and i the distributor or reseller is unconditionally obligated to pay for the products  including no contingency as to product resale  ii the distributor or reseller has independent economic substance apart from the company  iii the company is not obligated for future performance to bring about product resale  and iv the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
the company s experience and history with its distributors and resellers allows for reasonable estimates of future returns 
among other things  estimates of potential future returns are made based on the inventory levels at  and the returns history with  the various distributors and resellers  which the company monitors frequently 
once the estimates of potential future returns from all sources are made  the company determines if it has adequate returns reserves to cover anticipated returns and the returns reserve is adjusted as required 
adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenue in the period of adjustment 
actual returns have historically been within the range estimated by the company 
the company s returns reserves were  and  as of september  and  respectively 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable  the company records an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
income taxes the company has deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that expire at different times through and until at september   the company had us federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately million  expiring at various dates through  including  resulting from the mergence acquisition undertaken during which are subject to additional annual limitations as a result of the changes in mergence s ownership  and had approximately million in state tax loss carryforwards  which also expire at various dates through an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately  is available to offset future regular federal taxes 
research and development credits of approximately  expire beginning in in addition  the company has the following foreign net operating loss carryforwards united kingdom losses of million with no expiration date  australia losses of million with no expiration date and germany losses of  with no expiration date 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
factors such as future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  changes in enacted tax rates and the period over which the company s deferred tax assets will be recoverable are considered in making these determinations 
management does not believe the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized and therefore a full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets at september  and management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and  if current economic conditions change or future results of operations are better than expected  future assessments may result in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are realizable 
if this conclusion were reached  the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be reduced resulting in a tax benefit being recorded for financial reporting purposes 
total net deferred tax assets subject to the full valuation allowance were approximately million as of september  the company follows the accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions 
the comprehensive model addresses the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
in accordance with these requirements  the company first determines whether a tax authority would more likely than not sustain its tax position if it were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information 
for those tax positions that meet this threshold  the company measures the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that the company has a greater than chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
the company maintains a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of its uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis  but the evaluation of the company s tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because  in certain cases  tax law is subject to varied interpretation  and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain 
the actual outcome of the company s tax positions  if significantly different from its estimates  could materially impact the financial statements 
at october   the company had a cumulative tax liability of  related to foreign tax exposure

capitalized software development costs the company capitalizes certain software development costs as well as purchased software upon achieving technological feasibility of the related products 
software development costs incurred and software purchased prior to achieving technological feasibility are charged to engineering and product development expense as incurred 
commencing upon initial product release  capitalized costs are amortized to cost of software licenses using the straight line method over the estimated life of the product which approximates the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  which is generally to months 
the net amount of capitalized software development costs was approximately  and  at september  and during fiscal  the company capitalized approximately  of software development costs related to products developed in fiscal year valuation of intangible assets and other long lived assets on march   the company acquired the intellectual property underlying its monarch professional and datawatch data pump products for a purchase price of  and capitalized approximately  in closing costs and adjustments 
the intellectual property assets are being amortized to cost of software licenses using the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset  which is five years 
other intangible assets consist of internally developed software  patents and customer lists acquired through business combinations 
the values allocated to these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
the company reviews all of its intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever an indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of the company s long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
no impairment charges were taken for intangible assets during fiscal year accounting for share based compensation the company recognizes share based compensation expense in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require that all share based awards  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value at date of grant

for the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded share based compensation expense of approximately  in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the company uses an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
the company believes this approach results in a reasonable estimate of volatility 
no stock options were granted during the fiscal year ended september  for the most recent stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended september   the company used an expected stock price volatility of based upon the historical volatility at the time of issuance 
with regard to the expected option life assumption  the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting  realizable value and short time to maturity effect 
for the most recent stock option grants issued during the year ended september   the company used an expected option life assumption of years 
with regard to the forfeiture rate assumption  the company reviews historical voluntary turnover rates 
for the most recent stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended september   the company used an annual estimated forfeiture rate of 
additional expense will be recorded if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated  and a recovery of prior expense will be recorded if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
the company also periodically grants awards of restricted stock units rsu to each of its non employee directors and some of its employees on a discretionary basis pursuant to its stock compensation plans 
each rsu entitles the holder to receive  at the end of each vesting period  a specified number of shares of the company s common stock 
each rsu vests at the rate of on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date 
additionally  some of the rsus are subject to a further vesting condition that the company s common stock must trade at prices greater than certain minimum per share prices on a national securities exchange for a period of twenty consecutive days prior to the fourth or fifth anniversary of the grant date depending on the grant 
for such rsus  the company applies the monte carlo option pricing model for determining the fair value on the date of grant
