our inability to select the new joint venture partner for borgata and the possibility that a new operating agreement will be entered into with the new venture partner  which could result in changes to borgata s ongoing operations 
the risk that we may be unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  including cost overruns on any particular project  as well as other capital expenditures through cash flow  borrowings under our amended credit facility or borgata s bank credit facility  as amended  and additional financings  which could jeopardize our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts

table of contents item a 
risk factors the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our securities  including our common stock  senior notes and senior subordinated notes  as well as borgata s senior secured notes  could decline significantly  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
we encourage investors to also review the risks and uncertainties relating to our business contained in part i  item  business important information regarding forward looking statements 
risks related to our business our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy 
consumer demand for entertainment and other amenities at casino hotel properties  such as ours  are particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities 
changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions  effects of the current decline in consumer confidence in the economy  including the current housing  employment and credit crisis  the impact of high energy and food costs  the increased cost of travel  the potential for continued bank failures  decreased disposable consumer income and wealth  or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer  thus imposing practical limits on pricing and negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  the year ended december  was one of the toughest economic periods in las vegas locals history 
the current housing crisis and economic slowdown in the united states has resulted in a significant decline in the amount of tourism and spending in las vegas 
similarly  weak economic conditions have also adversely affected tourism and spending in atlantic city  where borgata is located 
since our business model relies on consumer expenditures on entertainment  luxury and other discretionary items  continuation or deepening of the economic downturn will further adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
intense competition exists in the gaming industry  and we expect competition to continue to intensify 
the gaming industry is highly competitive for both customers and employees  including those at the management level 
we compete with numerous casinos and hotel casinos of varying quality and size in market areas where our properties are located 
we also compete with other non gaming resorts and vacation destinations  and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses  and could compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in the future 
the casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size  quality of facilities  number of operations  brand identities  marketing and growth strategies  financial strength and capabilities  level of amenities  management talent and geographic diversity 
in most markets  we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas 
in some markets  we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas 
in recent years  with fewer new markets opening for development  competition in existing markets has intensified 
we have invested in expanding existing facilities  developing new facilities  and acquiring established facilities in existing markets 
in addition  our competitors have also invested in expanding their existing facilities and developing new facilities 
this expansion of existing casino entertainment properties  the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we compete  and this intense competition can be expected to continue 
in addition  competition may intensify if our competitors commit additional resources to aggressive pricing and promotional activities in order to attract customers 
if our competitors operate more successfully than we do  if they attract customers away from us as a result of aggressive pricing and promotion  if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees  if their properties are enhanced or expanded  if they operate in jurisdictions that give them operating advantages due to differences or changes in gaming regulations or taxes  or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business  we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees 
in particular  the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  our business may be adversely impacted by the additional gaming and room capacity in states which may be competitive in the other markets where we operate or intend to operate 
several states are also considering enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino like operations in their jurisdictions 
for example  the expansion of casino gaming in or near the mid atlantic region from which borgata attracts and expects to attract most of its customers has had an adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in january  
table of contents table game legislation was signed into pennsylvania law which allows up to table games at each of the twelve largest authorized casinos and up to table games at each of the remaining two smaller authorized casinos 
table games became operational at the existing casinos in the philadelphia region in mid july in addition  other states near new jersey  including new york and delaware  either have or are currently contemplating gaming legislation 
in january  delaware legalized table games  which became operational in june at all three delaware casinos 
convenience may be a more important factor than amenities for some customers  especially mid week and repeat customers 
these customers may prefer the convenience of a closer drive to a nearby casino rather than dealing with a longer drive to enjoy the amenities that borgata has to offer 
expansion of gaming facilities in pennsylvania and other nearby states therefore has resulted in fewer customer visits to borgata  which has adversely impacted borgata s business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands 
expansion of native american gaming in areas located near our properties  or in areas in or near those from which we draw our customers  could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
for example  increased competition from federally recognized native american tribes near blue chip and sam s town shreveport has had a negative impact on our results 
native american gaming facilities typically have a significant operating advantage over our properties due to lower gaming taxes  allowing those facilities to market more aggressively and to expand or update their facilities at an accelerated rate 
although we have expanded our facility at blue chip in an effort to be more competitive in this market  competing native american properties could continue to have an adverse impact on the operations of both blue chip and sam s town shreveport 
the global financial crisis and decline in consumer spending may have an effect on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot accurately predict 
the significant economic distress affecting financial institutions has had  and may continue to have  far reaching adverse consequences across many industries  including the gaming industry 
volatility in the financial markets and the weakened global economy  together with the recent downgrade of the united states credit rating and ongoing european debt crisis  have contributed to the current uncertain economic climate 
the ongoing credit and liquidity crisis has greatly restricted the availability of capital and has caused the cost of capital if available to be much higher than it has traditionally been 
therefore  we have no assurance that we will have further access to credit or capital markets at desirable times or at rates that we would consider acceptable  and the lack of such funding could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  including our ability to refinance our or borgata s indebtedness  our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and our ability or willingness to fund new development projects 
we are not able to predict the duration or severity of economic downturns or the resulting impact on the solvency or liquidity of our lenders 
if a large percentage of our lenders were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations to us  we may not have the liquidity under our amendment and restatement agreement  our first amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of may   as amended by the first amendment and consent to first amended credit agreement  dated as of december  as amended  the amended credit facility to fund our current projects 
there is no certainty that our lenders will continue to remain solvent or fund their respective obligations under our amended credit facility 
if we were otherwise required to renegotiate or replace our amended credit facility  there is no assurance that we would be able to secure terms that are as favorable to us  if at all 
we may incur impairments to goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  or long lived assets 
in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs 
we perform the annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of each fiscal year 
the results of our annual scheduled impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets did not require us to record an impairment charge during the year ended december  however  as discussed below  if our estimates of projected cash flows related to these assets are not achieved  we may be subject to a future impairment charge  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to our annual scheduled impairment test  in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative guidance for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we test certain long lived assets for impairment if a triggering event occurs 
during the first quarter of  we performed an interim impairment test of the trademark in connection with the valuation of borgata  due to our consideration of a change in facts and circumstances surrounding an adverse change in the business climate in the atlantic city region 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to the trademark 
we are entirely dependent upon our properties for future cash flows and our continued success depends on our ability to draw customers to our properties 
significant negative industry or economic trends  reduced estimates of future cash flows  disruptions to our business  slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business have resulted in significant write downs and impairment charges during the years ended december  and if one or more of such negative events were to recur  additional impairment charges may be required in future periods 
if we are required to record additional impairment charges  this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in august  due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at that time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market 
as we do not believe that a significant level of economic recovery has occurred along the las vegas strip  or that financing for a development project like echelon is currently available on terms satisfactory to us  we do not expect to resume construction of echelon for three to five years 
the change in circumstances implies that the carrying amounts of the assets related to echelon may not be recoverable  therefore  we performed an impairment test of these assets during the years ended december    and we initially performed this evaluation during the year ended december   when the continued suspension was announced and have reconsidered our assumptions on a regular basis since such date 
however  due to the degradation in economic conditions in the intervening period since  we have performed these analyses during the year ended december  to evaluate any further depression in real estate or land values as well as any deterioration in our initial cash flow assumptions 
the outcome of this evaluation did not result in an impairment of echelon s assets  as the estimated weighted net undiscounted cash flows from the project exceed the current carrying value of the assets of approximately billion at both december  and as we further develop and explore the viability of alternatives for the project  we will continue to monitor these assets for recoverability 
if we are subject to a non cash write down of these assets  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
due to the circumstances regarding the final development plan of echelon  we reviewed our former investment in morgans lv investment llc morgans  a joint venture with morgans hotel group co  for impairment during the year ended december  considering the subsequent mutual termination of this joint venture  certain of our contributions  primarily related to the architectural and design plans  were ultimately not realizable and  as a result  we recorded an other than temporary non cash impairment charge of million during the year ended december  related to such costs 
in addition  during the year ended december   in conjunction with an amendment to the dania jai alai purchase agreement to settle the contingent payment prior to the satisfaction of the legal conditions  we recorded the remaining million of the million contingent liability as an additional cost of the acquisition by increasing goodwill 
we tested the goodwill for recoverability  which resulted in a noncash impairment charge of million during the year ended december  our partner in the holding company  the limited liability company that owns and operates borgata hotel casino and spa in atlantic city  new jersey  has divested its interest and we do not have the ability to select the new partner 
we own a controlling interest in the limited liability company that operates borgata 
mgm currently beneficially owns the other interest 
as a result of the new jersey department of gaming enforcement s the njdge investigation of mgm s relationship with its joint venture partner in macau  mgm entered into a settlement agreement with the njdge and the new jersey casino control commission the njccc under which mgm placed its ownership interest in borgata the mgm interest into a divestiture trust the divestiture trust  which was established for the purpose of selling the mgm interest to a third party 
we are the managing member of the limited liability company that operates borgata  and have been  and will continue to be responsible for the day to day operations of borgata  including the operations and improvement of the facility and business 
additionally  we hold a right of first refusal on any sale of the mgm interest in borgata 
however  we believe we will expend managerial resources to effectuate the eventual sale of the mgm interest from the divestiture trust to a new partner  regardless of whether we exercise our right of first refusal 
other than exercising our right of first refusal  we generally do not have the ability to affect the selection of the potential new partner at borgata 
while we believe we will retain direct control of the operations of borgata  based on our current operating agreement  a new partner may want to negotiate greater rights or different terms 
if we agree to consider changes to the operating agreement  these negotiations may decrease our ability to directly control the facility and effectively manage our financial risk 
any new partner could have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals 
the ongoing operation of the facility could change if we agree to negotiate agreements with a new partner that contain terms that differ from our existing operating agreement 
in addition  borgata s bank credit facility  as amended  matures in august at the time of maturity  if borgata is unable to refinance its bank credit facility on favorable terms  additional credit support and or capital contributions in the form of equity may be necessary to fund the ongoing operations of borgata 
this additional credit and or equity may need to be contributed by us or a new partner  if any  or from both 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be 
table of contents unable to meet the operating cash flow needs of borgata  and our investment would be at risk 
moreover  if any new partner does not have the financial resources to meet its share of the obligations  or subsequently declares bankruptcy  we could be required to fund more than our share 
we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets  through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities 
for example  in october  we consummated the acquisition of the ip 
in february  we completed the barbary coast exchange transaction 
in january  we completed the hotel construction project at blue chip 
we may also pursue expansion opportunities  including joint ventures  in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
the expansion of our operations  whether through acquisitions  development or internal growth  could divert management s attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs  including legal  professional and consulting fees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  acquire  develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for our new projects or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved 
ballot measures or other voter approved initiatives to allow gaming in jurisdictions where gaming  or certain types of gaming such as slots  was not previously permitted could be challenged  and  if such challenges are successful  these ballot measures or initiatives could be invalidated 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that there will not be similar or other challenges to legalized gaming in existing or current markets in which we may operate or have development plans  and successful challenges to legalized gaming could require us to abandon or substantially curtail our operations or development plans in those locations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in august  due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at that time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market 
as we do not believe that a significant level of economic recovery has occurred along the las vegas strip  or that financing for a development project like echelon is currently available on terms satisfactory to us  we do not expect to resume construction of echelon for three to five years 
we can provide no assurances as to when  or if  construction will resume on echelon  or if we will be able to obtain alternative sources of financing for the project 
we can provide no assurances regarding the timing or effects of our delay of construction at echelon and when  or if  construction will recommence  or the effect that such delay will have on our business  operations or financial condition 
in addition  our agreements or arrangements with third parties could require additional fees or terms in connection with modifying their agreements that may be unfavorable to us  and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to reach agreement on any modified terms 
there can be no assurance that we will not face similar challenges and difficulties with respect to new development projects or expansion efforts that we may undertake  which could result in significant sunk costs that we may not be able to fully recoup or that otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our expansion and development of echelon resorts may face significant risks inherent in construction projects 
we regularly evaluate expansion  development  investment and renovation opportunities 
on january   we announced our planned las vegas strip development  echelon  which represents the largest and most expensive development project we have undertaken to date 
this project and any other development projects we may undertake will be subject to the many risks inherent in the expansion or renovation of an existing enterprise or construction of a new enterprise  including unanticipated design  construction  regulatory  environmental and operating problems and lack of demand for our projects 
our current and future projects could also experience delays and significant cost increases  shortages of materials  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  poor performance or nonperformance by any of our joint venture partners or other third parties on whom we place reliance  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental  permitting  construction or geological problems  
table of contents and weather interference  floods  fires or other casualty losses 
the completion dates of any of our projects could differ significantly from expectations for construction related or other reasons 
in addition  actual costs and construction periods for any of our projects can differ significantly from initial expectations 
our initial project costs and construction periods are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared at inception of the project in consultation with architects and contractors 
many of these costs can increase over time as the project is built to completion 
we have incurred significant incremental costs in connection with delaying construction of echelon and anticipate that additional cost increases could continue to occur if and when we recommence development of echelon 
additional costs upon restarting construction of echelon could include  without limitation  costs associated with remobilization  changes in design  increases in material  labor  or insurance costs  construction code changes during the delay period  corrosive damage risk  damage to uncompleted structures  etc 
the cost of any project may vary significantly from initial budget expectations and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate funding is available 
we can provide no assurance that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets  or that any project will result in increased earnings to us 
significant delays  cost overruns  or failures of our projects to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects may face significant risks inherent in construction projects or implementing a new marketing strategy  including receipt of necessary government approvals 
certain permits  licenses and approvals necessary for some of our current or anticipated projects have not yet been obtained 
the scope of the approvals required for expansion  development  investment or renovation projects can be extensive and may include gaming approvals  state and local land use permits and building and zoning permits 
unexpected changes or concessions required by local  state or federal regulatory authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of the facilities 
we may not obtain the necessary permits  licenses and approvals within the anticipated time frames  or at all 
in addition  although we design our projects to minimize disruption of our existing business operations  expansion and renovation projects require  from time to time  all or portions of affected existing operations to be closed or disrupted 
for example  to make way for the development of echelon  we closed stardust in november and demolished the property in march any significant disruption in operations of a property could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
lve is a joint venture between marina energy llc and dco ech energy  llc 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  echelon resorts  we have entered into an esa with lve  to design  build  own other than the underlying real property which is leased from echelon resorts and operate a central energy center and related distribution system for our planned echelon resort development 
pursuant to the esa  lve will provide chilled and hot water  electricity and emergency electricity generation to echelon and potentially other joint venture entities associated with the echelon development project or other third parties 
however  since we are obligated to purchase substantially all of the output of the central energy center  we are the primary beneficiary under the terms of the esa 
lve has suspended construction of the central energy center while the echelon project is delayed 
on april   lve notified us that  in its view  echelon resorts would be in breach of the esa unless it recommenced and proceeded with construction of the echelon development project by may  we believe that lve s position is without merit  however  in the event of litigation  we cannot state with certainty the eventual outcome nor estimate the possible loss or range of loss  if any  associated with this matter 
on march   echelon resorts and lve entered into both a purchase option agreement the purchase option agreement and a periodic fee agreement the periodic fee agreement 
under the periodic fee agreement  echelon resorts and lve have mutually agreed that neither lve nor echelon resorts would give notice of  file or otherwise initiate any claim or cause of action  in or before any court  administrative agency  arbitrator  mediator or other tribunal  that arises under the esa  subject to certain exceptions  and that any statute of limitations or limitation periods for defenses  claims  causes of actions and counterclaims shall be tolled while the periodic fee agreement is in effect 
the prohibition on the initiation of litigation and the tolling of the statute of limitations provided for in the periodic fee agreement should be applicable to any litigation with respect to lve s april  claim of an alleged breach of the esa 
under the periodic fee agreement  echelon resorts has agreed to pay lve  beginning march   the periodic fee and an operation and maintenance fee until either i echelon resorts notifies lve that it has resumed construction of a portion of the echelon development project that it will own in fee simple and echelon resorts and lve have mutually agreed to changes to the dates in their respective construction milestones under the esa or ii 
table of contents echelon resorts exercises its option to purchase lve s assets pursuant to the terms of the purchase option agreement 
the amount of the periodic fee is fixed at million annually through november thereafter  the amount of the periodic fee is estimated to be approximately million annually 
the operation and maintenance fee cannot exceed million per annum without echelon resorts prior approval 
we have posted a letter of credit in the amount of million to secure echelon resorts obligation to pay the periodic fee and the operation and maintenance fee 
under the purchase option agreement  echelon resorts has the right  at its sole discretion  upon written notice to lve  to purchase the assets of lve including the central energy center and related distribution system for a price of million  subject to certain possible adjustments 
the esa will be terminated concurrent with the purchase of lve s assets 
if we are unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as other capital expenditures  through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our amended credit facility and additional financings  our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized 
we intend to finance our current and future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as our other capital expenditures  primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our amended credit facility  and equity or debt financings 
if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  or our other capital expenditures  we will have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or abandoning planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  forgoing any future distribution of dividends  obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners  or modifying our amended credit facility 
these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
in the past few years there have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital 
we anticipate that these disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that funding for any of our expansion projects would come from cash flows from operations and availability under our amended credit facility to the extent that availability exists under our amended credit facility  as applicable  after we meet our working capital needs 
if availability under our amended credit facility does not exist or we are otherwise unable to make sufficient borrowings thereunder  any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
as a result  if we are unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for projects  limit the scope of  or defer such projects  or cancel the projects altogether 
in the event that capital markets do not improve and we are unable to access capital with more favorable terms  additional equity and or credit support may be necessary to obtain construction financing for the remaining cost of the project 
risks related to the regulation of our industry we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  as well as federal  state and local laws affecting business in general  which may harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
regulatory authorities at the federal  state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming or other licenses  impose substantial fines and take other actions  any one of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a more detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is included in exhibit to our registration statement on form s filed with the sec on september   which in incorporated herein by reference 
if additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate  such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 
from time to time  various proposals are introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that  if enacted  could adversely affect the tax  regulatory  operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company 
regulation of smoking each of new jersey and illinois has adopted laws that significantly restrict  or otherwise ban  smoking at our properties in those jurisdictions 
the new jersey and illinois laws that restrict smoking at casinos  and similar legislation in other jurisdictions in which we operate  could materially impact the results of operations of our properties in those jurisdictions 
additionally  on april   an ordinance in atlantic city became effective which extended smoking restrictions under the new jersey smoke free air act 
this ordinance mandated that casinos restrict smoking to designated areas of up to of the casino floor 
during april  atlantic city s city council unanimously approved an amendment to the ordinance  banning smoking entirely on all casino gaming floors and casino simulcasting areas  but allowing smoking in separately exhausted  non gaming  smoking lounges 
the amendment to the ordinance became effective on october   however  on october  
table of contents atlantic city s city council voted to postpone the full smoking ban for at least one year due to  among other things  the weakened economy and increased competition in adjoining states 
the postponement of the full smoking ban became effective on november  in december  atlantic city s city council announced that it would not consider a full smoking ban in casinos pending further review 
regulation of directors  officers  key employees and partners our directors  officers  key employees and joint venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state regulatory authorities 
if state regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position or a joint venture partner unsuitable  we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may be required to dispose of their interest 
state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors  officers  key employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with applicable standards 
certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions that we are party to also require the approval of some state regulatory authorities 
regulations affecting businesses in general in addition to gaming regulations  we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages  environmental matters  smoking  employees  currency transactions  taxation  zoning and building codes  and marketing and advertising 
such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future  or new laws and regulations could be enacted 
for example  nevada recently enacted legislation that eliminated  in most instances  and  for certain pre existing development projects such as echelon  reduced  property tax breaks and retroactively eliminated certain sales tax exemptions offered as incentives to companies developing projects that meet certain environmental green standards 
as a result  we  along with other companies developing projects that meet such standards  may not realize the full tax benefits that were originally anticipated 
we are subject to extensive taxation policies  which may harm our business 
the federal government has  from time to time  considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future 
in addition  gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees  in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
for example  in june  the illinois legislature passed certain amendments to the riverboat gambling act  which affected the tax rate at par a dice 
the legislation  which imposes an incremental tax on adjusted gross gaming revenues  was retroactive to july  as a result of this legislation  we were required to pay additional taxes  resulting in a million tax assessment in june nevada use tax refund claims on march   the nevada supreme court issued a decision in sparks nugget  inc vs 
the state of nevada department of taxation the department  holding that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals was exempt from use tax 
as a result of this decision  refund claims were filed for use tax paid  over the period november through may  on food purchased for subsequent use in complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 
we estimate the refund to be in the range of million to million  including interest 
in  the department audited and denied our refund claim while simultaneously issuing a million sales tax deficiency assessment  plus interest of million 
we appealed both the denial of the refund claim as well as the deficiency assessment in a hearing before the nevada administrative law judge judge in september in april  the judge issued a split decision  granting a refund on employee meals and applying a sales tax measure on complimentary meals  however  the ruling barred retroactive application of the sales tax measure to all years in the refund claim period  effectively overturning the department s deficiency assessment 
both we and the department appealed the decision to the nevada state tax commission the commission 
on august   the commission remanded the case back for a second administrative hearing  which was held on september   to allow for the introduction of additional supporting documentation 
the judge issued a decision on november   reversing her position on the employee meal refund claim while also affirming the denial of the complimentary meal refund  as well as the denial of a retroactive application of the sales tax measure to both employee and complimentary meals 
the judge s decision was affirmed in a commission hearing on january  on february  we filed a petition for judicial review in clark county district court 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of our appeal to district court  as well as subsequent appeals to higher levels of the state judicial system  we will not record any gain until both we and the department have exhausted all appeal options and a final  non appealable decision has been rendered 
for periods subsequent to may  we have not collected  remitted or accrued a liability for sales tax on complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties  as we do not believe it is probable  based on both procedural issues and the technical merits of the department s arguments  that we will owe this tax 
blue chip property taxes 
table of contents blue chip has previously received a valuation notice from the county assessor indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  in december  we received the property tax bill related to our tax assessment in the amount million  which we appealed  and  in february  we received a notice of revaluation  which reduced the initial tax assessment by approximately million 
since then  we have made the minimum required payment against the provisional bills related to the years from through  all of which were based on the valuation notice 
during the year ended december   we reached settlements with the county assessor  reducing the annual valuation for years through based on these settlements  we revised our cumulative property tax accrual to reflect the retrospective effect of the revised valuations 
the impact of these revisions to the valuations resulted in a reduction of our property tax accrual of approximately million  which was cumulatively reversed through property tax expense during the year ended december  although we have not received valuation notices for years and  or final tax rates for the years through  we believe the assessments for the period from january  through december  could result in a total property tax obligation ranging between million and million 
we have accrued  net of the payment of the minimum requirements discussed above  approximately million for this property tax liability as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely outcome within our range  once all valuations have been received and all tax rates have been finalized  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated amount accrued will approximate the actual amount billed 
the final tax assessment notices for the period january  through december   which have not been received as of december   could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip 
new jersey income taxes atlantic city casinos  including borgata  currently pay a effective tax rate on gross gaming revenues 
we also pay property taxes  sales and use taxes  payroll taxes  franchise taxes  room taxes  parking fees  various license fees  investigative fees and our proportionate share of regulatory costs 
our profitability depends on generating enough revenues to pay gaming taxes and other largely variable expenses  such as payroll and marketing  as well as largely fixed expenses  such as property taxes and interest expense 
borgata is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and therefore federal income taxes are the responsibility of its members 
casino partnerships in new jersey  however  are subject to state income taxes under the casino control act 
therefore  borgata is required to record new jersey state income taxes 
we cannot assure you that the state of new jersey will not enact legislation that increases gaming tax rates 
increase in taxation if there is any material increase in state and local taxes and fees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we own real property and are subject to extensive environmental regulation  which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities 
we may incur costs to comply with environmental requirements  such as those relating to discharges into the air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of our property affected by hazardous substances 
under these and other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our property 
as an owner or operator  we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage  personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination 
these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants 
the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility 
the costs of investigation  remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial  and the presence of those substances  or the failure to remediate a property properly  may impair our ability to use our property 
borgata is a participant in a multiemployer pension plan  and the plan has been certified in critical status by the fund s actuary 
in connection with borgata s collective bargaining agreement with the culinary and hotel workers union  local unite here  it participates in the unite here national retirement fund pension plan the fund 
on march   as a result of the extraordinary decline in the financial markets and downturn in the economy  the fund was certified in critical status by the fund s actuary under the federal multiemployer plan funding laws pursuant to the pension protection act of the ppa 
in connection with the certification  the fund s board of trustees has adopted a rehabilitation plan effective on april  the rehabilitation plan with the goal of enabling the fund to emerge from critical status by january  the rehabilitation plan provides for certain increases in employer contributions and  in some cases  a reduction in participant benefits 
on may   borgata agreed upon a schedule with local unite here pursuant to which it began making increased monthly contributions to the fund on october  borgata s current monthly pension contributions to the fund range from million to million  and its unfunded vested liability to the fund is million for the plan year beginning on january  a renewed economic decline could have a 
table of contents significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the fund  which may require borgata to make contributions in addition to those already contemplated 
any such increases in required contributions could adversely affect borgata s results of operations 
additionally  in connection with borgata s collective bargaining agreements with the local engineers union pension plan and the nj carpenters pension fund  it participates in other multiemployer pension plans that have been certified in critical status under the federal multiemployer plan funding laws pursuant to the ppa 
the boards of trustees of these plans have adopted rehabilitation plans and borgata is currently in discussions with the boards regarding its level of participation in the rehabilitation plans 
the impact of the rehabilitation plans is not expected to have a material adverse effect on borgata s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
borgata s current monthly pension contributions to the funds associated with these plans is approximately less than million per month in the aggregate 
borgata s aggregate unfunded vested liability to these funds is approximately million 
under applicable federal law  any employer contributing to a multiemployer pension plan that completely ceases participating in the plan while it is underfunded is subject to payment of such employer s assessed share of the aggregate unfunded vested benefits of the plan 
in certain circumstances  an employer can also be assessed withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan 
based on an estimate provided by the fund in april  borgata has estimated that its pre tax withdrawal  assuming a hypothetical immediate and complete withdrawal from the fund  could be in excess of million 
in addition  borgata estimates the pre tax withdrawal liability for the other funds to which it contributes to be approximately million 
however  the exact amount of potential exposure could be higher or lower than the estimate  depending on  among other things  the nature and timing of any triggering events and the funded status of the fund  or other funds to which it contributes  at that time 
risks related to our properties we own facilities that are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions 
extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations  damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas 
for example  due to flooding of the mississippi river  the mississippi gaming commission ordered the nine casinos located in tunica  mississippi to close indefinitely to ensure the safety of visitors and employees 
accordingly  effective may   we closed sam s town hotel and gambling hall in tunica 
we were able to reopen on may   however  sam s town hotel and gambling hall suffered minor damage  and we are still negotiating a settlement with our insurer 
in addition  certain of our properties have been forced to close due to hurricanes 
in august  treasure chest was closed for eight days over labor day weekend due to hurricane gustav 
in september  treasure chest was closed for two days as a result of hurricane ike and in the property was closed for days as a result of hurricane katrina 
delta downs was closed for six days in august due to hurricane gustav and seven days in september due to hurricane ike 
in  delta downs suffered significant property damage as a result of hurricane rita and closed for days 
in september  borgata was closed for days due to hurricane irene 
moreover  blue chip  par a dice  sam s town tunica  sam s town shreveport  treasure chest and borgata are each located in an area that has been identified by the director of the federal emergency management agency fema as a special flood hazard area  which  according to the fema statistics  has a chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation a year flood in any given year 
in addition to the risk of flooding and hurricanes  snowstorms and other adverse weather conditions may interrupt our operations  damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected area 
for example  during january and february  much of the country was impacted by some of the worst winter weather in decades  particularly in the midwest 
although our properties at blue chip and par a dice were not closed as a result  these storms made it very difficult for our customers to visit  and we believe such winter weather had a material and adverse impact on the results of our operations during such time 
additionally  february was the snowiest month ever recorded in atlantic city  which generally kept would be gamblers from traveling to borgata  contributing to a drop in borgata s monthly revenues from january to february 
the winter season was the worst on record  and travel throughout the entire northeast was extremely difficult 
the residual impact from these record winter storms resulted in day trip visitations to atlantic city that were reduced or delayed as regional school calendars were extended in order to make up for prior school closures 
additionally  extreme heat and low precipitation levels in the second quarter of  particularly in the month of june  had an adverse impact on visitation and spending at borgata s property 
if there is a prolonged disruption at borgata or any of our other properties due to natural disasters  terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
while we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs and loss of revenue that we incur as a result of some 
table of contents extreme weather conditions  our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect  if at all  on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions 
if any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather in the future  or if extreme weather adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we are not ultimately successful in dismissing the action filed against treasure chest casino  we may potentially lose our ability to operate the treasure chest casino property and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino treasure chest  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
the hearing has not yet been rescheduled 
mr 
copeland has since passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
on june   the plaintiff filed to have the exceptions set for hearing 
the parties decided to submit the exceptions to the court on the previously filed briefs 
the court issued a ruling denying the exceptions on august  copeland s counsel indicated a desire to move forward with the litigation and requested that the parties respond to outstanding discovery 
subsequently  on august   robert j 
guidry  the co defendant  filed a third party demand against the us attorney s office seeking enforcement of guidry s plea agreement which would limit guidry s exposure in the case 
on september   the us attorney s office removed the suit to the us district court  middle district of louisiana 
pending before the district court are a motion to dismiss for failing to state a cause of action filed by guidry  asserting the same arguments he tried in state court  which the company joined  and a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed by the us attorney  which may result in the case being remanded to state court 
the us district court heard the motions on march  a ruling has not yet been issued 
on april   the us attorney s office moved for summary judgment  maintaining its jurisdictional argument as well as seeking substantive relief 
on september   the judge issued an order stating that the case should be remanded to state district court but allowed for additional filings by september  a remand order was issued on september   sending the case back to the th judicial district court  east baton rouge parish  state of louisiana 
guidry filed a motion for partial summary judgment on november  to limit the damages in the case 
treasure chest also filed a motion for protective order on november  the hearing on the pending motions is scheduled for march  we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer 
in addition  our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future 
although we have all risk property insurance coverage for our operating properties  which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire  natural disasters  acts of war  or terrorism  each policy has certain exclusions 
in addition  our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss 
our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 
in addition  certain casualty events  such as labor strikes  nuclear events  acts of war  loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism  deterioration or corrosion  insect or animal damage and pollution  may not be covered at all under our policies 
therefore  certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses 
we also have builder s risk insurance coverage for our development and expansion projects  including echelon 
builder s risk insurance provides coverage for projects during their construction for damage caused by a casualty loss 
in general  our builder s 
table of contents risk coverage is subject to the same exclusions  risks and deficiencies as those described above for our all risk property coverage 
our level of builder s risk insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 
blue chip  par a dice  sam s town tunica  sam s town shreveport  treasure chest and borgata are each located in an area that has been identified by the director of the fema as a special flood hazard area 
according to the fema statistics  a special flood hazard area has a chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation a year flood in any given year 
over a year period  the risk of a year flood in a special flood hazard area is 
our level of flood insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major flood 
due to flooding of the mississippi river  sam s town hotel and gambling hall was closed from may  until may  sam s town hotel and gambling hall was damaged  and while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance  we have not settled on our claims  and this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 
we renew our insurance policies other than our builder s risk insurance on an annual basis 
the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage 
our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage 
failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements 
we draw a significant percentage of our customers from certain geographic regions 
events adversely impacting the economy or these regions  including public health outbreaks and man made or natural disasters  may adversely impact our business 
the california  fremont and main street station draw a substantial portion of their customers from the hawaiian market 
for the year ended december   patrons from hawaii comprised of the room nights sold at the california  at fremont and at main street station 
decreases in discretionary consumer spending  as well as an increase in fuel costs or transportation prices  a decrease in airplane seat availability  or a deterioration of relations with tour and travel agents  particularly as they affect travel between the hawaiian market and our facilities  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our las vegas properties also draw a substantial number of customers from certain other specific geographic areas  including the southern california  arizona and las vegas local markets 
native american casinos in california and other parts of the united states have diverted some potential visitors away from nevada  which has had and could continue to have a negative effect on nevada gaming markets 
in addition  due to our significant concentration of properties in nevada  any man made or natural disasters in or around nevada  or the areas from which we draw customers to our las vegas properties  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
each of our properties located outside of nevada depends primarily on visitors from their respective surrounding regions and are subject to comparable risk 
additionally  the expansion of casino gaming in or near the mid atlantic region from which borgata attracts and expects to attract most of its customers could have a significant adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in  pennsylvania passed legislation allowing table games at certain casinos in the state  and other states near new jersey  including new york  delaware  connecticut  and maryland have or are currently contemplating gaming legislation 
the expansion of gaming facilities in nearby states will further increase competition and may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
borgata also competes with native american tribes in the northeast and mid atlantic region 
expansion of native american gaming could have an adverse effect on borgata s business  results of operations and financial condition  as native american gaming facilities typically have a significant operating advantage over borgata due to lower gaming taxes  allowing those facilities to market more aggressively and to expand or update their facilities at an accelerated rate 
the strength and profitability of our business depends on consumer demand for hotel casino resorts in general and for the type of amenities our properties offer 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could harm our business 
the terrorist attacks of september   other terrorist activities in the united states and elsewhere  military conflicts in iraq  afghanistan and in the middle east  outbreaks of infectious disease and pandemics  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  among other things  have had negative impacts on travel and leisure expenditures 
in addition  other factors affecting travel and discretionary consumer spending  including general economic conditions  disposable consumer income  fears of further economic decline and reduced consumer confidence in the economy  may negatively impact our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which similar events and conditions may continue to affect us in the future 
an extended period of reduced discretionary spending and or disruptions or declines in tourism could significantly harm our operations 
furthermore  our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time  as a 
table of contents result of casualty  flooding  forces of nature  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failure  or extended or extraordinary maintenance  among other causes 
if there is a prolonged disruption at any of our properties due to natural disasters  terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the outbreak of public health threats at any of our properties or in the areas in which they are located  or the perception that such threats exist  including pandemic health threats  such as the avian influenza virus  sars  or the hn flu  among others  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
likewise  adverse economic conditions that affect the national or regional economies in which we operate  whether resulting from war  terrorist activities or other geopolitical conflict  weather  general or localized economic downturns or related events or other factors  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that the airline industry is negatively impacted due to the effects of the economic recession and continued economic downturn  outbreak of war  public health threats  terrorist or similar activity  increased security restrictions or the public s general reluctance to travel by air  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
energy price increases may adversely affect our cost of operations and our revenues 
our casino properties use significant amounts of electricity  natural gas and other forms of energy 
in addition  our hawaiian air charter operation uses a significant amount of jet fuel 
while no shortages of energy or fuel have been experienced to date  substantial increases in energy and fuel prices  including jet fuel prices  in the united states have  and may continue to  negatively affect our results of operations 
the extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases  of which the impact could be material 
in addition  energy and gasoline price increases could result in a decline of disposable income of potential customers  an increase in the cost of travel and a corresponding decrease in visitation and spending at our properties  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
borgata has an executory contract with a wholly owned subsidiary of a local utility company with terms that extend to june  years from the opening of the water club 
the utility company provides borgata with electricity and thermal energy hot water and chilled water 
obligations under the thermal energy executory contract contain both fixed fees and variable fees based upon usage rates 
the fixed fee components under the thermal energy executory contract were estimated at approximately million per annum at december  borgata is also obligated to purchase a certain portion of its electricity demand at essentially a fixed rate which is estimated at approximately million per annum 
electricity demand in excess of the commitment is subject to market rates based on borgata s tariff class 
our facilities  including our riverboats and dockside facilities  are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure and regulatory compliance 
generally  all of our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time  as the result of casualty  forces of nature  mechanical failure  or extended or extraordinary maintenance  among other causes 
in addition  our gaming operations  including those conducted on riverboats or at dockside facilities could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions 
we currently conduct our treasure chest  par a dice  blue chip and sam s town shreveport gaming operations on riverboats 
each of our riverboats must comply with united states coast guard uscg requirements as to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety 
each riverboat must hold a certificate of inspection for stabilization and flotation  and may also be subject to local zoning codes 
the uscg requirements establish design standards  set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all personnel involved with the operation of the vessels 
loss of a vessel s certificate of inspection would preclude its use as a casino 
uscg regulations require a hull inspection for all riverboats at five year intervals 
under certain circumstances  alternative hull inspections may be approved 
the uscg may require that such hull inspections be conducted at a dry docking facility  and if so required  the cost of travel to and from such docking facility  as well as the time required for inspections of the affected riverboats  could be significant 
to date  the uscg has allowed in place underwater inspections of our riverboats twice every five years on alternate two and three year schedules 
the uscg may not continue to allow these types of inspections in the future 
the loss of a dockside casino or riverboat casino from service for any period of time could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
indiana and louisiana have adopted alternate inspection standards for riverboats in those states 
the standards require inspection by the american bureau shipping consulting absc 
absc inspection for our riverboats at blue chip  treasure chest and sam s town shreveport commenced during the par a dice riverboat will remain inspected by the uscg for the foreseeable future 
absc imposes essentially the same design  personnel  safety  and hull inspection standards as the uscg 
therefore  the risks to our business associated with uscg inspection should not change by reason of inspection by absc 
failure of a vessel 
table of contents to meet the applicable uscg or absc standards would preclude its use as a casino 
uscg regulations also require us to prepare and follow certain security programs 
in  we implemented the american gaming association s alternative security program at our riverboat casinos and dockside facilities 
the american gaming association s alternative security program is specifically designed to address maritime security requirements at riverboat casinos and their respective dockside facilities 
only portions of those regulations will apply to our riverboats inspected by absc 
changes to these regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our hotels and casinos are located on leased property 
if we default on one or more leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected hotel and or casino 
we lease certain parcels of land on which the orleans  suncoast  treasure chest  sam s town shreveport  ip and borgata s hotel and gaming facility are located 
in addition  we lease other parcels of land on which portions of the california and the fremont are located 
as a ground lessee  we have the right to use the leased land  however  we do not retain fee ownership in the underlying land 
accordingly  with respect to the leased land  we will have no interest in the land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases 
moreover  since we do not completely control the land underlying the property  a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the long term leases 
while such interruption is unlikely  such events are beyond our control 
if the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time  then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected 
if we were to default on any one or more of these leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land  including the hotels and casinos 
this would have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities 
risks related to our indebtedness we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
we had total consolidated long term debt  net of current maturities  of approximately billion at december  if we pursue  or continue to pursue  any expansion  development  investment or renovation projects  we expect that our long term debt will substantially increase in connection with related capital expenditures 
this indebtedness could have important consequences  including difficulty in satisfying our obligations under our current indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limiting  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our debt instruments contain  and any future debt instruments likely will contain  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  including providing guarantees or credit support  incur liens securing indebtedness or other obligations  dispose of assets  make certain acquisitions  pay dividends or make distributions and make other restricted payments  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in any new businesses  and enter into transactions with our stockholders and our affiliates

in addition  our amended credit facility requires us to maintain certain ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the amended credit facility of to  a total leverage ratio and a secured leverage ratio both as defined in the amended credit facility that adjust over the life of our amended credit facility 
we believe that we were in compliance with the amended credit facility covenants  including the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio and the maximum permitted secured leverage ratio  which  at december   were to  to and to  respectively 
at december   assuming our current level of consolidated funded indebtedness remains constant  we estimate that an or greater decline in our twelve month trailing consolidated ebitda  as compared to december   would cause us to exceed our maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio covenant for that period 
in addition  at december   assuming our current level of secured indebtedness remains constant  we estimate that or greater decline in our twelve month trailing consolidated ebitda  as compared to december   would cause us to exceed our maximum permitted secured leverage ratio covenant for that period 
additionally  at december   assuming our current level of interest expense remains constant  we estimate that a or greater decline in our twelve month trailing consolidated ebitda  as compared to december   would cause us to go below our minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant for that period 
however  in the event that we project our consolidated ebitda may decline by such levels or more  we could implement certain actions in an effort to minimize the possibility of a breach of the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio  the maximum permitted secured leverage ratio and the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenants 
these actions may include  among others  reducing payroll  benefits and certain other operating costs  deferring or eliminating certain maintenance  expansion or other capital expenditures  reducing our outstanding indebtedness through repurchases or redemption  and or increasing cash by selling assets or issuing equity 
boyd gaming senior subordinated and senior notes debt service requirements under our current outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior notes consist of semi annual interest payments based upon fixed annual interest rates ranging from to and repayment of our and senior 
table of contents subordinated notes due on april  and february   respectively  and repayment of our senior notes due on december borgata long term debt borgata has a bank credit facility 
the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility and matures in august the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by mddc and any future subsidiaries of mddc and is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of borgata s assets  subject to certain exceptions 
the obligations under the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  have priority in payment to borgata s senior secured notes 
borgata s bank credit facility  as amended  contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants that limit borgata s ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends and make other distributions  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate  and engage in unrelated business activities 
in addition  borgata has significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to pay dividends to us 
while we received a one time distribution from borgata of approximately million in august in connection with borgata s financing  any future distribution from borgata other than distributions to satisfy tax liabilities relating to income of borgata will be subject to the limitations on dividends  distributions and certain other restricted payments under borgata s bank credit agreement and the indenture governing borgata s senior secured notes 
we did not receive distributions from borgata during the year ended december  excluding the one time distribution from borgata discussed above  our distributions from borgata were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
other than the august distribution  the distributions from borgata have generally declined as a result of the decline in borgata s operating results 
borgata has significant uses for its cash flows  including maintenance capital expenditures  interest payments  state income taxes and the repayment of debt 
borgata s cash flows are primarily used for its business needs and are not generally available  to service our indebtedness  except to the extent distributions are paid to us  to satisfy tax liabilities related to income of borgata 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our amended credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 
we believe that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  at maturity  and cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our amended credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we may have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  certain states laws contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions 
some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital 
we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt  which could further exacerbate the risks described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the terms of the indentures governing our senior subordinated and senior notes and borgata s senior secured notes do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so 
approximately million of contractual availability was available for borrowing under our amended credit facility at december  if new debt is added to our  or our subsidiaries  current debt levels  the related risks that we or they now face could intensify 
borgata may be unable to refinance its indebtedness 
in august  borgata entered into a million bank credit facility that matures in august and issued million in 
table of contents senior secured debt  million of which matures in october and million of which matures in august on november   mdfc entered into the borgata bank credit facility amendment  which  among other things  modifies certain terms of the borgata bank credit facility 
the borgata bank credit facility amendment i reduces the aggregate commitments under the borgata bank credit facility to a maximum amount of million  ii decreases the minimum consolidated ebitda as defined in the borgata bank credit facility  as amended to million for a trailing twelve month period ending on the last day of a calendar quarter  iii eliminates the covenant requiring borgata to have a minimum amount of cash  cash equivalents  and unused commitments  and iv adds a covenant prohibiting borgata from borrowing under the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  to purchase its senior secured notes at any time when the total amount outstanding under the borgata bank credit facility is million or more 
borgata s ability to refinance its indebtedness will depend on its ability to generate future cash flow and borgata is entirely dependent on its operations  including the water club  for all of its cash flow 
its ability to generate cash in the future  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
it is unlikely that borgata s business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations in amounts sufficient to enable it to pay the principal on its indebtedness at maturity and to fund its other liquidity needs 
we believe borgata will need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness before maturity  and we cannot provide assurances that it will be able to repay or refinance its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
borgata may have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  new jersey laws and regulations contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions 
such restrictions may prevent borgata from obtaining necessary capital 
if we are unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as other capital expenditures  through cash flow  borrowings under the credit facility and additional financings  our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized 
we intend to finance our current and future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as our other capital expenditures  primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under the amended credit facility  and equity or debt financings 
if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  or our other capital expenditures  we will have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or abandoning planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  reducing the amount or suspending or discontinuing the distribution of dividends  obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners  or modifying the amended credit facility 
these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
recently  there have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital 
we anticipate that these disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will be able to fund any expansion projects using cash flows from operations and availability under the amended credit facility to the extent that availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
if availability under the amended credit facility does not exist or we are otherwise unable to make sufficient borrowings thereunder  any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
as a result  if we are unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for projects  limit the scope of  or defer such projects  or cancel the projects altogether 
in the event that capital markets do not improve and we are unable to access capital with more favorable terms  additional equity and or credit support may be necessary to obtain construction financing for the remaining cost of the project 
risks related to our equity ownership our common stock price may fluctuate substantially  and a shareholder s investment could decline in value 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  announcements of significant acquisitions or other agreements by us or by our competitors  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  trading volume of our common stock  conditions and trends in the gaming and destination entertainment industries  
table of contents changes in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets  and general economic conditions  including  without limitation  changes in the cost of fuel and air travel 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies operating performance 
broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  shareholder derivative lawsuits and or securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
certain of our stockholders own large interests in our capital stock and may significantly influence our affairs 
william s 
boyd  our executive chairman of the board of directors  together with his immediate family  beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding shares of common stock as of december  as such  the boyd family has the ability to significantly influence our affairs  including the election of members of our board of directors and  except as otherwise provided by law  approving or disapproving other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including a merger  consolidation  or sale of assets

item legal proceedings 
copeland alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino treasure chest  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and 
table of contents the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
the hearing has not yet been rescheduled 
mr 
copeland has since passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
on june   the plaintiff filed to have the exceptions set for hearing 
the parties decided to submit the exceptions to the court on the previously filed briefs 
the court issued a ruling denying the exceptions on august  copeland s counsel indicated a desire to move forward with the litigation and requested that the parties respond to outstanding discovery 
subsequently  on august   robert j 
guidry  the co defendant  filed a third party demand against the us attorney s office seeking enforcement of guidry s plea agreement which would limit guidry s exposure in the case 
on september   the us attorney s office removed the suit to the us district court  middle district of louisiana 
pending before the district court are a motion to dismiss for failing to state a cause of action filed by guidry  asserting the same arguments he tried in state court  which the company joined  and a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed by the us attorney  which may result in the case being remanded to state court 
the us district court heard the motions on march  a ruling has not yet been issued 
on april   the us attorney s office moved for summary judgment  maintaining its jurisdictional argument as well as seeking substantive relief 
on september   the judge issued an order stating that the case should be remanded to state district court but allowed for additional filings by september  a remand order was issued on september   sending the case back to the th judicial district court  east baton rouge parish  state of louisiana 
guidry filed a motion for partial summary judgment on november  to limit the damages in the case 
treasure chest also filed a motion for protective order on november  the hearing on the pending motions is scheduled for march  we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
nevada use tax refund claims on march   the nevada supreme court issued a decision in sparks nugget  inc vs 
the state of nevada department of taxation the department  holding that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals was exempt from use tax 
as a result of this decision  refund claims were filed for use tax paid  over the period november through may  on food purchased for subsequent use in complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 
we estimate the refund to be in the range of million to million  including interest 
in  the department audited and denied our refund claim while simultaneously issuing a million sales tax deficiency assessment  plus interest of million 
we appealed both the denial of the refund claim as well as the deficiency assessment in a hearing before the nevada administrative law judge judge in september in april  the judge issued a split decision  granting a refund on employee meals and applying a sales tax measure on complimentary meals  however  the ruling barred retroactive application of the sales tax measure to all years in the refund claim period  effectively overturning the department s deficiency assessment 
both we and the department appealed the decision to the nevada state tax commission the commission 
on august   the commission remanded the case back for a second administrative hearing  which was held on september   to allow for the introduction of additional supporting documentation 
the judge issued a decision on november   reversing her position on the employee meal refund claim while also affirming the denial of the complimentary meal refund  as well as the denial of a retroactive application of the sales tax measure to both employee and complimentary meals 
the judge s decision was affirmed in a commission hearing on january  on february  we filed a petition for judicial review in clark county district court 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of our appeal to district court  as well as subsequent appeals to higher levels of the state judicial system  we will not record any gain until both we and the department have exhausted all appeal options and a final  non appealable decision has been rendered 
for periods subsequent to may  we have not collected  remitted or accrued a liability for sales tax on complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties  as we do not believe it is probable  based on both procedural issues and the technical merits of the department s arguments  that we will owe this tax 
blue chip property taxes blue chip has previously received a valuation notice from the county assessor indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  in december  we received the property tax bill related to our tax assessment in the amount million  which we appealed  and  in february  we received a notice of revaluation  which reduced the initial tax assessment by approximately million 
since then  we have made the minimum required payment against the provisional bills related to the years from through  all of which were based on the valuation notice 
during the year ended december   we reached settlements with the county assessor  reducing the annual valuation for years through based on these settlements  we revised our cumulative property tax accrual to reflect the retrospective effect of the revised valuations 
the impact of these revisions to the valuations resulted in a reduction of our property tax accrual of approximately million  which was cumulatively reversed through property tax expense during the year ended december  although we have not received valuation notices for years and  or final tax rates for the years through  we believe the assessments for the period from january  through december  could result in a total property tax 
table of contents obligation ranging between million and million 
we have accrued  net of the payment of the minimum requirements discussed above  approximately million for this property tax liability as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely outcome within our range  once all valuations have been received and all tax rates have been finalized  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated amount accrued will approximate the actual amount billed 
the final tax assessment notices for the period january  through december   which have not been received as of december   could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip 
legal matters we are also parties to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that  except for the copeland matter discussed above  all pending claims  if adversely decided  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations

we began construction on echelon  our multibillion dollar las vegas strip development project  in the second quarter of echelon is located on the former stardust site  which we closed in november and demolished in march in august  due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at that time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market

as we do not believe that a significant level of economic recovery has occurred along the las vegas strip  or that financing for a development project like echelon is currently available on terms satisfactory to us  we do not expect to resume construction of echelon for three to five years 
we also do not believe that financing for a development project like echelon is currently available on terms satisfactory to us 
our emphasis we operate gaming entertainment properties  most of which also include hotel  dining  retail and other amenities 
our main business emphasis is on slot revenues  which are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties  which affects our operating results 
our properties have historically generated significant operating cash flow  with the majority of our revenue being cash based 
while we do provide casino credit  subject to certain gaming regulations and jurisdictions  most of our customers wager with cash and pay for non gaming services by cash or credit card 
our industry is capital intensive  we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow in order to fund maintenance capital expenditures  fund acquisitions  provide excess cash for future development  repay debt financing and 
table of contents associated interest costs  purchase our debt or equity securities  pay income taxes and pay dividends

overall outlook we believe that our key operating results for the year ended december  have begun to show positive trends 
although over the course of the past several years  the severe economic recession has had a profound effect on consumer confidence  and has shifted spending away from discretionary items  such as leisure  hospitality  gaming and entertainment activities  recent quarterly results indicate that we have realized some stabilizing trends in our business 
recently  and generally  the tourism industry has shown signs of recovery  as evidenced by increased visitation  hotel room rates and convention business 
economic influence due to a number of factors affecting consumers  including the increasing federal deficit  volatility in the stock market  the european debt crisis and high unemployment levels  all of which have resulted in reduced levels of consumer spending  the outlook for the gaming industry remains unpredictable 
we believe the severity and length of recovery from this economic recession has had a profound effect on consumer behavior and has led to a shift in spending from discretionary items 
because of these uncertain conditions  we have increasingly focused on managing our operating margins 
our present objective is to manage our cost and expense structure to address the current deterioration in business volumes  generating strong and stable cash flows and positioning the company to benefit from improved flow through of revenue growth 
positioning we continually work to position our company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through capital investment and other strategic initiatives 
for instance  in october  we purchased the ip casino resort spa the ip in biloxi  mississippi  which is a premier casino resort located on the mississippi gulf coast and includes  guest rooms and suites  a  square foot casino  a  seat theater offering regular headline entertainment  a spa and salon  and  square feet of meeting and convention space  as well as eight restaurants 
additionally  in january  we opened our story hotel at blue chip casino  hotel spa  which includes guest rooms  a spa and fitness center  additional meeting and event space  as well as new dining and nightlife venues 
boyd brand awareness we have also established a nationwide branding initiative and loyalty program 
previously  players were able to use their club coast or b connected cards to earn and redeem points at nearly all of our wholly owned boyd gaming properties in nevada  illinois  indiana  louisiana and mississippi 
in june  we launched an enhanced  multi property player loyalty program under the b connected brand  which replaced the club coast program 
customers under the club coast program were able to keep all earned benefits and club points they had previously earned under the program 
the new b connected club  among other 
table of contents benefits  extends the time period over which players may qualify for promotion and increases the credits awarded to reel slot and table games players 
in addition to the b connected player loyalty program  we launched the b connected mobile program in july b connected mobile  the first multi property  loyalty program based iphone application of its kind in the gaming industry  is a personalized mobile application that delivers customized offers and information directly to a customer s iphone  ipad 
or android device  making b connected mobile the first application of its kind available on multiple platforms

comp dollars  generally in the form of monetary discounts  and other rewards generally can only be redeemed at our restaurants  retail and spa facilities 
development activities echelon in august  due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at that time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market 
as we do not believe that a significant level of economic recovery has occurred along the las vegas strip  or that financing for a development project like echelon is currently available on terms satisfactory to us  we do not expect to resume construction of echelon for three to five years 
nonetheless  we remain committed to having a significant presence on the las vegas strip 
during the suspension period  we continue to consider alternative development options for echelon  which may include developing the project in phases  alternative capital structures for the project  scope modifications to the project  or additional strategic partnerships  among others 
we can provide no assurances as to when  or if  construction will resume on the project  or if we will be able to obtain alternative sources of financing for the project 
as we develop and explore the viability of alternatives for the project  we will monitor these assets for recoverability 
if we are subject to a non cash write down of these assets  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements

as a result  we have consolidated the financial position and results of operations of borgata from march  through december  period prior to such date were not restated or recasted as a result of this change and reflect the accounting for our interest in borgata under the equity method 
accordingly  the financial position of borgata is presented in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   its results of operations for the year ended december  are included in our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows for the year ended december   its results of operations for the period from march  through december  are included in our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  and for the full year ended december  results of operations summary years ended december   and we believe that our key operating results for the year ended december  showed increasing positive trends throughout the year 
although over the course of the past several years  the severe economic recession has had a profound effect on consumer confidence  and has shifted spending away from discretionary items  such as leisure  hospitality  gaming and entertainment activities  results during the year ended december  indicate that we have realized some stabilizing trends in our business 
generally  the job market is strengthening  as the national unemployment rate has continued to decline throughout as the job market recovers and expands  we believe that consumer confidence will strengthen further 
these and other positive trends reflect recoveries in our wholly owned businesses 
specifically  in our las vegas locals region  visitor counts  room rates and convention sales began to stabilize and increase over the past eighteen months 
our downtown las vegas segment is benefiting from successful marketing efforts to our hawaiian customers  and the strength of the local hawaiian economy 
the economy in the midwest and south region has been more resilient than the national and las vegas economies  as certain of our properties reported margin improvements and record growth during the year ended december  although we have gained record market share and increased non gaming revenues in atlantic city  the entire market continues to experience a difficult period  due to increased local and regional competition 
throughout the discussion in this section  certain line items in our results of operations for the years ended december  and are presented both on an actual and a pro forma basis  giving effect of the consolidation of borgata as if such had occurred on january  or  respectively  rather than march  these presentations are for the purposes of comparability  and all such results and discussions reflecting these pro forma adjustments are identified as such 
overview of key operating results years ended december   and 
table of contents years ended december  actual pro forma actual pro forma in thousands net revenues operating income net income loss attributable to boyd gaming corporation years ended december  and net revenues net revenues were billion for the year ended december  as compared to a pro forma billion for the comparable period in the prior year  an increase of approximately million or 
the ip acquisition which occurred on october   remunerated million in net revenues during the period from october  through december  while certain properties and regions showed growth in the latter half of the year ended december   our business continued to stabilize throughout the year but net revenues were partially offset by increased promotional activities 
promotional allowances increased by million primarily due to the acquisition of ip  which represented million of this increase  as well as borgata s promotional allowances which increased by million in response to increased competition 
the increase in ip and borgata promotional allowances was offset by our cost containment measures at other properties 
as discussed below  we saw stabilizing and improving trends throughout the year ended december   which were offset by a decline in our other segments  the most significant decrease of which was in atlantic city 
operating income operating income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   on a pro forma basis  representing an increase of million or 
this increase was due to improved operating efficiencies  which given our focus on cost containment over the past several years  largely improves our profit margins  which increased overall by basis points 
the increase was also somewhat attributable to the operating performance of ip since its acquisition  which contributed approximately million in operating income during the year ended december  the increase was offset by an incremental million in other operating charges  net  which represented charges of million  and included million of asset impairment charges  million of acquisition costs related primarily to the acquisition of ip and the evaluation of other acquisition opportunities and million related to the insurance deductible and other non reimbursable costs related to the flooding at sam s town tunica during the year ended december  net loss attributable to boyd gaming corporation net loss attributable to boyd gaming corporation was million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the corresponding period of the prior year  due primarily to significantly higher interest costs

years ended december  and net revenues pro forma net revenues were billion for the year ended december  as compared to pro forma net revenues of billion for the comparable period in the prior year  a decrease of approximately million or 
the decline was primarily due to lower levels of consumer spending  room rate pressures experienced in our las vegas locals region and lower visitor volumes in our downtown region 
in addition  net revenues at our louisiana properties stabilized in the latter half of but continued to decline throughout the year as market conditions normalized in that region from the strong and  in some cases  record levels in the prior year 
borgata contributed million in net revenues  on a pro forma basis  which reflected a decline of million from the comparable prior year period primarily due to the impact of declines in table game hold  adverse impact of severe weather and reduced visitation to atlantic city during the year 
operating income on a comparable pro forma basis  operating income declined by to million during the year ended december  compared to the prior year  primarily due to the residual effect of the net revenue items identified above for the years ended december  and during the year ended december   operating income from borgata  reflected on a comparable pro forma basis in both periods  declined million  or  due to the lower net revenue base and insurance gain on workers compensation 
net income loss attributable to boyd gaming corporation net income attributable to boyd gaming corporation increased by million  or  due primarily to the recognition of 
table of contents the million payment associated with the amendment to our operating agreement with mgm earlier that year 
the overall increase in net income was offset by increased interest expense  due primarily to the refinancing of borgata s debt  and by a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments due to the de designation of such as hedged during the year ended december  operating revenues years ended december   and the following analysis discusses our operating revenues  on a consolidated basis  which are further supplemented by our operating segment detail below 
we derive the majority of our gross revenues from our gaming operations  which generated approximately  and of gross revenues for the years ended december   and respectively 
food and beverage gross revenues  which generated approximately of gross revenues for each of the years ended december  and and during the year ended december   represent the next most significant revenue source  followed by room and other  both of which separately contributed less than of gross revenues during all of these respective years 
year ended december  actual pro forma actual pro forma in thousands revenues gaming food and beverage room other gross revenues less promotional allowances net revenues costs and expenses gaming food and beverage room other margins gaming food and beverage room other years ended december and gaming gaming revenues are significantly comprised of the net win from our slot machine operations and to a lesser extent from table games win 
gaming revenues increased by million  or  during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding pro forma amount from the prior year due primarily to increases in slot handle and slot win of and  respectively  which resulted in a increase in slot win percentage 
additionally  table drop and table game win increased and  respectively  which yielded a corresponding increase in the table game win percentage 
ip accounted for a million increase in gaming revenues  rendering a flat performance year over year across various properties 
gaming related costs remained flat  on a pro forma basis  based on our focus on cost containment measures  resulting in a slight increase of basis points in gross gaming margins 
food and beverage 
table of contents food and beverage revenues increased by million  or during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding pro forma amount from the prior year period due to a increase in the average guest check  which more than offset the decrease in food covers 
ip contributed million of food and beverage revenue  and its average guest check and food covers are included herein 
the increase in food and beverage costs of million is due to a increase in cost per cover 
room room revenues increased by million  or  of which ip contributed million during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding pro forma amount from the prior year period  primarily due to an increase in the average daily rate adr of and increase in occupancy of driven by destination and convention business 
the increase in room costs and expenses of million  or is due to the increased occupancy coupled with a increase in cost per room which resulted in a reduction in margin of basis points 
other other revenues increased by million  or during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding pro forma amount from the prior year period  primarily due to increased hotel occupancy and differing amenities offered at our properties  including entertainment and nightclub revenues  retail sales  theater tickets and other venues 
related other expenses increased by as compared to the prior year pro forma amounts due to lower overall margins on the respective composition of increased sales 
years ended december and gaming gaming revenues are significantly comprised of the net win from our slot machine operations and to a lesser extent from table games win 
on a comparable pro forma basis  gaming revenue decreased million  or during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to decreases in slot handle of  partially offset by a increase in slot drop  resulting in a net decrease in slot win of 
additionally  table games drop and win decreased by a respective and  which resulted in a corresponding decrease in the table game win percentage 
we believe the decrease in gaming volumes reflected the ongoing constraints in consumer spending which resulted from the weakened economy 
gaming related costs decreased million as a result of the factors mentioned above 
food and beverage on a comparable pro forma basis  food and beverage revenues increased by million  or during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding pro forma amount from the prior year period due to a slight increase in banquet sales and a shift in consumer spending patterns 
there was a increase in the average guest check 
room on a comparable pro forma basis  room revenues remained relatively flat and decreased million during the year ended december  other on a comparable pro forma basis  other revenues decreased million  or and other expenses decreased million  or during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a reduction in the number of shows held at our entertainment venues 
revenues and adjusted ebitda by reportable segment we determine each of our properties profitability based upon adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  deferred rent  preopening expenses  share based compensation expense  and other operating charges  as applicable 
reportable segment adjusted ebitda is the aggregate sum of the adjusted ebitda for each of the properties comprising our las vegas locals  downtown las vegas  midwest and south and atlantic city segments and also includes our share of borgata s operating income  during the period in which it was accounted for under the equity method of accounting in  before net amortization  preopening and other items

although local competition has created an elevated promotional environment  however  through strategic marketing  the region has increased margins by basis points for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the segment also generated growth in hotel occupancy and average daily rates due to increased convention business in the las vegas market generally 
downtown las vegas net revenues and adjusted ebitda increased by and respectively  during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year  due primarily to growth in all primary operating revenues gaming  food and beverage and room  generated largely from our hawaiian customers 
greater efficiencies in our operations contributed to strong flow through in our results  which were partially offset by significantly higher fuel costs at our hawaiian charter operation 
jet fuel prices have risen sharply during the year  and while our ability to increase fares is limited by fierce competition  we recently introduced a new aircraft on the charter service that will increase capacity and improve costs 
midwest and south net revenues and adjusted ebitda increased by and  respectively  during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the increase in net revenues was entirely from the acquisition of ip  which renumerated million to our revenues for the fourth quarter of while million of the million increase in adjusted ebitda is related to the acquisition of ip  the remaining increase to adjusted ebitda is from our business continuing to grow across this region  due to geographic resiliency  most particularly resulting from economic strength in southern louisiana 
margin improvements of basis points excluding the effect of ip  have resulted from tight cost control  including disciplined marketing spend 
atlantic city net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the pro forma results for the year ended december   decreased by to million from million  and adjusted ebitda declined by to million from million 
overall  results during the year were negatively impacted by the closure of the property during hurricane irene  which cost the property three days of business volume during a relatively busy summer month 
additionally  throughout the year  borgata 
table of contents has been adversely impacted by promotional spend  which increased to of gross gaming revenue for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
this spend represented increased promotional incentives in response to the increasingly competitive environment in the atlantic city and eastern pennsylvania gaming markets 
years ended december  and las vegas locals net revenues and adjusted ebitda declined and  respectively  during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  due primarily to cautious discretionary spending by our unrated and lower tiered players 
both revenues and adjusted ebitda improved in each quarter of  signaling signs of recovery in this region  however  the promotional environment continues to be highly competitive 
downtown las vegas net revenues and adjusted ebitda declined and  respectively  during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due primarily to higher fuel costs and lower ticket prices on our hawaiian charter operation 
we retained market share but saw noticeable declines in the amount of spend per visit by our customers 
midwest and south net revenues and adjusted ebitda declined by and  respectively  during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due primarily to lower levels of consumer spending  however  our business continues to stabilize across this region 
we returned to growth in both gross revenues and adjusted ebitda during the latter half of atlantic city during the year ended  we recorded million of adjusted ebitda related to borgata  driven by million in net revenues 
net revenues decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year pro forma period 
the decrease in net revenues is due to a decline in table game win of and slot win of  which were due to an decrease in table games drop  a basis point decrease in the table games hold percentage and a decrease in slot handle 
these results have been negatively impacted by heightened competition in the atlantic city market 
we also believe the decrease in gaming volumes reflect the ongoing constraints in consumer spending resulting from the weakened economy

maintenance and utilities maintenance and utilities expenses  as a percentage of gross revenues  decreased from to  on a pro forma basis  during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year

dividends dividends are declared at the discretion of our board of directors 
we are subject to certain limitations regarding payment of dividends  such as restricted payment limitations related to our outstanding notes and our amended credit facility 
in july  our board of directors suspended the quarterly dividend for the current and future periods  therefore  we did not declare a dividend during the years ended december   and share repurchase program subject to applicable corporate securities laws  repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate 
we are subject to certain limitations regarding the repurchase of common stock  such as restricted payment limitations related to our outstanding notes and our amended credit facility

we have in the past  and may in the future  acquire our debt or equity securities  through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  tender offers  exchange offers  redemptions or otherwise  upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine 
other items affecting liquidity there have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital  with such disruptions expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
despite these disruptions  we anticipate the ability to fund our capital requirements using cash flows from operations and availability under our amended credit facility  to the extent availability exists after we meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months 
any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
the outcome of the following specific matters  including our commitments and contingencies  may also affect our liquidity 

table of contents acquisition of ip casino resort spa on october   we completed our previously announced acquisition of the assets of the ip  for a purchase price of million in cash  net of certain retrospective working capital adjustments 
following the closing of the transaction  we also made a charitable contribution to the engelstad family foundation equal to an aggregate of million  which is included in the net purchase price  and which funds are intended to be distributed on behalf of  and in the name of  boyd gaming  over five years to charitable organizations to be designated by boyd gaming 
in addition  following the closing  we intend to perform certain capital improvement projects with respect to the ip with costs estimated to be million 
commitments capital spending and development we continually perform on going refurbishment and maintenance at our facilities to maintain our standards of quality 
certain of these maintenance costs are capitalized  if such improvement or refurbishment extends the life of the related asset  while other maintenance costs that do not so qualify are expensed as incurred 
although we do not have any present future expansion projects  if any opportunities arise  such projects will require significant capital commitments 
the commitment of capital and the related timing thereof are contingent upon  among other things  negotiation of final agreements and receipt of approvals from the appropriate regulatory bodies 
we must also comply with covenants and restrictions set forth in our debt agreements 
our estimated total capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million and are primarily comprised of million of certain capital improvement projects with respect to the consummation of ip and various maintenance capital projects 
we intend to fund such capital expenditures through our amended credit facility and operating cash flows 
echelon in august  due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at that time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market 
as we do not believe that a significant level of economic recovery has occurred along the las vegas strip  or that financing for a development project like echelon is currently available on terms satisfactory to us  we do not expect to resume construction of echelon for three to five years 
nonetheless  we remain committed to having a significant presence on the las vegas strip 
during the suspension period  we continue to consider alternative development options for echelon  which may include developing the project in phases  alternative capital structures  scope modifications  or additional strategic partnerships  among others 
we can provide no assurances as to when  or if  construction will resume on echelon  or if we will be able to obtain alternative sources of financing for the project 
we evaluate our investment in assets held for development in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance on impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for a long lived asset to be held and used  such as these assets under development  we review the asset for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
the asset is not impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  then an impairment charge is recorded  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model  which is based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year free cash flow multiples 
for these assets under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
the further delay of the suspension of development on the echelon project implied that the carrying amounts of the assets related to the development may not be recoverable  therefore  at the time  we performed an impairment test of these assets 
these impairment tests were comprised of an appraisal of the development and an analysis of its future undiscounted cash flow  and contemplated several viable alternative plans for the future development of echelon 
the cash inflows related to the revenue projections for the individual components associated with each planned construction scenario  offset by outflows for estimated costs to complete the development and ongoing maintenance and operating costs 
because no specific strategic plan can be determined with certainty at this time  the analysis considered the net cash flows related to each alternative  weighted against its projected likelihood 
we initially performed this evaluation during the year ended december   when the continued suspension was announced  and have reconsidered our assumptions on a regular basis since such date 
however  due to the degradation in economic conditions in the intervening period since  we re performed these analyses during the year ended december  to evaluate any further depression in real estate or land values as well as any deterioration in our initial cash flow assumptions 
the outcome of this evaluation did not result in an impairment of echelon s assets  as the estimated weighted net undiscounted cash flows from the project exceed the current carrying value of the assets of approximately billion at both december  and as we further develop and explore the viability of alternatives for the project  we will continue to monitor these assets for recoverability 

table of contents as part of our delay of the project  the capitalized costs related to the echelon project included land and construction in progress 
the construction and development costs consist primarily of site preparation work  underground utility installation and infrastructure and common area development 
professional and design fees include architectural design  development and permitting fees  inspections  consulting and legal fees 
we expect to incur a one time capitalized cost of million  principally related to site beautification and preservation in additionally we expect to incur approximately million to million of capitalized costs annually  principally related to such items as site preparation work  underground utility installation  infrastructure and consulting 
in addition  we expect recurring project costs  consisting primarily of monthly charges related to construction of the central energy center  site security  property taxes  rent and insurance  of approximately million to million per annum that will be charged to preopening or other expense as incurred during the project s suspension period 
the following information summarizes the contingencies with respect to our various material commitments  which are in addition to capitalized costs and annual recurring project costs  related to echelon energy sales agreement lve energy partners  llc lve is a joint venture between marina energy llc and dco ech energy  llc 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  echelon resorts llc echelon resorts  we have entered into an energy sales agreement esa with lve  to design  build  own other than the underlying real property which is leased from echelon resorts and operate a central energy center and related distribution system for our planned echelon resort development 
pursuant to the esa  lve will provide chilled and hot water  electricity and emergency electricity generation to echelon and potentially other joint venture entities associated with the echelon development project or other third parties 
however  since we are obligated to purchase substantially all of the output of the central energy center  we are the primary beneficiary under the terms of the esa 
lve has suspended construction of the central energy center while the echelon project is delayed 
on april   lve notified us that  in its view  echelon resorts would be in breach of the esa unless it recommenced and proceeded with construction of the echelon development project by may  we believe that lve s position is without merit  however  in the event of litigation  we cannot state with certainty the eventual outcome nor estimate the possible loss or range of loss  if any  associated with this matter 
on march   echelon resorts and lve entered into both a purchase option agreement the purchase option agreement and a periodic fee agreement the periodic fee agreement 
under the periodic fee agreement  echelon resorts and lve have mutually agreed that neither lve nor echelon resorts would give notice of  file or otherwise initiate any claim or cause of action  in or before any court  administrative agency  arbitrator  mediator or other tribunal  that arises under the esa  subject to certain exceptions  and any statute of limitations or limitation periods for defenses  claims  causes of actions and counterclaims shall be tolled while the periodic fee agreement is in effect 
the prohibition on the initiation of litigation and the tolling of the statute of limitations provided for in the periodic fee agreement should be applicable to any litigation with respect to lve s april  claim of an alleged breach of the esa 
under the periodic fee agreement  echelon resorts agreed to pay lve  beginning on march   a monthly periodic fee and an operation and maintenance fee until either i echelon resorts notifies lve that it has resumed construction of a portion of the echelon development project that it owns in fee simple and echelon resorts and lve have mutually agreed to changes to the dates in their respective construction milestones under the esa  or ii echelon resorts exercises its option to purchase lve s assets pursuant to the terms of the purchase option agreement 
the amount of the periodic fee is fixed at million annually through november thereafter  the amount of the periodic fee is estimated to be approximately million annually 
the operation and maintenance fee cannot exceed million per annum without echelon s prior approval 
we have posted a letter of credit in the amount of million to secure echelon s resorts obligation to pay the periodic fee and the operation and maintenance fee 
under the purchase option agreement  echelon resorts has the right  at its sole discretion  upon written notice to lve  to purchase the assets of lve including the central energy center and related distribution system for a price of million  subject to certain possible adjustments 
both the esa and the periodic fee agreement would be terminated concurrent with the purchase of the lve assets pursuant to the purchase option agreement 
line extension and service agreement lea in march  we entered into an lea with nevada power company currently known as nv energy related to the construction of a substation at echelon and the delivery of power to echelon 
we have assigned most of our obligations under the lea to lve see energy sales agreement esa above 
we have retained an obligation to pay liquidated damages of million to nv energy  in the event that echelon does not physically accept permanent electric service by january  through the substation to be built by nv energy pursuant to the lea 
on august   nv energy issued a letter declaring a force majeure event 
table of contents that extends the time for performance of obligations under the lea  including its obligation to construct the substation from which echelon is to accept delivery of permanent electric service 
nv energy has not built the substation and we currently do not have an obligation to pay the liquidated damage amount of million because delivery of permanent electric service from the substation is not possible 
our contingent liability to pay liquidated damages to nv energy will be recorded and charged to expense on our consolidated statement of operations when  or if  it becomes probable that we will not be able to accept  in accordance with the terms of the lea  permanent electric service from a substation when built by nv energy 
construction agreements we have exercised our rights under our standard form construction contracts to terminate our agreements with our contractors 
all major construction agreements have been terminated and closed out with final payments made to the contractors in exchange for final releases  with the exception of certain custom skylight  curtain wall  and elevator orders  which we are in the process of closing out based upon final material deliveries and negotiations 
storage of our steel continues under long term offsite lease agreements 
clark county fees in november  we entered into an agreement with clark county for the development of the project 
the agreement requires payment of million  allocated among four annual installments  which commenced in january we have made the first of those payments 
in december  clark county granted us a one year deferral for each of the remaining fixed annual installments due under the development agreement 
clark county is in the process of reviewing our request for a further deferral of the remaining fixed annual payments for up to five years 
while they consider our request  no payments are due 
furthermore  we are also responsible for our share of the cost of new pedestrian bridges that may be constructed by clark county  of which our share is estimated to be million 
the bridges will not be required to be built until after construction echelon on recommences 
leed tax credits we are pursuing echelon s certification under the leadership in energy and environmental design leed silver standard or equivalent for the project as part of the state of nevada s tax incentive program the leed program 
the leed program allows for echelon to receive an exemption on the non state  local sales and use tax rate of on qualifying construction materials purchased prior to december  as we intend to resume construction of echelon and qualify for the leed silver standard or equivalent certification  we will not record a liability for the abated local portion of sales and use tax on the qualifying construction materials  however  if echelon does not open or if it fails to qualify for the leed silver standard certification or equivalent after its completion  we will accrue and pay the deferral amount of sales and use tax million at december   plus interest at the rate of per annum  which will be recorded as construction in progress on our consolidated balance sheet 
we remain eligible for the leed program  notwithstanding our suspension of the echelon project 
other agreements certain other agreements  such as office leases and warehouse leases will be charged to preopening expense as incurred 
while we can provide no assurances  we do not believe that any of our other agreements for the project give rise to any material liabilities resulting from the delay of the project 
we believe that continuing committed costs under the lease agreements  on an aggregate basis  will be approximately million annually

copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino treasure chest  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district 
table of contents court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
the hearing has not yet been rescheduled 
mr 
copeland has since passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
on june   the plaintiff filed to have the exceptions set for hearing 
the parties decided to submit the exceptions to the court on the previously filed briefs 
the court issued a ruling denying the exceptions on august  copeland s counsel indicated a desire to move forward with the litigation and requested that the parties respond to outstanding discovery 
subsequently  on august   robert j 
guidry  the co defendant  filed a third party demand against the us attorney s office seeking enforcement of guidry s plea agreement which would limit guidry s exposure in the case 
on september   the us attorney s office removed the suit to the us district court  middle district of louisiana 
pending before the district court are a motion to dismiss for failing to state a cause of action filed by guidry  asserting the same arguments he tried in state court  which the company joined  and a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed by the us attorney  which may result in the case being remanded to state court 
the us district court heard the motions on march  a ruling has not yet been issued 
on april   the us attorney s office moved for summary judgment  maintaining its jurisdictional argument as well as seeking substantive relief 
on september   the judge issued an order stating that the case should be remanded to state district court but allowed for additional filings by september  a remand order was issued on september   sending the case back to the th judicial district court  east baton rouge parish  state of louisiana 
guidry filed a motion for partial summary judgment on november  to limit the damages in the case 
treasure chest also filed a motion for protective order on november  the hearing on the pending motions is scheduled for march  we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
nevada use tax refund claims on march   the nevada supreme court issued a decision in sparks nugget  inc vs 
the state of nevada department of taxation the department  holding that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals was exempt from use tax 
as a result of this decision  refund claims were filed for use tax paid  over the period november through may  on food purchased for subsequent use in complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 
we estimate the refund to be in the range of million to million  including interest 
in  the department audited and denied our refund claim while simultaneously issuing a million sales tax deficiency assessment  plus interest of million 
we appealed both the denial of the refund claim as well as the deficiency assessment in a hearing before the nevada administrative law judge judge in september in april  the judge issued a split decision  granting a refund on employee meals and applying a sales tax measure on complimentary meals  however  the ruling barred retroactive application of the sales tax measure to all years in the refund claim period  effectively overturning the department s deficiency assessment 
both we and the department appealed the decision to the nevada state tax commission the commission 
on august   the commission remanded the case back for a second administrative hearing  which was held on september   to allow for the introduction of additional supporting documentation 
the judge issued a decision on november   reversing her position on the employee meal refund claim while also affirming the denial of the complimentary meal refund  as well as the denial of a retroactive application of the sales tax measure to both employee and complimentary meals 
the judge s decision was affirmed in a commission hearing on january  on february  we filed a petition for judicial review in clark county district court 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of our appeal to district court  as well as subsequent appeals to higher levels of the state judicial system  we will not record any gain until both we and the department have exhausted all appeal options and a final  non appealable decision has been rendered 
for periods subsequent to may  we have not collected  remitted or accrued a liability for sales tax on complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties  as we do not believe it is probable  based on both procedural issues and the technical merits of the department s arguments  that we will owe this tax 
blue chip property taxes blue chip has previously received a valuation notice from the county assessor indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  in december  we received the property tax bill related to our tax 
table of contents assessment in the amount million  which we appealed  and  in february  we received a notice of revaluation  which reduced the initial tax assessment by approximately million 
since then  we have made the minimum required payment against the provisional bills related to the years from through  all of which were based on the valuation notice 
during the year ended december   we reached settlements with the county assessor  reducing the annual valuation for years through based on these settlements  we revised our cumulative property tax accrual to reflect the retrospective effect of the revised valuations 
the impact of these revisions to the valuations resulted in a reduction of our property tax accrual of approximately million  which was cumulatively reversed through property tax expense during the year ended december  although we have not received valuation notices for years and  or final tax rates for the years through  we believe the assessments for the period from january  through december  could result in a total property tax obligation ranging between million and million 
we have accrued  net of the payment of the minimum requirements discussed above  approximately million for this property tax liability as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely outcome within our range  once all valuations have been received and all tax rates have been finalized  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated amount accrued will approximate the actual amount billed 
the final tax assessment notices for the period january  through december   which have not been received as of december   could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip

we also pursue expansion opportunities in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
such expansions will be affected and determined by several key factors  which may include the following 
table of contents the outcome of gaming license selection processes  the approval of gaming in jurisdictions where we have been active but where casino gaming is not currently permitted  identification of additional suitable investment opportunities in current gaming jurisdictions  and availability of acceptable financing 
additional projects may require us to make substantial investments or may cause us to incur substantial costs related to the investigation and pursuit of such opportunities  which investments and costs we may fund through cash flow from operations or availability under our amended credit facility 
to the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient  we may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
moreover  we can provide no assurances that any expansion opportunity will result in a completed transaction 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements mainly consist of the following agreements to provide electricity  emergency electricity generation  and chilled and hot water to echelon and borgata 
energy sales agreement as discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation  in april  we entered into an energy sales agreement the esa with lve 
lve is a joint venture between marina energy llc and dco ech energy  llc  to design  build  own other than the underlying real property which is leased from echelon resorts and operate a central energy center and related distribution system for our planned echelon resort development 
pursuant to the esa  lve will provide chilled and hot water  electricity and emergency electricity generation to echelon and potentially other joint venture entities associated with the echelon development project or other third parties 
however  since we are obligated to purchase substantially all of the output of the central energy center  we are the primary beneficiary under the terms of the esa 
lve has suspended construction of the central energy center while the echelon project is delayed 
on april   lve notified us that  in its view  echelon resorts would be in breach of the esa unless it recommenced and proceeded with construction of the echelon development project by may  we believe that lve s position is without merit  however  in the event of litigation  we cannot state with certainty the eventual outcome nor estimate the possible loss or range of loss  if any  associated with this matter 
on march   echelon resorts and lve entered into both a purchase option agreement the purchase option agreement and a periodic fee agreement the periodic fee agreement 
under the periodic fee agreement  echelon resorts and lve have mutually agreed that neither lve nor echelon resorts would give notice of  file or otherwise initiate any claim or cause of action  in or before any court  administrative agency  arbitrator  mediator or other tribunal  that arises under the esa  subject to certain exceptions  and any statute of limitations or limitation periods for defenses  claims  causes of actions and counterclaims shall be tolled while the periodic fee agreement is in effect 
the prohibition on the initiation of litigation and the tolling of the statute of limitations provided for in the periodic fee agreement should be applicable to any litigation with respect to lve s april  claim of an alleged breach of the esa 
under the periodic fee agreement  echelon resorts agreed to pay lve  beginning on march   a monthly periodic fee and an operation and maintenance fee until either i echelon resorts notifies lve that it has resumed construction of a portion of the echelon development project that it owns in fee simple and echelon resorts and lve have mutually agreed to changes to the dates in their respective construction milestones under the esa  or ii echelon resorts exercises its option to purchase lve s assets pursuant to the terms of the purchase option agreement 
the amount of the periodic fee is fixed at million annually through november thereafter  the amount of the periodic fee is estimated to be approximately million annually 
the operation and maintenance fee cannot exceed million per annum without echelon s prior approval 
we have posted a letter of credit in the amount of million to secure echelon s resorts obligation to pay the periodic fee and the operation and maintenance fee 
under the purchase option agreement  echelon resorts has the right  at its sole discretion  upon written notice to lve  to purchase the assets of lve including the central energy center and related distribution system for a price of million  subject to certain possible adjustments 
both the esa and the periodic fee agreement would be terminated concurrent with the purchase of the lve assets pursuant to the purchase option agreement 
utility contract in  borgata amended its executory contracts with a wholly owned subsidiary of a local utility company  extending the end of the term to years from the opening of the water club 
the utility company provides borgata with electricity and thermal energy hot water and chilled water 
obligations under the thermal energy executory contract contain both fixed fees and variable 
table of contents fees based upon usage rates 
the fixed fee components under the thermal energy executory contract are currently estimated at approximately million per annum 
borgata also committed to purchase a certain portion of its electricity demand at essentially a fixed rate  which is estimated at approximately million per annum 
electricity demand in excess of the commitment is subject to market rates based on borgata s tariff class 
indemnification we have entered into certain agreements that contain indemnification provisions  as well as indemnification agreements involving certain of our executive officers and directors 
these agreements provide indemnity insurance pursuant to which directors and officers are indemnified or insured against liability or loss under certain circumstances  which may include liability or related loss under the securities act and the exchange act 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that provide for indemnification of our directors  officers  employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by law 
outstanding letters of credit at december  and  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
other arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than interest rate swaps  interest rate collars and interest rate caps 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews and refines those estimates  the following of which materially impact our consolidated financial statements the recoverability of long lived assets  preservation of assets held for development  application of acquisition method accounting to our controlling interest in borgata  valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill  determination of self insured reserves  and provisions for deferred tax assets  certain tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions 
judgments are based on information including  but not limited to  historical experience  industry trends  conventional practices  expert opinions  terms of existing agreements and information from outside sources 
judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  and therefore actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment and complexity  the sensitivity of which could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if triggering events are identified  we then compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
the asset is not impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  then an impairment charge is recorded  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model  which is based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year free cash flow multiples 
we reconsider changes in circumstances on a frequent basis  and if a triggering event related to potential impairment has occurred  we solicit third party valuation expertise to assist in the valuation of our investment 
there are three generally accepted approaches available in developing an opinion of value the cost  sales comparison and income approaches 
we generally consider each of these approaches in developing a recommendation of the fair value of the asset  however the reliability of each approach is dependent upon the availability and comparability of the market data uncovered  as well as  the decision making criteria used by market participants when evaluating a property 
we will bifurcate our investment and apply the most indicative approach to overall fair valuation  or in some cases  a weighted analysis of any or all of these methods 
developing an opinion of land value is typically accomplished using a sales comparison approach by analyzing recent sales transactions of similar sites 
potential comparables are researched and the pertinent facts are confirmed with parties involved in the transaction 
this process fosters a general understanding of the potential comparable sales and facilitates the selection of the most relevant comparables by the appraiser 
valuation is typically accomplished using a unit of comparison such as price per square foot of land or potential building area 
adjustments are applied to the unit of comparison from an analysis of comparable 
table of contents sales  and the adjusted unit of comparison is then used to derive a value for the property 
the cost approach is based on the premise that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset of similar utility than its replacement or reproduction cost 
the cost to replace the asset would include the cost of constructing a similar asset of equivalent utility at prices applicable at the time of the valuation date 
to arrive at an estimate of the fair value using the cost approach  the replacement cost new is determined and reduced for depreciation of the asset 
replacement cost new is defined as the current cost of producing or constructing a similar new item having the nearest equivalent utility as the property being valued 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of the asset 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the subject asset 
the steps followed in applying this approach include estimating the expected before tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its life and converting these before tax cash flows to present value through capitalization or discounting 
the process uses a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and risk factors 
there are two common methods for converting net income into value  those methods are the direct capitalization and discounted cash flow methods dcf 
direct capitalization is a method used to convert an estimate of a single year s income expectancy into an indication of value in one direct step by dividing the income estimate by an appropriate capitalization rate 
under the dcf method  anticipated future cash flows and a reversionary value are discounted to an opinion of net present value at a specific internal rate of return or a yield rate  because net operating income of the subject property is not fully stabilized 
our long lived assets were carried at billion at december   or of our consolidated total assets 
a long lived asset shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances i 
a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  ii 
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  iii 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iv 
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  v 
a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  and or vi 
a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we did not identify any events or circumstances which required us to evaluate impairment of any of these assets during the years ended december  or preservation of assets held for development we evaluate the carrying value of assets held for development whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we review the asset for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
the asset is not impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  then an impairment charge is recorded  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model  which is based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year free cash flow multiples 
at december  and  the capitalized costs related to the echelon project of billion  included land  construction in progress and the central energy facility 
the construction and development costs consist primarily of site preparation work  underground utility installation and infrastructure and common area development 
professional and design fees include architectural design  development and permitting fees  inspections  consulting and legal fees 

table of contents the suspension of development on the echelon project implied that the carrying amounts of the assets related to the development may not be recoverable  therefore  we performed impairment tests of these assets  during the years ended december  and this impairment test was comprised of a future undiscounted cash flow analysis  and contemplated several viable alternative plans for the future development of echelon 
we did not identify any events or circumstances which required us to evaluate impairment of any of these assets during the year ended december  the impairment tests performed during the years ended december  and analyzed three scenarios one such scenario includes the outright sale of the project as is  which is primarily based upon land value 
we considered the land value by analyzing recent sales transactions of sites with similar characteristics such as location  zoning  access  and visibility  to establish a general understanding of the potential comparable sales 
the recoverability under this option represented any excess sales price  net of estimated selling costs  from the land over the carrying value of the assets  including land  held for development 
another scenario is the full development of the project  as designed  at a later date 
the cash inflows related to this option represent the revenue projections for the individual components associated with each planned construction element casino  hotel  food and beverage  retail  convention and other  based upon the estimated respective dates of completion and particular graduated absorption rates 
these projections are offset by outflows for incurred and estimated costs to complete the development 
for costs already incurred  and to compensate for potential losses due to the delay  we adjusted for i physical deterioration  ii functional obsolescence  and iii economic obsolescence 
physical deterioration is impairment to the condition of the asset brought about by wear and tear  disintegration  and or the action of the elements 
functional obsolescence is the impairment in the efficiency of the asset brought about by such factors as inadequacy or change in technology that affect the asset 
economic obsolescence is the impairment in the desirability of the asset arising from external economic forces  building code enhancements or changes in supply and demand relationships 
for estimated costs to complete  we applied selected construction expense growth rates to our present cost analysis 
in addition to these hard and soft construction costs  we estimated outflows for preservation costs that are intended and required to maintain the development site and the existing structures as well as development materials for future use 
these net outflows were incrementally added to our estimated operating and ongoing maintenance costs  to establish the undiscounted net cash flow of the project 
our final scenario is a scaled down version of the full project  whereby only certain components would be developed 
this cash flow projection considered the inflows and outflows discussed above  with relevant curtailment for revenue from  and costs related to  the amenities not completed 
because no specific strategic plan can be determined with certainty at this time  the analysis considered the net cash flows related to each alternative  weighted against its projected likelihood 
the outcome of this evaluation resulted in the determination that there was no impairment of the assets held for development during the years ended december   or the estimated weighted net undiscounted cash flows from the project exceeded the current carrying value of the assets held for development by approximately billion as of december application of acquisition method accounting acquisition of ip casino resort spa ip on october   we consummated the acquisition of ip casino resort spa ip in biloxi  mississippi pursuant to an agreement for purchase and sale  under which the seller agreed to sell and transfer  and the company agreed to purchase and assume  certain assets and liabilities  respectively  related to the imperial palace biloxi  on an as is basis 
the net purchase price was approximately million 
in addition to the net purchase price  the company intends to perform certain capital improvement projects with respect to the property at an estimated cost of million 
the business combination resulted in the recording of a bargain purchase gain of approximately million  due to the excess fair value of net identifiable assets over the total consideration  and is reflected in other income on the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  the company has applied the acquisition method of accounting to this business combination  which promulgates the following identifying the acquirer the company did not acquire the equity interests of the sellers  but rather acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities 
however  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the company constitute a business  as all associated processes and productive outputs were obtained in the transaction 
the company created a wholly owned subsidiary to record the activities of this business 
determining the acquisition date title to all acquired assets  transfer of licensing requirements and the assumption of certain liabilities occurred upon closing  at midnight on october  
table of contents recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed the company has completed its valuation procedures  and the resulting fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities has been recorded based upon our consideration of an independent valuation of the business enterprise and ip s tangible and intangible assets 
recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase the company had recorded a bargain purchase in this business combination  as further discussed below  because the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the consideration transferred 
the application of the acquisition method accounting guidance had the following effects on our consolidated financial statements i we measured the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities in accordance with promulgated valuation recognition and measurement provisions and recognized such in our consolidated balance sheet as of october   and ii we have reported the operating results of ip in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the period from october  through december  we engaged third party valuation expertise to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships  trademark and any other significant tangible assets or liabilities  such as long lived property 
enterprise value allocation methodology requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis 
if estimates or assumptions used to complete the enterprise valuation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made  the resulting difference could materially affect the fair value of net assets 
we will undertake impairment tests of the indefinite lived intangible assets  in accordance with our policy 
as part of the valuation  we acquired intangible assets  including the ip trademark 
the fair value of the identified intangible assets was determined using a cash flow model following the income approach 
the value of the trademark relied upon a relief from royalty method  which discounts a steam of payments associated with the right to use such name 
the value of customer relationships followed a multi period excess earnings method  which is an application of the discounted cash flow method and computes the present value of after tax cash flows attributable to the associated future income stream 
as a result of the business combination and fair value analysis  we recorded million for the ip trademark 
the financial position of ip is consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   and in total  we recorded the fair value of its assets of million  and fair value of liabilities assumed of million 
in total  the assets of ip acquired represent of our consolidated total assets at december consolidation of borgata upon effectively obtaining control of borgata  we were required to apply acquisition method accounting in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for business combinations 
the application of the acquisition method accounting guidance had the following effects on our consolidated financial statements i our previously held equity interest was measured at a provisional fair value at the date control was obtained  ii we recognized and measured the identifiable assets and liabilities in accordance with promulgated valuation recognition and measurement provisions  and iii we recorded the noncontrolling interest held in trust for the economic benefit of mgm as a separate component of our stockholders equity 
the provisional fair value measurements and estimates of these items were subsequently refined during the one year measurement period 
we had provisionally recorded these fair values using an earnings valuation multiple model  because  at the time of the preliminary estimate  we had not completed our procedures with respect to the independent valuation of the business enterprise and borgata s tangible and intangible assets 
our subsequent valuation procedures have necessitated a revision of the valuation of the provisional assets and liabilities 
thus  upon finalization of our valuation  certain measurement period adjustments were identified and retrospectively recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these measurement period adjustments materially shifted the value of certain tangible and intangible assets 
we have applied the measurement period adjustments retrospectively to the consolidated balance sheet reported as of december  however  the impact on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   as retrospectively adjusted  to the statement as reported was not material  and was therefore not adjusted for any measurement period adjustments 
the revisions to the provisional values of assets consists of reallocations of certain tangible assets and the recordation of other intangible assets  the accrual of certain liabilities  including the recording of the deferred tax effect of the appreciated asset values  and the resulting effect on the fair value of the controlling and noncontrolling interests 
we determined the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships  a trademark and any other significant tangible assets or liabilities  such as long lived property 
the enterprise value allocation methodology required management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimated the fair 
table of contents value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis 
if estimates or assumptions used to complete the enterprise valuation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made  the resulting difference could materially affect the fair value of net assets 
we will continue to perform impairment tests of the indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with our existing policy  as discussed below 
additionally  given the anticipated sale of the mgm interest  we will maintain a heightened awareness of any potential triggering events which would indicate a possible impairment of the intangible assets or long lived assets 
the financial position of borgata is consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and  and during the year ended december   we recorded a step up to the basis of borgata s historical financial statements of million  which is an appreciation over their historical book basis of approximately 
in total  the fair value of the assets consolidated as a result of this change in control represents approximately of our consolidated total assets at december  valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets gaming license rights represent the value of the license to conduct gaming in certain jurisdictions  which is subject to highly extensive regulatory oversight and a limitation on the number of licenses available for issuance with these certain jurisdictions 
these assets  considered indefinite lived intangible assets  are not subject to amortization  but instead are subject to an annual impairment test  performed in the second quarter of each year  and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
if the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
license rights are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach  and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relief from royalty method 
the value of gaming licenses is determined using a multi period excess earnings method  which is a specific discounted cash flow model 
the value is determined at an amount equal to the present value of the incremental after tax cash flows attributable only to future gaming revenue  discounted to present value at a risk adjusted rate of return 
with respect to the application of this methodology  we used the following significant projections and assumptions gaming revenues  gaming operating expenses  general and administrative expenses  tax expense  terminal value  and discount rate 
these projections are modeled for a five year period 
the carrying value of our gaming license rights at both december  and was million  or and of our consolidated total assets  respectively  and the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by million and million  or by a multiple of and  respectively 
trademarks are based on the value of our brand  which reflects the level of service and quality we provide and from which we generate repeat business 
trademarks are valued using the relief from royalty method  which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks  we would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in return for the right to use their name 
by virtue of this asset  we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of our ownership of the brand name 
we used the following significant projections and assumptions to determine value under the relief from royalty method revenue from gaming and hotel activities  royalty rate  general and administrative expenses  tax expense  terminal growth rate  discount rate  and the present value of tax benefit 
the projections underlying this discounted cash flow model were forecasted for fifteen years 
applying the selected pretax royalty rates to the applicable revenue base in each period yielded pretax income for each property s trademarks and trade name 
these pretax totals were tax effected utilizing the applicable tax rate to arrive at net  after tax cash flows 
the net  after tax flows were then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate 
the present value of the after tax cash flows were then added to the present value of the amortization tax benefit considering the year amortization of intangible assets pursuant to recent tax legislation to arrive at the recommended fair values for the trademarks and trade names 
at december   the carrying value of our trademarks was million  which includes the addition of million related to the acquisition of ip and million related to the consolidation of borgata during the years ended december  and  respectively  the total of which represents of our total consolidated assets 
the fair value of our trademarks exceeded their carrying value by million  or  respectively 
at december   the carrying value of our trademarks was million  or of our consolidated total assets  and the fair value of our trademarks exceeded their carrying value by million  or  respectively 
these indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization  but are subject to an annual impairment test in the second quarter of each year and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
our impairment test  performed in the second quarter of did not result in any impairment of these intangible assets during the year ended december  we did however  perform an interim test with respect to the borgata trademark  and recorded a million impairment of the borgata trademark during the year ended december   based on a degradation in their forecasted revenues due to our consideration of certain facts and circumstances surrounding an adverse change in the business climate in atlantic city 
we believe our actual results have been adversely impacted by increased regional competition  and that in addition  our projected future results will be further impacted by cannibalization of our business upon the opening of a new property in atlantic city  which was announced in february 
table of contents specific to the value of borgata s trademark  a respective annual decline in their gaming revenues of  in hotel revenues of or an aggregate decline in both streams of would impact the fair value of the trademark by million  and result in a future impairment in our carrying value 
we evaluate whether any triggering events or changes in circumstances had occurred subsequent to our annual impairment test that would indicate an impairment condition may exist 
this evaluation required significant judgment  including consideration of whether there had been any significant adverse changes in legal factors or in our business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or likely sale or disposal of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
based upon this evaluation  we concluded that there had not been any triggering events or changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment condition existed as of december  if an event described above occurs  and results in a significant impact to our revenue and profitability projections  or any significant assumption in our valuations methods is adversely impacted  the impact could result in a material impairment charge in the future 
valuation of goodwill the authoritative guidance related to goodwill impairment requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually using a two step impairment test 
step one of the test is a screen used to identify whether or not goodwill impairment may exist 
in step one  an entity compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  goodwill impairment may exist 
step two of the test must then be performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
in step two  an entity compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill should be determined in the same manner that goodwill is measured in a business combination  that is  an entity must allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
we solicit third party valuation expertise to assist in the performance of the step one valuations of the goodwill of our reporting units 
we perform the test in the second quarter of our fiscal calendar year  using a weighting of two different approaches was employed to determine fair value i the income approach and ii the market approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow method  which focuses on the expected cash flow of the subject company 
in applying this approach  the cash flow available for distribution is calculated for a finite period of years 
cash flow available for distribution is defined  for purposes of this analysis  as the amount of cash that could be distributed as a dividend without impairing the future profitability or operations of the subject company 
the cash flow available for distribution and the terminal value the value of the subject company at the end of the estimation period are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of value of the business enterprise 
in the valuation of an asset  the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of the subject asset 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the subject asset 
the steps followed in applying this approach include estimating the expected after tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its life and converting these after tax cash flows to present value through discounting 
the discounting process uses a rate of return which accounts for both the time value of money and investment risk factors 
finally  the present value of the after tax cash flows over the life of the asset is totaled to arrive at an indication of the fair value of the asset 
the market approach is comprised of the guideline company method  which focuses on comparing the subject company to selected reasonably similar  or guideline  publicly traded companies 
under this method  valuation multiples are i derived from the operating data of selected guideline companies  ii evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the subject company relative to the selected guideline companies  and iii applied to the operating data of the subject company to arrive at an indication of value 
in the valuation of an asset  the market approach measures value based on what typical purchasers in the market have paid for assets which can be considered reasonably similar to those being valued 
when the market approach is utilized  data are collected on the prices paid for reasonably comparable assets 
adjustments are made to the similar assets to compensate for differences between reasonably similar assets and the asset being valued 
the application of the market approach results in an estimate of the price reasonably expected to be realized from the sale of the subject asset 
the two methodologies were weighted toward the income approach and toward the market approach  to arrive at an overall fair value 
at december  and  the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by million and million  or by a multiple of and  with no individual reporting unit having less than a coverage 
the carrying value of our goodwill at december  and was million  or and  respectively  of our consolidated total assets 
at such dates  we evaluated whether any triggering events or changes in circumstances had occurred subsequent to our annual impairment test that would indicate an impairment condition may exist 
this evaluation required significant 
table of contents judgment  including consideration of whether there had been any significant adverse changes in legal factors or in our business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or likely sale or disposal of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
based upon this evaluation  we concluded that there had not been any triggering events or changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment condition existed at either december  or although we satisfied step one by a fair margin for each reporting unit tested  certain underlying assumptions and variables could greatly impact the results of future tests 
on a macro economic level  we believe that over the next few years  several trends are expected to continue to adversely affect the gaming industry 
the most significant trends include i delayed development of new construction  ii increased bankruptcy filings  and iii decreased consolidation 
the impact of the weakening economy  credit crunch  and general outlook of the casino resort industry is illustrated through the recent trend of abandoned casino projects 
bankruptcy has served as a deterrent to deals because of the large decline in cash flow as well as significant increases in leverage 
debt to ebitda ratios for public companies has nearly doubled overall in the past few years  indicating that such a drastic increase shows the inability to service debt 
although we cannot control or influence the impact of these factors from a fair valuation perspective  they could nonetheless have a material effect on the results of valuation  particularly the guideline company method under the market approach  in the future 
additionally  several of the assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow method under the income approach could pose a high degree of sensitivity to the resulting fair value 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following total revenue  depreciation expense  depreciation overhang  tax expense and effective rates  debt free net working capital  capital additions  terminal year growth factor  discount rate and the capitalization rate 
a change in any of these variables that cause our undiscounted cash flows or terminal value or both to adversely and materially change would result in the failure of the step one test  and a resulting impairment of our goodwill in an amount up to its book value of million 
determination of self insured reserves the company is fully self insured for general liability costs and self insured for workers compensation costs up to a stop loss limit of million 
self insurance reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  case reserves as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
case reserves represent estimated liability for unpaid loss  based on a claims administrator s estimates of future payments on individual reported claims  including loss adjustment expenses lae 
generally  lae includes claims settlement costs directly assigned to specific claims  such as legal fees 
we estimate case and lae reserves on a combined basis  but do not include claim administration costs in our estimated ultimate loss reserves 
ibnr reserves include the provision for unreported claims  changes in case reserves  and future payments on reopened claims 
we have relied upon an industry based method to establish our self insurance reserves  which projects the ultimate losses estimated by multiplying the exposures by a selected ultimate loss rate 
the selected ultimate loss rates were determined based on a review of ultimate loss rates for prior years  adjusted for loss and exposure trend  and benefit level changes 
we believe this method best provides an appropriate result  given the maturing experience and relative stabilization of our claims history 
in previous years  and in certain instances  loss rates were based on industry loss development factors ldfs 
industry ldfs are from various national sources for workers compensation and general liability claims  and we utilize the most recent information available  although there is some lag time between compilation and publishing of such reports  during which unfavorable trends or data could emerge  which would not be reflected in our reserves 
for workers compensation  using payroll by state as weights  we calculate a weighted average industry ldf  for general liability claims  we use gross revenues as weights  and apply to a weighted average industry ldf to yield an initial expectation of the ultimate loss amount 
the paid ldfs are used to determine the percentage of the expected ultimate loss that is expected to be unpaid as of the reserving date 
this future unpaid percentage is multiplied by the expected ultimate losses to derive the expected future paid losses 
as a loss year matures  the expected future paid losses are replaced by actual paid losses 
the ldfs applied to determine the factors used to compute our workers compensation reserves have increased by approximately over the past three years 
using the year ending december  as a static period  average annual increases in these ldf based on the three four years  would result in an increase of million in our workers compensation reserves and guest claims respectively 
in the computation of workers compensation claims  we exclude any claim which has reached our stop loss limitation  and therefore  we do not include any allowance for expected recoverable from excess or reinsurance 
we are  however  contingently liable in the event such reinsurer cannot meet its obligations 
although we place this risk with insurers rated better than a with am best  a national insurance company rating agency  there can be no assurance that such reinsurer will be able to meet their obligations in the future 
at december   unpaid case reserves on claims in excess of million  which we have subrogated to the 
table of contents reinsurer  totaled million 
in estimating our reserves for unpaid losses  it is also necessary to project future loss payments 
actual future losses will not develop exactly as projected and may  in fact  vary significantly from the projections 
further  the projections make no provision for future emergence of new classes of losses or types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical database or that are not yet quantifiable 
additionally  our results are estimates based on long term averages 
actual loss experience in any given year may differ from what is suggested by these averages 
the sensitivity of key variables and assumptions in the analysis was considered 
key variables and assumptions include but are not limited to loss development factors  trend factors and the expected loss rates ratios used 
it is possible that reasonable alternative selections would produce materially different reserve estimates 
management believes the estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon this methodology  however  changes in key variables and assumptions used above  or generally in health care costs  accident frequency and severity could materially affect the estimate for these reserves 
provisions for deferred tax assets  certain tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions income taxes are recorded under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on more likely than not realization threshold 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with the usability of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before expiration  and tax planning alternatives 
the company s income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates 
the company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes  which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the position  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we have established contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures 
our tax reserves reflect management s judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
while we believe our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a taxing authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve 
with respect to these reserves  our income tax expense would include i any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances ie  new information surrounding a tax issue and ii any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period 
our tax reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of december  were million 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates  we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense  which could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
recently issued accounting pronouncements a variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and certain regulatory agencies 
because of the tentative and preliminary nature of such proposed standards  we have not yet determined the effect  if any  that the implementation of such proposed standards would have on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards update employer s participation in multiemployer benefit plans update in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued update which is an amendment to topic of the accounting standards codification asc 
the objective of update is to amend asc by increasing the quantitative and qualitative disclosures an employer 
table of contents is required to provide about its participation in significant multiemployer plans that offer pension or other post retirement benefits 
the objective of update is to enhance transparency of disclosures about the significant multiemployer plans in which an employer participates  the level of the employer s participation in those plans  the financial health of the plans  and the nature of the employer s commitments to the plans 
we adopted update during the year ended december  update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards update intangibles  goodwill and other update in september  the fasb issued update which is an amendment to asc topic the objective of update is to simplify how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic asc the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
previous guidance under topic asc required an entity to test goodwill for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill step one 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in update  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment will be effective for our fiscal year  and interim periods within the fiscal year beginning january   although early adoption is permitted 
update will not have a material impact on the computation of the impairment of goodwill or other intangibles 
accounting standards update presentation of comprehensive income update in june  the fasb issued update which is an amendment to topic asc the objective of update is to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
update provides an entity with the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
in a single continuous statement  the entity is required to present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with the total of comprehensive income in that statement 
in the two statement approach  an entity is required to present components of net income and total net income in the statement of net income 
the statement of other comprehensive income should immediately follow the statement of net income and include the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with a total for comprehensive income 
update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income  nor does update affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
update should be applied retrospectively and will be effective for our fiscal year  and interim periods within the fiscal year beginning january  update will not have a material impact on the computation of comprehensive income  but will require a revised presentation thereof 
accounting standards update deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update in december  the fasb issued update which is an update to asc topic update defers certain provisions of update  which required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement of operations and the statement of comprehensive income  as discussed above in update both for interim and annual financial statements 
accordingly  this requirement is indefinitely deferred and will be deliberated by the fasb at a future date 
during this time of deliberation  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before update all other requirements in update are not superseded or otherwise effected  including 
table of contents the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the effective date of update is for fiscal years and interim periods with those fiscal years beginning january  update will not have a material impact on the computation of comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market  short term and long term libor rates  and short term eurodollar rates  and their potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under ours and borgata s bank credit facilities 
borrowings under our amended credit facility are based upon  at our option  libor or the base rate  plus an applicable margin in either case 
the base rate under the amended credit facility is the highest of x bank of america s publicly announced prime rate  y the federal funds rate plus  or z the eurodollar rate for a one month period plus 
pursuant to the amended credit facility  i at any time and to the extent that the incremental term loan is a eurodollar rate loan  the incremental term loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each interest period at a rate per annual equal to the effective eurodollar rate for such period plus  and ii at any time and to the extent that the incremental term loan is a base rate committed loan  the incremental term loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the base rate for such interest period plus 
the applicable margin is a percentage per annum determined in accordance with a specified pricing grid based on the total leverage ratio 
the applicable margin on the outstanding balance on the extended revolving facility ranges from to if using libor  and from to if using the base rate 
outstanding borrowings under the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  accrue interest at a rate based upon either i the highest of a the agent bank s quoted prime rate  b the one month eurodollar rate plus  and c the daily federal funds rate plus  and in any event not less than such highest rate  the base rate  or ii the eurodollar rate  plus with respect to each of clause i and ii an applicable margin as provided in the borgata bank credit facility  as amended 
in addition  a commitment fee is incurred on the unused portion of the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  ranging from per annum to per annum 
we also attempt to manage the impact of interest rate risk on boyd s long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company previously entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap arrangements in order to manage interest rate risk relating to its amended credit facility 
we were a party to certain floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million  whereby we received payments based upon the three month libor and made payments based upon a stipulated fixed rate 
these interest rate swap agreements modified the company s exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
the interest rate swap agreements terminated on june  the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the weighted average variable rates are based upon prevailing interest rates 
the scheduled maturities of our long term debt outstanding for the years ending december are as follows

based on december  debt levels  a basis point change in libor or the base rate would cause the annual interest costs to change by approximately million and million for boyd and borgata respectively

the estimated fair values of our senior subordinated and senior notes and borgata s senior secured notes are based on quoted market prices as of december  debt included in the other category is fixed rate debt that is due march and is not traded and does not have an observable market input  therefore  we have estimated its fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach  after giving consideration to the changes in market rates of interest  creditworthiness of both parties  and credit spreads
