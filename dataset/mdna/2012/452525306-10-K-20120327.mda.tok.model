item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year product sales product sales for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  in domestic product sales increased by  or  during the year ended december   and international sales increased by  or  in comparison to for the three month period ended december   product sales increased by  or  in comparison to the three month period ended december  we believe that sales of our products were influenced by the increased price of milk  cows and calves and partially offset by the increased cost of feed 
competition for resources that dairy producers allocate to their calf enterprises has been increased by the many new products that have been introduced to the calf market 
while milk prices have improved recently  much of this gain has been offset by increases in the cost of feed 
even in this challenging market  our lead product  first defense  continues to benefit from wide acceptance by dairy and beef producers as an effective tool to prevent bovine enteritis scours in newborn calves 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our  th dose of first defense 
the third quarter of marked the th anniversary of the original usda approval of this product in we believe that these milestones demonstrate the value of our technology and the long term market acceptance of our product 
it is our production and customer service objective to ship orders within one day of receipt 
we have been operating in accordance with this objective since the third quarter of sales of first defense increased by during the year ended december  in comparison to domestic sales of first defense increased by  and international sales increased by 
sales of first defense are normally seasonal  with higher sales expected during the first quarter 
we have been experiencing consistently positive sales growth of first defense since the fourth quarter of  as demonstrated below immucell corporation fiscal year over fiscal year fourth quarter over fourth quarter third quarter over third quarter second quarter over second quarter first quarter over first quarter fourth quarter over fourth quarter we believe that the growth in sales of first defense may reflect  at least in part  the success of our strategic decision to invest in additional sales and marketing efforts 
we launched a communications campaign at the end of that is highlighting how the unique features of first defense provide a dependable return on investment for producers 
effective for and for  and renewable for and if certain sales growth objectives are met  we entered into a sales and marketing collaboration with agrilabs  under which the agrilabs sales and marketing teams are working with us to expand market demand for first defense 
we are investigating additional opportunities to commercialize our whey protein purification technologies in the nutritional and feed supplement markets in different formats not regulated by the usda 
first defense technology tm is a unique whey protein concentrate that is purified utilizing our proprietary whey protein processing methods 
it does not carry the claims of our usda licensed product 
through our first defense technology tm  we are selling whey concentrate globulin proteins in different formats 
during the first quarter of  we initiated sales of our first defense technology tm in a bulk powder format no capsule  which is delivered with a scoop 
during the first quarter of  we initiated a limited launch of a tube delivery format of our first defense technology tm in a gel solution 
through two collaborations  we are working to expand sales of our first defense technology tm by accessing the us feed market 
during the first quarter of  agrilabs launched commercial sales of their product  colostrx  a colostrum supplement with first defense technology tm inside 
during the fourth quarter of  milk products  llc launched commercial sales of their product  ultra start plus  a colostrum replacer with first defense technology tm inside 
sales of wipe out dairy wipes decreased by during the year ended december  in comparison to we believe that sales growth potential for wipe out dairy wipes is limited because most of our sales of this product tend to be to smaller dairies that are under continued financial pressures 
such pressures are forcing many small dairy producers out of business 
while our product is a high quality tool  there are less expensive ways to sanitize a cow prior to milking  and many producers opt for a less expensive solution 
we are competing aggressively on selling price to earn new business against less expensive products and alternative teat sanitizing methods 
the other products we sell primarily into the dairy industry aggregated approximately of product sales during and sales of these products were higher in than the level of sales achieved in the other products we sell outside of the dairy and beef industries  principally isolate formerly known as crypto scan  aggregated and of product sales during the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of our bulk reagents for use in a drinking water test sold by others decreased by during the year ended december  in comparison to during  these sales were recorded during the fourth quarter 
during  these sales were recorded during the second quarter 
our animal health sales total product sales less sales of the water diagnostic reagents increased by during the year ended december  in comparison to this comparison more accurately reflects the growth of our core animal health business 
we generally held our product selling prices without increase during the seven year period ended december  during the first quarter of  we implemented a modest increase to the selling price of first defense 
we have implemented no significant price increases since then believing that we could benefit more from higher unit sales than through a higher average selling price per unit 
immucell corporation gross margin changes in the gross margin on product sales are summarized in the following table for the respective periods in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  increase amount gross margin   percent of product sales the gross margin as a percentage of product sales was and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
this compares to gross margin percentages of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we experienced an unusually low gross margin percentage during in comparison to those achieved in other periods 
our current annual target is to maintain the gross margin percentage at approximately 
a number of factors account for the variability in our costs 
we expect some fluctuations in gross margin percentages from quarter to quarter 
the gross margin on first defense is affected by biological yields from our raw material  which do fluctuate over time 
more generally  costs for production of first defense and wipe out dairy wipes have increased due to increased labor costs and expenses associated with our efforts to sustain compliance with cgmp regulations in our production processes 
like most manufacturers in the us  we have been experiencing increases in the cost of raw materials that we purchase 
we have been able to minimize the impact of these cost increases by implementing yield improvements 
product mix also affects gross margin in that we earn a higher gross margin on first defense and a lower gross margin on wipe out dairy wipes

going forward  we expect to reduce our product development expenses  which expenses will continue to be focused on mast out and other improvements  extensions or additions to our first defense product line 
the other improvements  extensions  or additions to our current product line include the potential to prevent scours in calves caused by pathogens other than those within the current first defense disease claims e

these expenses have increased due principally to a strategic decision to invest more to support first defense sales and to prepare for a market launch of mast out

these product opportunities are generally less expensive to develop than the human health product opportunities that we had worked on during the s 
we funded most of our product development expenses principally from product sales and were profitable for each of the nine years in the period ended december  during the nine years of profitability from through  our cumulative investment in product development expenses of  was supported  in small part  by  in grant awards 
the investment of an additional  in product development expenses during   and brings our cumulative investment to  during the thirteen year period ended december  we may  on occasion  seek additional research grant support as a means of leveraging the funds that we are able to spend developing new products 
our strategic decision to continue developing mast out after the product rights were returned to us in has caused us to increase our spending on product development expenses that were previously funded by pfizer from late to mid after the nine consecutive years of profitability that we recorded during the years ended december  to december   we incurred net losses of    and  during the years ended december     and  respectively 
as we reduce product development spending on mast out  we expect to return to profitable operations 
we have not invested the time and resources to carefully make an exact projection about the timing or extent of our anticipated return to profitability 
we believe that the three key indicators that investors should watch going forward will be the gross margin on our product sales  our net operating income loss and our net income loss 
we estimate that it will require approximately  to complete the development of mast out and bring the product to market  sales of which are subject to fda approval 
this budget is comprised of costs primarily related to the manufacture of commercial inventory 
we are seeking to finance this investment with a combination of available cash  partner funding and debt 
outside funding is required to pay for the larger financial commitments required for manufacturing scale up and preparation of full scale validation batches of mast out 
by the second quarter of  we had advanced the product development effort internally to the point where we could begin earnest negotiations with prospective partners 
all anticipated initial discussions are now complete  and some prospective partners are conducting their due diligence 
it is difficult to predict when or if this partnering effort will be successful 
although these partnering discussions are taking longer than we would like or had initially anticipated  we believe that the commercial prospects for mast out warrant our continued efforts and patience with the process 
immucell corporation we had approximately  in available cash and short term investments as of december  we are using some of this cash to fund product development  principally mast out 
we continue to look for new product acquisition opportunities that would have a strategic fit with the products that we currently sell

we expect to return to positive net operating income before other revenues expenses  net and income taxes during during the third quarter of  we agreed to terms of certain credit facilities with td bank  na aggregating up to approximately  which are secured by substantially all of our assets 
these credit facilities are comprised of a  ten year mortgage loan  a  fifty four month note and a  line of credit 
proceeds from the  mortgage loan were received during the third quarter of proceeds from the  note were received during the first quarter of the  line of credit is available as needed 
we believe that this debt financing together with available cash and gross margin from ongoing product sales provides us with sufficient funding to finance our working capital requirements while completing the first submissions to the fda of all technical sections pertaining to mast out 
we chose debt financing because we believe that in this market environment  the option to generate funds through the sale of equity securities at an acceptable level of stockholder dilution is very unlikely 
as part of our sustained investment in compliance with cgmp regulations across our product lines and as we make other process improvements  we are investing in personnel  equipment and facility modifications to increase the efficiency and quality of our operations 
in  our board of directors authorized an investment of approximately  for capital expenditures facility modifications and production equipment 
as of january   we had remaining available authorization to spend up to  on capital expenditures  net of  in investments made from january  through december   which amount includes a  increase to this authorized limit that was approved by our board of directors during the fourth quarter of off balance sheet arrangements none immucell corporation critical accounting policies the financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  contingencies and the useful lives and carrying values of intangible and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of the business and understanding our financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
royalty income is recorded on the accrual basis based on sales as reported to us by our licensee pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
all research and development costs and patent costs are expensed as incurred 
inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are recorded at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on the first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
work in process and finished goods inventories include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that neither inflation nor interest rates nor currency exchange rates have had a significant effect on our revenues and expenses 
however  future increases in inflation or interest rates or the value of the us dollar could affect our customers and the demand for our products 
we hedged our interest rate exposure to a  mortgage with an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted a floating interest rate to the fixed rate of 
the interest rate on our  note is variable 
if the london interbank offered rate plus exceeds  our interest payments will increase over the current amount 
we hope to increase the level of our future sales of products outside the united states 
the cost of our products to international customers could be affected by currency fluctuations 
the decline of the us dollar against other currencies could make our products less expensive to international customers 
we do not anticipate that currency fluctuations will significantly affect our sales or the cost of operations
