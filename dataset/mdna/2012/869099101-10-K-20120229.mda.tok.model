foreclosed real estate is property acquired through foreclosure or other means and is recorded at the lower of the loan s carrying value or the fair market value of the related real estate collateral at the transfer date less estimated selling costs 
troubled debt restructurings are loans for which we  for legal or economic reasons related to a debtor s financial difficulties  have granted a concession to the debtor that we otherwise would not have considered 
concessions that result in the categorization of a loan as a troubled debt restructuring include reduction absolute or contingent of the stated interest rate  extension of the maturity date or dates at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk  reduction absolute or contingent of the face amount or maturity amount of the debt as stated in the instrument or other agreement  or

table of contents we conduct quarterly portfolio reviews of real estate construction loan relationships in excess of million in order to identify potential problem loans 
for those loan relationships under million  the evaluation of risk is based upon delinquency 
included in this review is a comparison of absorption numbers units leased or sold  market conditions  and performance to original projections 
lenders prepare cash flow projections for the loan being reviewed and all of the construction projects that the borrower may have financed with other lending institutions 
an analysis of these cash flow projections determines whether the borrowing entity s liquidity is sufficient to complete not only the project being financed by us but any other projects in the borrower s portfolio  as well 
the liquidity of any guarantors the secondary source for continuance of the project is also reviewed during this process to determine if it will support any extension of the project due to slower than expected absorption 
loans designated as potential problem loans in the real estate construction loan portfolio are reviewed quarterly by our loan review department loan review and executive management 
this review consists of an analysis of the project s historical results  the project s projected results over the next four quarters  current financial information of the borrower and any guarantors  and a fifteen month rolling cash flow of the projects financed by us and other lending institutions 
in these meetings  we determine which loans are to be placed on nonaccrual and any downgrades or upgrades in ratings 
all potential problem real estate construction loans are tested quarterly for impairment 
the loan must meet the following criteria or it will be considered impaired the debt coverage ratio dcr of the borrower must be at least x for the project 
dcr is defined as annualized cash flow available for debt service divided by annual debt service 
if the dcr of the borrower is less than x  then the ratio of global cash flow of the borrower plus the guarantor divided by annual debt service gcf must be greater than x 
if the dcr and the gcf are not greater than x  then a fifteen month rolling cash flow projection must show that the borrower guarantor will achieve a x dcr within six months 
this projection must be verified and supported by contracts or leases 
potential problem loans are generally assigned to our special asset group or work out department 
while the loans are assigned to these areas these groups work under the same process that was used to determine that the loan was impaired as described above to monitor the collectability of these loans 
collateral is appraised by outside vendors 
appraisals are generally kept current no more than one year old 
work out plans are established with loan benchmarks that  if achieved  will result in our upgrading the loan 
if it is not feasible to upgrade the loan  we will develop a plan to exit the loan through non bank financing  sale of assets  or an orderly liquidation 
we use independent third party appraisal firms to determine the value of collateral 
real estate construction collateral is generally valued on an annual basis  or in the event of deterioration in geographic areas of our foot print as demonstrated by analytics from regional and national publications  on an as needed basis 
for ongoing real estate construction projects  we use independent inspectors to verify the progress of construction 
other collateral based loans  such as loans secured by receivables and or inventory  are generally valued on an annual basis using balance sheet information and field examinations performed by independent auditors 
we also review the liquidity of any guarantors the secondary source for continuance of the project to determine if their liquidity will support any extension of the project due to slower than expected absorption 
if the result of any of the determinations set forth above is negative  we consider the loan to be impaired  and it is included in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
if a loan is determined to be impaired  the 
table of contents net realizable value of the underlying collateral is calculated by using a current appraisal  and any short fall is charged off 
all partially charged off loans become part of the calculation for the loan and lease loss reserve 
although our impairment and charge off analyses take into consideration the guarantor s demonstrated ability and willingness to service the debt  we do not carry any impaired loans at values in excess of the current appraisal due to the loan having a guarantor 
our evaluation of guarantors includes examining their financial wherewithal and their reputation and willingness to work with their lenders 
since the beginning of the global economic slowdown in  we have consistently assessed the probability for completion of a project by determining the guarantor s liquidity and the cash flow generated by the project based upon current absorption 
we believe that we are well equipped to evaluate the guarantors of loans 
more than half of our commercial real estate borrowers have been our customers for over ten years and in the market for at least fifteen years 
most of our employee lenders have been lenders within their specific markets for fifteen or more years  and those whose experience is less than that time period are supervised by people who have the experience 
therefore  we have a strong historical perspective as to how borrowers performed in the last major recession of to for those borrowers guarantors that do not have history dating back to the last major recession  third party credit checks are used to determine their history and  when appropriate  how they have performed when real estate projects have not gone as expected 
guarantors are required to provide us with copies of annual financial statements and tax returns  including all schedules 
these financial statements and tax returns are analyzed using variables such as total debt obligation including contingent liabilities an analysis of those contingent liabilities  the ability to service third party debt  and whether the cash that is left will support our loan  and a review of financial statements to determine living expenses 
these results are part of a fifteen month rolling projection of the borrower s and the guarantor s cash flow 
with respect to a potential problem loan  the rolling fifteen month cash flow projection requires verification of all cash or liquid investments each quarter 
in addition  we require that these statements are generally current to within one year 
charge offs are taken in the quarter that we determine that the loan is impaired 
we exercise our rights under the full extent of the law to pursue all assets of the borrower and guarantors 
troubled debt restructurings tdrs troubled debt restructurings have decreased significantly from million at december  to million at december  we consider all restructured loans to be impaired 
additional charge offs subsequent to the restructuring during the years ended december  and  totaled million and  respectively 
a borrower with a restructured loan must maintain a x dcr as a stand alone entity or a x gcf together with its guarantor 
if the borrower fails to maintain that ratio or cannot recover to a x dcr or gcf within a six month period  the restructured loan will be returned to nonaccrual status 
also  if a borrower is over ninety days past due  the restructured loan will be returned to nonaccrual status 
loans that have been restructured but have not recovered to a x dcr or gcf will remain on nonaccrual even when a forbearance agreement has been executed 
when the borrower achieves a dcr or gcf of x or greater  the loan will be returned to restructured accruing status so long as the loan is current as to the restructured terms 
at the time a loan is restructured  we consider the following factors to determine whether the loan should accrue interest whether there is six months of payment history under the current terms  whether the loan is current under the restructured terms  and whether we expect the loan to continue to perform under the restructured terms with a dcr or gcf of x 

table of contents we also review the financial performance of the borrower over the past year to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to the modified terms 
this review consists of an analysis of the borrower s historical results  the borrower s projected results over the next four quarters  current financial information of the borrower and any guarantors  and a fifteen month rolling cash flow of the borrower 
all troubled debt restructurings are reviewed quarterly to determine the amount of any impairment 
in situations where the restructuring results in an interest only period greater than three months but not longer than fourteen months  our analysis of the borrower s historical cash flow must conclude that the borrower can make the interest only payments 
furthermore  the fifteen month rolling projections must demonstrate that the borrower will achieve cash flow levels that will support a return to payments of principal and interest at a market rate within the timeframe prescribed in the forbearance agreement 
at the time of restructuring  the amount of the loan for which we are not reasonably assured of repayment is charged off  but not forgiven 
we have not had any additional charge offs for any portion of the loans after the initial charge offs were taken at the time of the restructuring for any of our troubled debt restructurings that accrue interest at the time the loans are restructured 
a borrower with a restructured loan must make six consecutive monthly payments at the restructured level and be current as to both interest and principal to be on accrual status 
furthermore  for a loan to be no longer considered restructured  it must cross over a calendar year end and be at a market rate of interest 
impaired loans of the million of impaired loans nonaccrual  non consumer relationships greater than million plus accruing restructured loans at december   million  or  had no related reserve 
the determination that no related reserve for these collateral dependent loans was required was based on the net realizable value of the underlying collateral 
every impaired loan has a net realizable value nrv that is based on a recent appraisal generally less than one year of the collateral 
that nrv is calculated by the loan officer  reviewed by loan review and finally reviewed by our credit risk department to insure that the calculation is correct 
if the nrv is greater than the loan amount  then no impairment loss exists 
if the nrv is less than the loan amount  the shortfall is rectified by a specific reserve for a period of ninety days to allow time for the borrower to pledge additional collateral 
if the borrower fails to pledge additional collateral  a charge off will occur 
in certain circumstances  however  a direct charge off may be taken at the time that the nrv calculation reveals a shortfall 
as part of our loan quality department meetings and loan work out meetings  these loans are reviewed quarterly to ensure that appraisals are kept current 
if  based on general economic and geographic information from outside sources  we believe that the value of collateral is decreasing  we will obtain a new appraisal and make adjustments accordingly 
charge offs only are taken based on the fair market value of the underlying collateral  as determined from a current appraisal 
all partially charged off loans remain on nonaccrual status until they are brought current as to both principal and interest and have six months of payment history 
all impaired loans have an independent third party appraisal to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral 
once we have identified further deterioration of an impaired loan  we obtain an updated appraisal 
prior to receiving the updated appraisal  we will establish a specific reserve for that estimated deterioration  based upon our assessment of market conditions 
once the updated appraisal is received  the book value of the loan is adjusted to its fair value as determined by the appraisal 

table of contents loans that are determined to be impaired are written down to their current value  based upon a current appraisal at the time of impairment 
no additional value is assigned to any guarantee with regard to this appraisal 
we exercise our rights under the full extent of the law to pursue all assets of the borrower and guarantors 
potential problem loans potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing under contract but for which potential credit problems have caused us to place them on our internally monitored loan list 
the decrease in potential problem loans  which are not included in table  can be attributed to a stabilization of the difficult economic conditions 
continuing difficulties in the economy and the accompanying impact on these borrowers  as well as future events  such as regulatory examination assessments  may result in these loans and others not currently so identified being classified as non performing assets in the future 
table potential problem loans by loan category december  december  december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate construction real estate secured residential real estate secured commercial total potential problem loans loans with principal and or interest delinquent ninety days or more and still accruing interest totaled million at december   a decrease of million  from million at december  continued difficulties in the economy may adversely affect certain other borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond ninety days or to be placed on non accrual status because of the uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans

this review includes a stress test for an increase of in interest rates  we hold credit quality meetings during the second month of each quarter to review all criticized and classified loans 
this includes reviewing global cash flows and stress testing for an increase of in interest rates  we complete a fifteen month rolling projection of potential non accrual loans  charge offs  foreclosed assets  loans ninety days past due and still accruing  total delinquencies  troubled debt restructurings  specific reserves  and recoveries over million during the third month of every quarter 
these projections are reviewed and discussed by executive management  we hold monthly meetings with our work out officers to review their portfolios and strategy to either upgrade or exit particular credit relationships  
table of contents we have instituted an ongoing review in our consumer lending area of all home equity line of credit loans to determine which property values and fico scores have been negatively affected  and we are in the process of implementing risk based pricing to reflect the cost of loans progressing through our risk rating system 
we believe that will be better than  but still a challenging year  with the effects of the recession continuing to affect the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate  and consumer credit segments 
however  we also believe that we have the proper monitoring systems in place to recognize issues in an appropriate time frame and to minimize the effect on our earnings 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
this test  which requires significant judgment and analysis  involves discounted cash flows and market price multiples of non distressed financial institutions 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of  and determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its book value  and there was no goodwill impairment 
however  at september   having taken into consideration current market conditions  we decided that it would be prudent to perform interim goodwill impairment tests for our bank reporting unit and our wealth management reporting unit 
we determined  as of september   that there was no goodwill impairment  as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its book value 
based upon our analyses at december   the fair value of the bank reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by  the fair value of the wealth management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by  and the fair value of the property and casualty insurance reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
as a result of this analysis  we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of goodwill for possible future impairment as conditions warrant

this prepayment was funded by reducing federal funds sold by million  selling million of investment securities with an average yield of at an after tax loss of  and borrowing short term million

capital adequacy the maintenance of a strong capital base at the parent company level as well as at the bank level is an important aspect of our philosophy 
we and the bank have leverage and risk weighted ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and each entity is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
in september  the basel committee on banking supervision released revisions to recommended capital requirements  which are referred to as basel iii 
our capital ratios are well in excess of these new requirements 
these new ratio requirements are still considered preliminary  and there is a prolonged implementation time frame 
we will monitor any proposed clarifications of these benchmarks 
for additional information related to our risk based capital ratios  see note capital adequacy to the consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item market risks 

table of contents the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include equity market price risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of our operations  foreign currency and commodity price risk are not significant to us 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk related to market fluctuations of equity prices in the securities markets 
while we do not have significant risk in our investment portfolio  market price fluctuations may affect fee income generated through our asset management operations 
generally  our fee structure is based on the market value of assets being managed at specific time frames 
if market values decline  our fee income may also decline 
liquidity risk the maintenance of adequate liquidity the ability to meet the cash requirements of our customers and other financial commitments is a fundamental aspect of our asset liability management strategy 
our policy of diversifying our funding sources purchased funds  repurchase agreements  and deposit accounts allows us to avoid undue concentration in any single financial market and also to avoid heavy funding requirements within short periods of time 
at december   our bank subsidiary had approximately million available under a collateralized line of credit with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  and billion more would have been available provided that additional collateral had been pledged 
in addition  at december   we had unused federal funds lines of million and aggregate brokered certificates of deposits of only million 
in addition  we have pledged certain auto leases  certain auto loans  certain commercial finance leases  and certain investment securities to obtain collateralized borrowing availability at the federal reserve s discount window 
at december   we had unused collateralized availability of million 
liquidity  however  is not entirely dependent on increasing our liability balances 
liquidity is also evaluated by taking into consideration maturing or readily marketable assets 
unrestricted short term investments totaled million at december   and represented additional sources of liquidity 
management believes these sources of liquidity are sufficient to support our banking operations 
interest rate risk the management of interest rate risk focuses on controlling the risk to net interest income and the associated net interest margin as the result of changing market rates and spreads 
interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the repricing and rate structure of the interest bearing assets and liabilities 
our goal is to control risk exposure to changing rates within management s accepted guidelines to maintain an acceptable level of risk exposure in support of consistent earnings 
we employ a variety of methods to monitor interest rate risk 
these methods include basic gap analysis  which points to directional exposure  routine rate shocks simulation  and evaluation of the change in economic value of equity 
board directed guidelines have been adopted for both the rate shock simulations and economic 
table of contents value of equity exposure limits 
by dividing the assets and liabilities into three groups fixed rate  floating rate  and those which reprice only at our discretion strategies are developed to control the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
our interest rate risk using the static gap analysis is presented in table this method reports the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a specific point in time 
management uses the static gap methodology to identify our directional interest rate risk 
table also illustrates our estimated interest rate sensitivity periodic and cumulative gap positions as calculated as of december  and these estimates include anticipated prepayments on commercial and residential loans  and mortgage backed securities  in addition to certain repricing assumptions relative to our core deposits 
traditionally  an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities over a given time frame is considered asset sensitive  and one with more liabilities repricing than assets is considered liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive institution will generally benefit from rising rates  and a liability sensitive institution will generally benefit from declining rates 
static gap analysis is widely accepted because of its simplicity in identifying interest rate risk exposure  but it ignores market spread adjustments  the changing mix of the balance sheet  planned balance sheet management strategies  and the change in prepayment assumptions

the financial simulation model calculates the income effect and the economic value of assets  liabilities and equity at current and forecasted interest rates  and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the income effect and economic value of defined categories of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on embedded options  prepayments  early withdrawals  and weighted average contractual rates and terms 
for economic value calculations  the model also considers discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the economic values of longer term fixed rate financial 
table of contents instruments are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
adjustable rate and variable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in economic value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next contractual interest rate repricing date  unless subject to rate caps and floors 
a portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential mortgage loans containing embedded options  which permit the borrower to repay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s susceptibility for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate versus the contractual interest rate of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit and the availability of refinancing at attractive terms in addition to general changes in customers needs 
refinancing may also depend upon economic and other factors in specific geographic areas that affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short term and long term interest rates 
changes in market rates and general economic conditions impact our organization s mortgage backed security portfolio 
this will have an associated change on our sensitivity position in changing economic times 
savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice 
a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable  resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
our floating rate loan portfolio is primarily indexed to national interest rate indices 
the portfolio is funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb borrowings 
a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes to the different indices resulting in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  such financial instruments 
basis risk is the result of this inconsistent change in the indices  with historical relationships not always being a good indicator

while we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading  we consider it prudent to use certain derivative instruments to add stability to our interest income and expense  to modify the duration of specific assets and liabilities  and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
additionally  we execute derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies

supplemental reporting of non gaap based financial measures return on average tangible equity is a non gaap based financial measure calculated using non gaap amounts 
the most directly comparable measure is return on average equity  which is calculated using gaap based amounts 
we calculate return on average tangible equity by excluding the balance of intangible assets and their related amortization expense from our calculation of return on average equity 
management uses the return on average tangible equity in order to review our core operating results 
management believes that this is a better measure of our performance 
in addition  this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies  which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of risk based capital ratios 
a reconciliation of return on average equity to return on average tangible equity is set forth below 
return on average equity gaap basis effect of excluding average intangible assets and related amortization return on average tangible equity net interest income taxable equivalent basis our major source of operating revenues is net interest income  which increased to million in  as compared to million in net interest income as a percentage of net interest income plus other income was for the twelve months ended december   for the twelve months ended december   and for the twelve months ended december  the million increase in our net interest income in  as compared to  primarily was the result of an increase in our net interest margin of nine basis points  from to 
the increase in our margin primarily was caused by a decrease in our time deposit costs of one hundred four basis points from to  as a significant portion of those accounts repriced in provision and allowance for loan and lease losses although we continued to experience a challenging operating environment throughout  we saw some signs of stabilization 
as a result  we decreased our provision for loan and lease losses in accordance with our assessment process  which took into consideration a million decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases since december   as noted in table the provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  was of period end loans and leases  or million  and of period end loans and leases  or million  at december

service charges on deposit accounts 
the decrease primarily was the result of changes in customers behavior regarding overdrafts 
asset management fees 
the increase primarily was due to the recovery in the stock market  resulting in higher management fees 
other commissions and fees 
the decrease primarily is the result of the elimination of noninterest income relating to interest only strips as a result of the consolidation of two variable interest entities on january  net realized gain on securities

table of contents fdic insurance 
the decrease in fdic insurance expense primarily was the result of a million special assessment incurred in may  as determined by the fdic 
legal fees 
the increase in legal fees primarily was the result of credit issues 
income taxes our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the increase in our rate in was due to the significant increase in pretax book income in relative to with the exception of pretax book income  items impacting the effective rate in  including tax advantaged investment and loan income  were comparable to financial condition total assets at december   were billion  an increase of when compared to total assets of billion at december  loans and leases  decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  total deposits increased to billion at december   from billion at december  equity capital at december  was billion  relatively unchanged from december  when equity capital was also billion 
the components of shareholders equity  however  changed due to the issuance of million common shares in march and the redemption of the million of preferred stock held by the u 
s 
treasury also in as a result  book value per common share was at december  and at december  fair value measurements and the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities at december   susquehanna had made no elections to use fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets and financial liabilities not previously carried at fair value 
in addition  non financial assets and non financial liabilities have not been measured at fair value because we have made the determination that the impact on our financial statements would be minimal 
investment securities available for sale securities increased million at december   compared to december  as a result of the decrease in total loan balances and the increase in total deposit balances  we used the excess funds to purchase available for sale securities 
at december   we held no securities of any one issuer other than securities of us government agencies and corporations  which  by regulation  may be excluded from this disclosure where the aggregate book value exceeded of shareholders equity 
loans and leases as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities  we  as the primary beneficiary of two securitization trusts  were required to consolidate the trusts as of january  at december   the aggregate balance of the loans held by the trusts that can be used only to settle obligations of the trusts was million 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we concluded that  due to recent changes in accounting guidance and market conditions  it was highly unlikely that the home equity line of credit loans held for sale would be sold and securitized 
therefore  on march   we transferred million of home equity line of credit loans held for sale to held for investment 

table of contents throughout  the difficulties and uncertainty within the economy continued to affect demand for loans among credit worthy borrowers 
many businesses in our markets have been proceeding cautiously and have learned to do more with less 
as a result  loans and leases  net of unearned income and excluding the loans of the securitization trusts discussed above  decreased  from billion at december   to billion at december  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans declined by million including charge offs of million  while real estate construction loans  which we consider to be higher risk loans  declined by million including charge offs of million 
this decrease in real estate construction loans was primarily due to our continuing plan to decrease that portfolio  thereby reducing our exposure in a segment that has been particularly stressed during this recession 
consumer loans  however  increased by million since december   and loans secured by residential real estate excluding the loans of the securitizations trusts also increased  by million  during the same period 
risk assets nonaccrual loans and leases decreased from million at december   to million at december  the net decrease was primarily the result of the resolution of many real estate construction credits during as a result  total nonperforming assets as a percentage of period end loans and leases plus foreclosed real estate decreased from at december  to at december  real estate construction at december   real estate construction loans comprised only of our total loan and lease portfolio but accounted for of total nonaccrual loans and leases  of our allowance for loan and lease losses  and for the year ended december   this loan type accounted for of total net charge offs 
as a result  we consider these real estate construction loans to be higher risk loans 
to mitigate the risk of continued significant losses with regard to this portfolio  we have tightened the advance ratios for raw land  from to of appraised value or cost  whichever is less  for land approved unimproved  from to  for land approved improved  from to  and for construction of houses  apartments  or commercial buildings  from to 
troubled debt restructurings tdrs troubled debt restructurings have increased significantly from million at december  to million at december  we consider all restructured loans to be impaired 
none of our tdrs have required additional charge offs subsequent to the restructuring during the years ended december  and impaired loans of the million of impaired loans nonaccrual  non consumer relationships greater than million plus accruing restructured loans at december   million  or  had no related reserve 
the determination that no related reserve for these collateral dependent loans was required was based on the net realizable value of the underlying collateral 
potential problem loans loans with principal and or interest delinquent ninety days or more and still accruing interest totaled million at december   an increase of million  from million at december  continued difficulties in the economy may adversely affect certain other borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond ninety days or to be placed on non accrual status because of the uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans 

table of contents goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of  and determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its book value  and there was no goodwill impairment 
however  at december   having taken into consideration current market conditions  we decided that it would be prudent to perform interim goodwill impairment tests for our bank reporting unit and our wealth management reporting unit 
based upon our analyses at december   the fair value of the bank reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by  and the fair value of the wealth management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of goodwill for possible future impairment as conditions warrant 
deposits total deposits increased million  or  from december  to december  time deposits decreased while our core deposits  which consist of noninterest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing demand deposits  and savings deposits increased 
these changes  in part  reflect the results of our continuing strategy to improve our mix of deposits by allowing high cost  single service certificates of deposit to run off 
we do not rely upon time deposits of million or more as a principal source of funds  as they represent of total deposits
