item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since we provide diversified general contracting  construction management and design build services to private clients and public agencies throughout the world 
our construction business is conducted through four basic segments or operations civil  building  specialty contractors and management services 
our civil segment specializes in public works construction and the repair  replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure  including highways  bridges  mass transit systems and water and wastewater treatment facilities  primarily in the western  northeastern and mid atlantic united states 
our building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets  including the hospitality and gaming  transportation  healthcare  municipal offices  sports and entertainment  educational  correctional facilities  biotech  pharmaceutical and high tech markets 
our specialty contractors segment specializes in plumbing  hvac  electrical  mechanical  and pneumatically placed concrete for a full range of civil  building and management services construction projects in the industrial  commercial  hospitality and gaming  and transportation end markets  among others 
our management services segment provides diversified construction and design build services to the us military and federal government agencies  as well as surety companies and multi national corporations in the united states and overseas 
the contracting and management services that we provide consist of general contracting  pre construction planning and comprehensive management services  including planning and scheduling the manpower  equipment  materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms and specifications contained in a construction contract 
we also offer self performed construction services including site work  concrete forming and placement  steel erection  electrical and mechanical  plumbing and hvac 
we provide these services by using traditional general contracting arrangements  such as fixed price  guaranteed maximum price and cost plus fee contracts and  to a lesser extent  construction management or design build contracting arrangements 
in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into arrangements with other contractors  referred to as joint ventures  for certain construction projects 
each of the joint venture participants is usually committed to supply a predetermined percentage of capital  as required  and to share in a predetermined percentage of the income or loss of the project 
generally  each joint venture participant is fully liable for the obligations of the joint venture 
during  we completed the execution of our acquisition strategy to expand our business both vertically and geographically and provide synergies and opportunities to enhance our margins through an increase in the volume of our self performed work  coupled with an increased volume of higher margin public works projects in our civil and building segments 
we also completed a reorganization which resulted in the formation of the specialty contractors segment 
our specialty contractors segment is well positioned geographically to enable us to capitalize on new work opportunities and to strengthen our position as a full service contractor with greater control over scheduled delivery and risk management 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of billion  income from construction operations of million and net income of million as compared to revenues of billion  income from construction operations of million and net income of million in our operating results decreased in due primarily to the substantial completion of several successful large public works projects  and increased interest expense associated with our senior unsecured notes  term loan and borrowings under our revolving facility  offset by contributions from the recent acquisitions we have closed 
at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  and a ratio of long term debt to equity of to as compared to working capital of  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to and a ratio of long term debt to equity of to in these results reflect the additional leverage we took on during to finance our acquisition strategy 
our stockholders equity increased to billion as of december  from billion as of december   reflecting the operating results achieved in  despite difficult economic conditions particularly in the construction industry 
in addition to the billion of backlog acquired from our recent acquisitions  we received significant new contract awards  as well as additions to existing contracts  and ended the year with a contract backlog of billion  an increase of billion from billion as of december  
index recent developments tutor perini retained as contractor for hudson yards development in new york on january  we announced that we have been retained by related companies and oxford properties group as contractor for the hudson yards development in midtown manhattan hudson yards development 
we have also been retained for the construction of a residential tower being developed just south of the hudson yards on th street and th avenue in new york city 
the hudson yards development is a acre mixed use development accommodating over million square feet of commercial and residential space 
the master plan comprises approximately  residences  million square feet of state of the art commercial office space  a million square foot destination retail center with an over  square foot two level space of specialty destination restaurants  cafes  markets and bars  a five star hotel  a unique cultural space  and a new seat school  all carefully planned around acres of public open space 
physical construction operations are scheduled to begin mid the project will be booked into backlog as various phases are released 
completion of acquisition strategy  formation of specialty contractors segment and executive appointments with the acquisitions of five star electric corporation fse  wdf  inc wdf and nagelbush mechanical  inc 
nagelbush  collectively greenstar  lunda construction company lunda and becho  inc becho during the third quarter of  we have completed our acquisition strategy which also included the acquisitions of the following companies over the past year superior gunite  fisk electric company fisk  anderson companies anderson  and frontier kemper constructors frontier kemper 
on a combined basis  these companies had annual revenues of approximately billion and had backlog at the respective acquisition dates of approximately billion 
to finance this acquisition strategy  the company has utilized the entire proceeds from the offering of our million senior unsecured notes in october  and a million five year term loan with bank of america  na in august we believe that the benefits and opportunities associated with the acquisitions closed will more than outweigh the additional interest charges associated with our increased leverage 
during the third quarter of we completed a reorganization which resulted in the formation of the specialty contractors reporting segment 
the specialty contractors reporting segment consists of the following subsidiary companies wdf  fse  nagelbush  fisk  powerco electric corporation powerco  desert mechanical  inc dmi all previously included in the building reporting segment  and superior gunite previously included in the civil reporting segment 
on september   we appointed kenneth r 
burk  our former chief financial officer  as executive vice president and chief executive officer of the company s specialty contractors group  and the executive leadership of each of the subsidiaries discussed above will report to mr 
burk in his new role 
the reorganization enables the company to focus on vertical integration through increased self performed work capabilities while maintaining the specialty contractors business with third parties  and it will strengthen the company s position as a full service contractor with greater control over scheduled delivery and risk management 
on september   we also appointed michael j 
kershaw to replace mr 
burk as executive vice president and chief financial officer  effective september  prior to his hiring  mr 
kershaw has served in several executive and managerial positions with several of our peers in the construction industry 

index backlog analysis for our backlog of uncompleted construction work at december  was approximately billion  as compared to the billion at december  our backlog was bolstered by the addition of billion from our recent acquisitions closed during our legacy civil businesses contributed approximately billion of new awards and other adjustments to existing contracts during despite increased competitive bidding we have experienced in the civil markets 
building segment backlog decreased during the year as a result of the substantial completion of large hospitality and gaming and public works projects in las vegas  nevada 
however  as discussed above  we have significant pending awards associated with the hudson yards development project that we anticipate will enter our building segment s backlog in our specialty contractors segment backlog was bolstered primarily by the billion of backlog acquired in the greenstar merger 
we expect to leverage our specialty contractors segment for its strong presence in the northeastern markets as well as for the significant pending awards that we expect to convert to backlog in the near future 
our management services segment continues its focus on obtaining new work with various u 
s government agencies  and has maintained a consistent level of backlog throughout the following table provides an analysis of our backlog by business segment for the year ended december  backlog at new business revenues backlog at december  awarded recognized in december  in millions building civil specialty contractors management services total new business awarded consists of the original contract price of projects added to our backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our construction business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts and our joint venture contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our projects  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that the method of accounting for contracts is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements and estimating potential liabilities in conjunction with certain contingencies  including the outcome of pending or future litigation  arbitration or other dispute resolution proceedings relating to contract claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow us to produce materially reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability of skilled contract labor  the performance of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of major subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have many contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other without impacting overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex construction projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 

index when recording revenue on contracts relating to unapproved change orders and claims  we include in revenue an amount less than or equal to the amount of costs incurred by us to date for contract price adjustments that we seek to collect from customers for delays  errors in specifications or designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to scope or price  or other unanticipated additional costs  in each case when recovery of the costs is considered probable 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
the settlement of these issues may take years depending upon whether the item can be resolved directly with the customer or involves litigation or arbitration 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
the amount of unapproved change order and claim revenue is included in our consolidated balance sheets as part of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
these amounts include management s estimate of the probable cost recovery from the disputed claims considering such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
in the event that future facts and circumstances  including the resolution of disputed claims  cause us to reduce the aggregate amount of our estimated probable cost recovery from the disputed claims  we will record the amount of such reduction against earnings in the relevant future period 
method of accounting for contracts revenues and profits from our contracts and construction joint venture contracts are recognized by applying percentages of completion for the period to the total estimated revenues for the respective contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of the work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contracts 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is recorded during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
in the ordinary course of business  at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we prepare updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue  cost and profit or loss for each contract 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total forecasted revenue and costs  including unapproved change orders and claims  during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision become known 
the financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract 
an amount equal to the costs incurred that are attributable to unapproved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when realization is probable 
for a further discussion of unapproved change orders and claims  see item  business types of contracts and the contract process and item a  risk factors 
profit from unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the accounting period in which such amounts are resolved 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over contract billings to date 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings results when the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion accounting method  but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract and or costs  recorded at estimated realizable value  related to unapproved change orders or claims are incurred 
for unapproved change orders or claims that cannot be resolved in accordance with the normal change order process as defined in the contract  we may employ other dispute resolution methods  including mediation  binding and non binding arbitration  or litigation 
see item legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the prerequisite for billing unapproved change orders and claims is the final resolution and agreement between the parties 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings related to our contracts and joint venture contracts at december  is discussed above under use of estimates and in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not being amortized 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
construction contract backlog is amortized on a weighted average basis over the corresponding contract period 
customer relationships and certain trade names are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate intangible assets that are not being amortized at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

index we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment by applying a fair value test in the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or intangible assets should be evaluated 
the first step in the two step process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate the goodwill impairment 
the second step involves determining the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and calculating the implied fair value of goodwill 
to determine the fair value of the company and each of our reporting units  we perform both an income based valuation approach as well as market based valuation approach 
the income based valuation approach is based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future and it requires us to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit in a discrete period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate and a terminal value growth rate for the non discrete period 
the market based valuation approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units utilizes industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings 
once we have determined the company s fair value  an implied control premium is calculated based on the fair value and the market capitalization  calculated based on the company s average stock price for the days prior and subsequent to the date of the company s fair value assessment 
in evaluating whether the company s implied control premium is reasonable  we consider a number of factors including the following factors of greatest significance 
market control premium we compare the company s implied control premium to the average control premium paid in transactions of companies in the construction industry during the year of evaluation 
sensitivity analysis we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the minimum control premium required to recover the book value of the company at the testing date 
the minimum control premium required is then compared to the average control premium paid in transactions of companies in the construction industry during the year of evaluation 
impact of low public float and limited trading activity a significant portion of our common stock is owned by our chairman and ceo 
as a result  the public float of our common stock  calculated as the percentage of shares of common stock freely traded by public investors divided by our total shares outstanding  is significantly lower than that of our publicly traded peers 
this circumstance does not impact the fair value of the company  however based on our evaluation of third party market data  we believe it does lead to an inherent marketability discount impacting our stock price 
historically  the company s market capitalization has served as a reasonable proxy for the company s fair value 
given the recent decline in the company s stock price  which management attributes primarily to the limited trading activity of our common stock and current general economic conditions in the construction industry  the market capitalization is less than the stockholders equity of the company as reflected in its consolidated balance sheets 
in conjunction with our impairment evaluation analysis  we reconciled our assessed fair value to our market capitalization and concluded that the implied control premium associated with the fair value estimate was reasonable based in part on current comparable market data and given the impacts of the limited trading activity and general economic conditions that do not impact our expectation of future cash flows 
with regard to our reporting units  the fair values of our building and civil reporting units exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively  while the fair values of our specialty contractors and management services reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to the assumptions used to project these amounts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
the key assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our reporting units under the income based approach are as follows weighted average cost of capital used to discount our projected cash flows cash flows generated from new work awards projected operating margins 
index weighted average cost of capital rates used to discount our projected cash flows are developed via the capital asset pricing model which is primarily based upon market inputs 
we use discount rates that we feel are an accurate reflection of the risks associated with the forecasted cash flows of our respective reporting units 
to develop the cash flows generated from new work awards and future operating margins  we track prospective work for each of our reporting units primarily on a project by project basis as well as the estimated timing of when the work would be bid or prequalified  started and completed 
we also give consideration to our relationships with the prospective owners  the pool of competitors that are capable of performing large  complex work  changes in our business strategy including the opportunities associated with our focus on vertical integration  and our history of success in winning new work in each reporting unit 
with regard to operating margins  we give consideration to our historical reporting unit operating margins in the end markets that our prospective work opportunities are most significant  and changes in our business strategy including our focus on obtaining higher margin  complex public works projects 
we also estimate the fair value of our reporting units under a market based approach by applying industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings to our reporting units projected performance 
the conditions and prospects of companies in our industry depend on common factors such as overall demand for services 
changes in our assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and  therefore  could reduce or eliminate the excess of fair value over the carrying value of a reporting unit entirely and  in some cases  could result in an impairment 
such changes in assumptions could be caused by terminations  suspensions  reductions in scope or delays in the start up of the revenues and cash flows from our backlog as well as the prospective work we track reductions in available government  state and local agencies and non residential private industry funding and spending our ability to effectively compete for new work and maintain and grow our market penetration in the regions that we operate 
the majority of our projected cash flows were derived from contracts in backlog or those having a high probability of being awarded 
our ability to successfully control our costs  work schedule  and project delivery on a quarterly basis we consider whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets  including goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization might be impaired 
in conjunction with this analysis  we evaluate whether the company s current market capitalization is less than its stockholders equity and specifically consider changes in macroeconomic conditions  changes in general economic conditions in the construction industry including any declines in market dependent multiples  cost factors such as increases in raw materials  labor  or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows analyses  a reconciliation of the implied control premium to a current market control premium  target price assessments by third party analysts and how current market conditions impact our forecast of future cash flows including consideration of specific projects in backlog  pending awards  or large prospect opportunities 
we also evaluate our most recent assessment of the fair value for each of our reporting units  considering whether our current forecast of future cash flows are in line with those used in our annual impairment assessment and whether there are any significant changes in trends or any other material assumption used 
as of december  we have concluded that we do not have an impairment of our goodwill or our indefinite lived intangible assets and that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional goodwill disclosure 
fair value measurements we determined that we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities  valued at million as of december  all of these instruments are classified as available for sale securities as of december  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
in addition  we obtained an independent valuation of some of our auction rate security instruments and considered these valuations in determining the estimated fair values of the auction rate securities in our portfolio 
our analyses considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to full par value 

index in conjunction with our estimates of fair value at december   we deemed our investment in auction rate securities to be impaired by million in this impairment was deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we also utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair values of the contingent consideration involved in the purchases of several of our recently acquired entities 
we estimated these fair values based on an income approach which is based on the cash flows that the acquired entity is expected to generate in the future 
this approach requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
share based compensation we have granted restricted stock units and stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which corresponds to the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock option awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock option awards and the expected volatility of our stock price over the life of the awards 
we used the black scholes merton option pricing model to value our stock option awards  and utilized the historical volatility of our common stock as a reasonable estimate of the future volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the awards 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change which require the use of different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded through december  insurance liabilities we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of the losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverage 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
the estimate of our insurance liability within our self insured deductible limits includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on data compiled from historical experience 
actual experience could differ significantly from these estimates and could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we purchase varying levels of insurance from third parties  including excess liability insurance  to cover losses in excess of our self insured deductible limits 
currently  our self insured deductible limit for workers compensation  general liability and automobile coverage is generally million per occurrence  subject to a policy aggregate loss limitation based upon policy exposures 
in addition  on certain projects  we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of losses that arise from any subcontractor defaults 
our self insured deductible limit for subcontractor default on projects covered under our program is million per occurrence  subject to a million annual aggregate 
accounting for income taxes information relating to our provision for income taxes and the status of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in note  income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a key assumption in the determination of our book tax provision is the amount of the valuation allowance  if any  required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
we identified and reviewed potential tax uncertainties for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and determined that the exposure to those uncertainties did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as of december  defined benefit retirement plan the status of our defined benefit pension plan obligations  related plan assets and cost is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled employee benefit plans 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions which include  among other things  the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
the discount rate of used for purposes of computing the annual pension expense was determined at the beginning of the calendar year based upon an analysis performed by our actuaries which matches the cash flows of our plan s projected liabilities to bond investments of similar amounts and durations 
we plan to change the discount rate used for computing the annual pension expense to based upon a similar analysis by our actuaries 

index the estimated return on plan assets is primarily based on historical long term returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our targeted allocation of plan assets equity  fixed income and cash 
we plan to use a return on asset rate of in based on projected equity performance compared to long term historical averages 
the plans benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets on december    and by million  million and million  respectively 
accordingly  we recorded adjustments to our pension liability with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
effective june   all benefit accruals under our pension plan were frozen  however  the vested benefit was preserved 
due to the expected increase in amortization of prior years investment losses  we anticipate that pension expense will increase from million in to million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan are anticipated to be approximately million in cash contributions may vary significantly in the future depending upon asset performance and the interest rate environment 
results of operations compared to for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of  million  income from construction operations of million and net income of million as compared to revenues of  million  income from construction operations of million and net income of million for basic and diluted earnings per common share for were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for consistent with our strategy of focusing on higher margin public works projects and expanding our civil and specialty contracting presence  we experienced continued growth in the contributions from both our civil and specialty contractors segments 
we anticipate the contributions from public works projects to continue to represent a sizeable percentage of our operations 
our legacy building and civil segment operating results primarily reflect the substantial completion of several successful  large public works projects as well as the start up of several new public works projects in the eastern and western united states 
our management services segment continues its focus on obtaining new work with various u 
s government agencies  including the us military  both domestically and abroad 
our operating results decreased in due primarily to the substantial completion of several successful  large public works projects  and increased interest expense associated with our million senior unsecured notes  million term loan and borrowings under our revolving facility  offset by contributions from the recent acquisitions we have closed

potential impact of current economic conditions current economic and financial market conditions in the united states and overseas  including severe disruptions in the credit markets  have had an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if there is a prolonged economic recession or depression or if government efforts to stabilize and revitalize credit markets and financial institutions are not effective  current economic and financial market conditions could continue to adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 
the current instability in the financial markets has made it difficult for certain of our customers  including state and local governments  to access the credit markets to obtain financing or refinancing  as the case may be  to fund new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
state and local governments also are facing significant budget shortfalls as a result of declining tax and other revenues  which may cause them to defer or cancel planned infrastructure projects 
this situation has contributed to lower revenues in the past years 
we may encounter increased levels of deferrals and delays related to new construction projects in the future 
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets may increase the rate at which our customers defer  delay or cancel proposed new construction projects 
such deferrals  delays or cancellations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held by us as well as our proportionate share of amounts held by construction joint ventures 
cash held by us is available for general corporate purposes  while cash held by construction joint ventures is available only for joint venture related uses 
joint venture cash and cash equivalents are not restricted to specific uses within those entities  however  the terms of the joint venture agreements limit our ability to distribute those funds and use them for corporate purposes 
cash held by construction joint ventures is distributed from time to time to us and to the other joint venture participants in accordance with our respective percentage interest after the joint venture partners determine that a cash distribution is prudent 
cash distributions received by us from our construction joint ventures are then available for general corporate purposes 
at december  and december   cash held by us and available for general corporate purposes was million and million  respectively  our proportionate share of cash held by joint ventures and available only for joint venture related uses was million and million  respectively  and our restricted cash was million and million  respectively 
billing procedures in the construction industry generally are based on the specific billing terms of a contract 
for example  billings may be based on various measures of performance  such as cubic yards excavated  architect s estimates of completion  costs incurred on cost plus type contracts or weighted progress from a cost loaded construction time schedule 
billings are generally on a monthly basis and are reviewed and approved by the customer prior to submission 
therefore  once a bill is submitted  we are generally able to collect amounts owed to us in accordance with the payment terms of the contract 
in addition  receivables of a contractor usually include retentions  or amounts that are held back until contracts are completed or until specified contract conditions or guarantees are met 
retentions are governed by contract provisions and are typically a fixed percentage for example  or of each billing 
we generally follow the policy of paying our vendors and subcontractors after we receive payment from our customer

we received million in cash from financing activities  primarily due to our million term loan 
our cash balance decreased by million primarily due to the use of cash to fund our acquisition strategy during during  we generated million in cash from operating activities 
the cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to operating cash flow from our civil segment which more than offset operating cash uses from our building segment resulting from the timing of receivable collections on certain large projects  including receivables on the citycenter project 
we used million in cash to fund investing activities  including million to fund the acquisition of superior gunite  million to fund the deferred purchase price of certain acquisitions made in prior years  million to purchase construction equipment  and million for restricted cash to secure insurance related contingent obligations  such as insurance claim deductibles  in lieu of utilizing letters of credit

we received million in cash from financing activities  principally from a million note collateralized by transportation equipment owned by us and two notes totaling million to finance property acquisitions in guam 
our cash balance decreased by million during due to the use of cash in our operating and investing activities  which was primarily driven by an uncollected contract receivable related to the fontainebleau project  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and timing related billings due to the start up of new projects and the cash disbursements associated with projects completing during the year 
working capital increased  from million at the end of to million at december  the increase in working capital over the two year period primarily reflects working capital balances acquired from our recent acquisitions 
accordingly  the current ratio increased from x at december  to x at december  long term investments at december   we had investments in auction rate securities of million  which are reflected at fair value 
these investments are considered to be available for sale  and are classified as long term investments 
our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate many of our investments in auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  and million available under our available revolving facility as of december   we do not expect the short term lack of liquidity in the capital markets to affect our overall liquidity position or our ability to execute our current business plan 
for a description of our accounting for auction rate securities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

index we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities  the majority of which are rated aaa  that generally represent interests in pools of interest bearing student loans 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days 
in the event that such auctions are unsuccessful  the holder of the securities is not able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
an unsuccessful auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not signify a default by the issuer 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rates do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based upon a formula contained in the security  which rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
during the first quarter of  we made substantial additional investments in auction rate securities 
since mid february  regularly scheduled auctions for these securities started to fail throughout the market at a significant rate 
since that time  we have been successful in liquidating at par value a significant portion of our investment in auction rate securities 
during and  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in auction rate securities was in excess of its fair value and we recorded impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively  which were deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
during  we determined that the carrying value of our auction rate securities reflected fair value and therefore did not recognize any impairment charge 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships
