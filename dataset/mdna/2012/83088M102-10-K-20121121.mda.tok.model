the results of operations  assets and liabilities associated with the acquisition of advanced analogic technologies inc aati completed during the fiscal year ended september  have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date january  and are reflected in the balance sheet as of september  aati s contribution to our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  was insignificant 
the transaction costs associated 
table of contents with the aati acquisition are included within selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  results of operations fiscal years ended september   september   and october  the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal years below net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other charges credits total operating expenses operating income interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenue fiscal years ended september  change september  change october  dollars in thousands net revenue we market and sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers of communications and electronics products  third party original design manufacturers  contract manufacturers  and indirectly through electronic components distributors 
we periodically enter into revenue generating arrangements that leverage our broad intellectual property portfolio by licensing or selling our non core patents or other intellectual property 
we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 
overall revenue in fiscal year increased by million or 
the increase in revenue was primarily driven by sales of our expanded product portfolio consisting of new products from the sige and aati acquisitions 
in addition  we benefited from sales of new internally developed products for medical  automotive  military and industrial vertical markets and our increasing addressable content per device as the smartphone upgrade cycle continued to displace traditional g cellular phones 
overall revenue in fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year this revenue increase was principally driven by an increase in our growing addressable market  coupled with increasing market share and the higher overall demand for our products used in mobile internet  wireless infrastructure  energy management and diversified analog applications 
in addition  we benefited from the incremental revenue associated with the acquisition of sige during fiscal year for information regarding net revenue by geographic region and customer concentration  see note of item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents gross profit fiscal years ended september  change september  change october  dollars in thousands gross profit of net revenue gross profit represents net revenue less cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation and share based compensation expense associated with product manufacturing 
erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry 
consistent with trends in the industry  we anticipate that average selling prices for our established products will continue to decline at a normalized rate of to percent per year 
as part of our normal course of business  we mitigate the gross margin impact of declining average selling prices with efforts to increase unit volumes  reduce material costs and lower manufacturing costs of existing products and by introducing new and higher value added products 
gross profit was million greater for the fiscal year ended september  than gross profit for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit was the result of higher unit volumes and lower overall per unit material and manufacturing costs with an aggregate gross profit benefit of approximately million 
these benefits were offset by the erosion of average selling price  unfavorable changes in product mix  the impact of the fair value step up of acquired inventory primarily related to aati and sige and higher share based compensation expense which combined to negatively impact gross profit by approximately million 
as a result of these impacts  gross profit margin decreased from for the fiscal year ended september  to for the fiscal year ended september  we increased our gross profit by million for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior fiscal year  resulting in a basis point expansion in gross profit margin to 
this increase was principally the result of enhanced product mix  lower manufacturing costs as a result of higher factory utilization  and the increase in net revenue 
during fiscal and we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins associated with the licensing and or sale of intellectual property 
research and development fiscal years ended september  change september  change october  dollars in thousands research and development of net revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of direct personnel costs including share based compensation expense  costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices  masks  engineering prototypes and design tool costs 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is primarily attributable to higher head count and related compensation  including share based compensation expense  resulting from the acquisition of sige and aati  and to a lesser extent  to increased internal product design and development activity for our target markets 
this resulted in total research and development expense increasing as a percentage of net revenue 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is principally attributable to higher head count and related employee and share based compensation costs including those related to the sige acquisition 
in addition  we increased design activity and expense in support of increased product development for our target markets 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal year as a result of the increase in net revenue between fiscal and fiscal mentioned above 

table of contents selling  general and administrative fiscal years ended september  change september  change october  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative of net revenue selling  general and administrative expenses include legal and related legal costs  accounting  treasury  human resources  information systems  customer service  bad debt expense  sales commissions  share based compensation expense  advertising  marketing  costs associated with business combinations completed or contemplated during the period and other costs 
the increase for the fiscal year ended september  is primarily the result of incremental headcount and compensation expense including share based compensation related to the acquisitions of aati and sige full year impact  increased acquisition and legal expense of million primarily associated with the acquisition of aati and million in charges related to the resolution of contractual disputes 
these charges were partially offset by a million favorable change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with the acquisitions 
these factors resulted in selling  general and administrative expense increasing as a percentage of net revenue 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is principally due to the growth in the number of employees and related compensation expense including share based compensation  and to a lesser extent the increase related to professional fees associated with completed and pending acquisitions and a settlement of a contractual dispute 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to the increase in revenue between fiscal and fiscal mentioned above 
amortization of intangibles fiscal years ended september  change september  change october  dollars in thousands amortization of intangibles of net revenue the increase in amortization expense in fiscal year is primarily related to intangible assets recognized in connection with our acquisitions of aati in fiscal and the full year impact related to the acquisition of sige in fiscal the increase in amortization expense in fiscal year is primarily related to the intangible assets that were recognized in connection with the acquisition of sige in fiscal for additional information regarding the acquisitions and goodwill and intangible assets  see note and note of item of this annual report on form k  respectively 
restructuring and other charges credits fiscal years ended september  change september  change october  dollars in thousands restructuring and other charges credits of net revenue the increase in restructuring and other charges for fiscal year relate primarily to employee and lease terminations to reduce redundancies associated with the acquisition of aati 
the increase in restructuring and other charges for fiscal year relate primarily to employee and lease terminations to reduce redundancies associated with the acquisition of sige

provision for income taxes fiscal years ended september  change september  change october  dollars in thousands provision for income taxes of net revenue income tax expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal year the annual effective tax rate for fiscal year was as compared to a tax rate of for fiscal year the annual effective tax rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate of primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the united states federal rate  and benefits of related to a domestic production activities deduction partially offset by income tax expense of related to a change in our tax reserves 
as of september   the united states congress has not taken action to extend the federal tax credit available under the internal revenue code for research and development 
accordingly  the income tax provision for the year ended september  does not include the impact of such research and development tax credits earned after december  on october   we expanded our presence in asia by launching operations in singapore 
we operate under a tax holiday in singapore  which is effective through september  the tax holiday is conditional upon our compliance in meeting certain employment and investment thresholds in singapore 
the annual effective tax rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate of primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the united states federal rate  benefits of and related to the research and development tax credits and domestic production activities deduction  respectively  which are partially offset by income tax expense of related to a change in our tax reserves 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended dollars in thousands september  september  october  cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash and cash equivalents at end of period does not include restricted cash balances cash flow from operating activities cash provided from operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
for fiscal year we generated million in cash flow from operations  a decrease of million when compared to million generated in fiscal year the decrease in cash flow from operating activities during the fiscal year ended september  was related to lower net income combined with a net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase in non cash amortization of intangibles  depreciation and share based compensation expense 
specifically  the changes in operating assets were increases of million in accounts receivable due to the timing of customer shipments towards the end of the fiscal year triggered by a need to respond to key customer program ramp ups  an increase of million in inventory in response to key customer program ramp ups and million in other current assets primarily relating to taxes and pre paid assets 
the offsetting changes in operating liabilities were increases of approximately million in accounts payable related to the timing of vendor payments and million in other current and long term liabilities primarily related to long term tax liabilities and changes in payroll related accruals 

table of contents cash flow from investing activities cash flow from investing activities consists of cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  capital expenditures  cash received from the sale of capital assets and the sale and maturity of short term and other investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the fiscal year  compared to million during the fiscal year net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily because we used more cash to acquire businesses in than we did to acquire aati in  in each instance  net of cash acquired 
in fiscal year we used million of cash  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of aati and we invested million in capital expenditures  primarily related to the purchase of manufacturing equipment to support increased production at our assembly and test facility in mexicali  mexico and to a lesser extent  our wafer fabrication facilities located in california and massachusetts 
during fiscal year  we paid invested million in capital expenditures 
our uses of cash for investing activities during fiscal year were partially offset by million in proceeds we received upon the sale and maturity of short term investments acquired as part of our acquisition of aati during the fiscal year ending september  cash flow from financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash transactions related to debt  equity and payment of contingent consideration related to our fiscal acquisitions 
during fiscal year  we had net cash outflows of million  compared to million in fiscal year during fiscal year we had the following significant uses of cash million related to the cash payment of contingent consideration obligation related to the acquisition of sige  million in connection with the redemption and retirement of the remaining million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due march  million related to payroll tax withholdings on vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards  and  million related to our repurchase of approximately  shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on august  these uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of million and the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million during fiscal liquidity cash and cash equivalent balances excluding restricted cash which is used to collateralize outstanding letters of credit for insurance and lease obligations decreased by million to million at september  from million at september  during fiscal year we used million in cash  net of cash acquired  in connection with the acquisition of aati and paid cash of million in capital expenditures  million for contingent consideration obligations related to the acquisition of sige  million to retire the remaining million of aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due march  and million for share repurchases 
during fiscal our cash provided by operations was million 
our net cash position decreased by million to million at september  from million at september   after deducting our debt outstanding at september  based on our historical results of operations  we expect that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditures  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot be certain that our cash from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements 
in addition  any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make may require additional capital resources 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient cash or capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms  our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our invested cash balances primarily consist of money market funds where the underlying securities primarily consist of united states treasury obligations  united states agency obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by united states government and agency obligations 
our invested cash balances also include time deposits and certificates of deposit 
our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of million at september  consisted of million held domestically and million held by foreign subsidiaries 
of the cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash held by our foreign subsidiaries at september   approximately million is being and will be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated to the united states 
accordingly  we do not intend to repatriate these funds 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheet or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulation s k a ii

see notes of item of this annual report on form k contingent consideration related to business combinations is recorded at fair value and actual results could differ 
see note of item of this annual report on form k for further detail 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the policies of revenue recognition  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  business combinations  share based compensation  loss contingencies and income taxes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported  disclosures  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our best judgments 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note of item in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board s accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition net of estimated reserves 
we maintain revenue reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection and stock rotation for certain electronic component distributors 
these reserves are based on historical experience or specific identification of a contractual arrangement necessitating a revenue reserve 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the value of future credits to customers for product returns  price protection and stock rotation 
our estimates of the amount and timing of the reserves is based primarily on historical experience and specific contractual arrangements 
historically  we have not experienced material differences between our estimated sales reserves and actual results 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
our reserve is based on a detailed analysis of forecasted demand in relation to on hand inventory  saleability of our inventory  general market conditions  and product life cycles 
our inventory reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
historically  we have not experienced material 
table of contents differences between our estimated inventory reserves and actual results 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
pursuant to the guidance provided under asc segment reporting  we have determined that we have one reporting unit for the purposes of allocating and testing goodwill 
the impairment evaluation of goodwill involves comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we use the market price of the company s stock adjusted for a market premium to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure the possible goodwill impairment loss 
in the second step  if required  we would use a discounted cash flow methodology to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would then be compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  we would recognize a loss equal to the excess 
our impairment analyses contain uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to items such as  estimate control premiums  discount rate  future cash flows  the profitability of future business strategies and useful lives 
business combinations 
the company has applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed and the contingent consideration recorded as part of business combinations 
the value of all assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in measuring the fair value  the company utilizes valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach 
the valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions such as  projected revenue  royalty rates  weighted average cost of capital  discount rates  estimated useful lives  etc 
these assessments can be significantly affected by management s judgments 
share based compensation 
we have a share based compensation plan which includes non qualified stock options  share awards  employee stock purchase plan and other special share based awards 
see note of item of this annual report on form k for a detailed listing and complete discussion of our share based compensation programs 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified share based compensation at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant contains assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  risk free rate  and the expected life 
the black scholes value  combined with our estimated forfeiture rate  is used to determine the compensation expense to be recognized over the life of the options 
for performance based awards  we determine the fair value based on the grant date value of the company s stock 
these awards are expensed based on an estimate of the most probably outcome of the underlying performance metric 
management periodically evaluates these assumptions and updates share based compensation expense accordingly 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and stock based compensation recognized by the company 
loss contingencies 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainties 
estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a material loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
our loss contingency analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to assess the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of potential loss 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
asc income taxes asc  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with gaap 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this statement also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in the interim periods and disclosure 
the application of tax laws and regulations to calculate our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations  and court rulings 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
we record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we feel is more likely than not  based upon the technical merits of the position  to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that we feel are more likely than not to not be realized 
other matters inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the three year period ended september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to investment risk  interest rate risk  and foreign exchange rate risk as described below 
investment and interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate and general market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio consisted of the following in thousands as of september  cash and cash equivalents time deposits and money market funds restricted cash time deposits and certificates of deposit available for sale securities auction rate securities at carrying value the main objective of our investment activities is the liquidity and preservation of capital 
in general  our cash and cash equivalent investments have short term maturity periods which dampen the impact of significant market or interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with our investments is not material as our investment policy prescribes high credit quality standards and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading  speculative or investment purposes  however  we may use derivatives in the future 
we are subject to overall financial market risks  such as changes in market liquidity  credit quality and interest rates 
securities that are available for sale carry a longer maturity period in some cases original contractual maturities exceed ten years 
in the event the market conditions change in the future and our auction rate security becomes fully and permanently impaired  the impact to income before income taxes would be the par value of the auction rate security of approximately million as of september  based on the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september   a hypothetical reduction in interest rates to zero on our cash and cash equivalents would result in a reduction of interest income of approximately million to income before 
table of contents income taxes 
given the low interest rate environment  the objectives of our investment activities  and the relatively low interest income generated from our cash and cash equivalents and other investments  we do not believe that market  investment or interest rate risks pose material exposures to our current business or results of operations 
exchange rate risk substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results 
a small percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact those operating costs 
for the fiscal years ended september   september   and october   the company had foreign exchange losses gain of million  million  and million  respectively 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies
