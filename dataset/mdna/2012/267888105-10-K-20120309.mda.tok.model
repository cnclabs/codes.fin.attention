item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless stated otherwise  all dollar figures in this discussion are presented in thousands s 
executive overview our business is organized into three segments explosive metalworking which we also refer to as dmc clad  oilfield products and amk welding 
in  explosive metalworking accounted for of our net sales and of our income from operations before consideration of unallocated corporate expenses and stock based compensation expense  which is not allocated to our business segments 
our oilfield products and amk welding segments accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales  and and  respectively  of our income from operations before unallocated corporate expenses and stock based compensation expense 
in and  explosive metalworking accounted for and of our net sales  respectively  and and  respectively  of income from operations before unallocated corporate expenses and stock based compensation expense 
our net sales increased by  or  compared to net sales 
this year to year consolidated net sales increase reflects sales increases of  and  for our explosive metalworking and oilfield products segments  respectively  that were partially offset by a sales decrease of for our amk welding segment 
excluding incremental sales of  from the acquisition of austin explosives on june  and the step acquisition of two russian joint ventures that was completed on april   our oilfield products segment reported an increase of  or  from its net sales 
income from operations increased to  in from  in this  increase reflects increases of  and  in the operating income reported by our explosive metalworking and oilfield products segments  respectively  which were partially offset by a decrease in amk welding s operating income of and a net increase in aggregate unallocated corporate expenses and stock based compensation expense of reported consolidated operating income for and for includes amortization expense of  and  respectively  relating to purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisition of dynaenergetics  dynaenergetics canada  dynaenergetics us  and the russian joint ventures 
our net income increased by to  in from  in impact of current economic situation on the company 
we were only minimally impacted in by the global economic slowdown 
however  during and  we experienced a significant slowdown in explosive metalworking sales to some of the markets we serve 
the explosion welded clad plate market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a number of heavy industries  including oil and gas  alternative energy  chemicals and petrochemicals  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  and industrial refrigeration 
these industries tend to be cyclical in nature and the current worldwide economic downturn has affected many of these markets 
despite the slowdown we have seen in certain sectors  including chemical  petrochemical and hydrometallurgy  quoting activity in other end markets remains healthy  and we continue to track an extensive list of projects 
while timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict  our explosive metalworking segment has benefited from the modest improvement in of some of the industries it supplies and we believe that it is well positioned to further benefit as global economic conditions improve 
as a result of acquisitions made during and and strong organic sales growth beginning in the third quarter of  our oilfield products segment has grown into a second core business for us  generating of our consolidated net sales in as compared to only of our consolidated net sales in we believe the economic environment for this business segment remains positive and we expect to see continued organic sales growth in this segment during as well as the benefit of incremental sales from the january  acquisition of trx industries 
our explosive metalworking backlog  which totaled  at the end of before this business segment began to see a significant decline in booking activity  decreased to  at september  before rebounding to  at december  on strong fourth quarter booking activity and then decreasing to  at december  while the backlog at december  is substantially lower than that at the beginning of the year  our recent quoting activity has been very strong and  after a slow sales start in  we expect full year explosive metalworking net sales to be flat to up slightly from the  in net sales that this segment reported in based 
table of contents upon the december  explosive metalworking backlog  recent strong quoting activity for this segment and positive sales trends in our oilfield products business segment  we believe that our consolidated net sales could increase by to from the  in consolidated net sales that we reported in net sales explosive metalworking s revenues are generated principally from sales of clad metal plates and sales of transition joints  which are made from clad plates  to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries  including oil and gas  petrochemicals  alternative energy  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  industrial refrigeration  and similar industries 
while a large portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by new plant construction and large plant expansion projects  maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing  oil refining  and aluminum smelting facilities also account for a significant portion of total demand 
oilfield products revenues are generated principally from sales of shaped charges  detonators and detonating cord  and bidirectional boosters and perforating guns to customers who perform the perforation of oil and gas wells and from sales of seismic products to customers involved in oil and gas exploration activities 
amk welding s revenues are generated from welding  heat treatment  and inspection services that are provided with respect to customer supplied parts for customers primarily involved in the power generation industry and aircraft engine markets 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
we attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price 
gross profit and cost of products sold cost of products sold for explosive metalworking includes the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates  the cost of explosives  employee compensation and benefits  freight  outside processing costs  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
cost of products sold for oilfield products includes the cost of metals  explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges  detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s cost of products sold consists principally of employee compensation and benefits  welding supplies wire and gas  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  outside services and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to in from in income tax provisions on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are provided based upon the respective foreign statutory tax rates for the applicable years 
going forward  based upon existing tax regulations and current federal  state and foreign statutory tax rates  we expect our blended effective tax rate on our projected consolidated pre tax income to range between and in and subsequent years 

table of contents backlog we use backlog as a primary means of measuring the immediate outlook for our explosive metalworking business 
we define backlog at any given point in time as consisting of all firm  unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time 
generally speaking  we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following months 
from experience  most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized 
our backlog with respect to the explosive metalworking segment decreased to  at december  from  at december  based upon the december  explosive metalworking backlog  recent strong quoting activity for this segment and positive sales trends in our oilfield products business segment  we believe that our consolidated net sales could increase by to from the  in consolidated net sales that we reported in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales percentage change change net sales net sales for increased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
this  sales increase reflects a general strengthening of demand in our explosive metalworking business and more than million in second quarter export shipments from our us manufacturing facility on two large orders that were received in december of oilfield products contributed  to sales in of total sales compared to  in of total sales  which represents a sales increase of 
excluding incremental sales of  from our acquisition of austin explosives and the step acquisition of two russian joint ventures  oilfield products sales increased  or  reflecting a substantial increase in global oil and gas drilling activities  particularly in north america 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales  a decrease of 
this decrease includes a  decline in sales from ground power work that was partially offset by an increase in sales from aircraft engine work 
gross profit percentage change change gross profit consolidated gross profit margin rate gross profit increased by to  in from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate increased to from in the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking increased from in to in oilfield products gross margin remained flat at in both and the gross profit margin for amk welding decreased to in from in the increase in the gross profit margin rate for explosive metalworking reflects an increase in our us gross margin rate from in to in and a increase in our european gross margin rate from in to in on year to year sales increases of and  respectively 
the increase in the gross profit margin rate for our explosive metalworking segment relates principally to favorable changes in product mix as compared to but also reflects a somewhat improved pricing environment compared to the extremely competitive pricing environment that existed throughout and a more favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
as has been the case historically  we expect to see continued fluctuations in explosive metalworking s quarterly gross margin rates in the future that result from fluctuations in quarterly sales volume and changes in product mix 

table of contents the oilfield products gross margin rate of in was the same as that reported in the absence of change in the oilfield products gross margin rate reflects favorable cost variances resulting from increased production levels that were totally offset by unfavorable changes in product customer mix 
the decrease in amk welding s reported gross margin relates principally to differences in the rate at which amk welding absorbed its fixed manufacturing overhead costs based on the sales decrease discussed above 
based upon the expected contribution to consolidated net sales by each of our three business segments  we expect our consolidated full year gross margin to be in a range of to 
general and administrative expenses percentage change change general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in excluding incremental general and administrative expenses of that resulted from the acquisition of austin explosives and the russian joint ventures  our general and administrative expenses increased by  or 
this increase includes increases of and in salaries and incentive compensation  respectively  an increase in legal fees of  an increase in consulting fees of relating to information technology projects  an increase of in other outside professional service fees  a increase in business development expenses  an increase of in certain corporate governance and public company expenses board of director fees  directors and officers insurance and other investor relations expenses  and a net increase of in all other expense categories

this increase in our selling and distribution expenses includes increased selling and distribution expenses of  at our us divisions and at our foreign divisions 
the  increase in our us selling and distribution expenses reflects increases of and for salaries and accrued incentive compensation  respectively  an increase of for sales commissions and a net increase of in all other spending categories 
the increase in our foreign divisions selling and distribution expenses reflects increases of and for salary expense and sales commissions  respectively  and a net increase of in all other spending categories 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and distribution expenses remained relatively flat at in compared to in our consolidated selling and distribution expenses include  and  for our explosive metalworking and oilfield products business segments  respectively 
our consolidated selling and distribution expenses include  and  for our explosive metalworking and oilfield products business segments  respectively 
the higher level of selling and distribution expenses for our oilfield products segment relative to its contribution to our consolidated net sales reflects the need  particularly in north america  to maintain a number of strategically located distribution centers that are in close proximity to areas which contain a large concentration of oilfields and enjoy a high volume of related oil and gas drilling activities

oilfield products reported operating income of  in as compared to operating income of  in the significant improvement in operating results for our oilfield products segment is attributable to the significant increases in sales and gross profit as discussed above that reflect the incremental sales and gross profit from the acquisitions of austin explosives and the russian joint ventures as well as an increase in global oil and gas drilling activities  particularly in north america 
operating results of oilfield products for and include  and  respectively  of amortization expense of purchased intangible assets 
amk welding reported operating income of  in  a decrease of from the  in operating income that it reported in the decline in amk s operating income is largely attributable to the declines in sales and gross margin rate as discussed above

this euro term loan was scheduled to mature on november  our interest expense includes a non recurring  non cash charge of related to the write off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the our bank syndicate credit facility entered into on november   which was amended and restated in its entirety on december  through a new five year credit facility with a syndicate of four banks 
the decrease in our interest expense is attributable to a significant reduction in average outstanding borrowings that resulted principally from  in payments on syndicated term loans during  including the march prepayment of the euro term loan discussed above 
income tax provision percentage change change income tax provision effective tax rate we recorded an income tax provision of  in compared to  in the effective tax rate increased to a more normal level of from in our unusually low effective tax rate related principally to the low tax rate applicable to the non recurring gain on the acquisition of non controlling interests in two russian joint ventures

our aggregate non cash depreciation  amortization of purchased intangible assets and stock based compensation expense for and was  and  respectively 
these aggregate non cash charges represent a significant percentage of the consolidated operating income that we reported for these periods 
we use non gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda in our operational and financial decision making and believe that these non gaap measures are a reliable indicator of our ability to generate cash flow from operations and facilitate a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of our three business segments than do certain gaap measures 
research analysts  investment bankers and lenders also use ebitda and adjusted ebitda to assess operating performance 
the following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebidta 
net income attributable to dmc interest expense interest income provision for income taxes depreciation amortization of purchased intangible assets ebitda stock based compensation other income expense  net equity in earnings of joint ventures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda increased to  in from  in primarily due to the  increase in operating income

while lower sales and the resultant less favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs have negatively impacted gross margins reported by all of our cladding divisions  the significant decline in our us gross margin rate for compared to relates principally to unfavorable changes in product mix and an extremely competitive pricing environment in certain end markets that comprise a significant portion of our sales 
historically  gross margins for our european explosion welding divisions have been lower than those reported by our us division due to less efficient fixed manufacturing cost structures associated with our smaller european facilities and this has again been case during while our european cladding divisions also face a competitive pricing environment  the principal reason for the large decrease in our european gross margin rate for compared to is the decline in sales 
as has been the case historically  we expect to see continued fluctuations in explosive metalworking s quarterly gross margin rates in the future that result from fluctuations in quarterly sales volume and change in product mix 
the increase in oilfield products gross margin relates principally to the significant sales increases that are discussed above and favorable changes in product customer mix 
gross margins reported by the oilfield products segment also reflect the incremental margin on intercompany sales to recently acquired former distributors in canada  the us and russia as these acquired entities sell products through to the end customers

critical accounting policies our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
existing rules must be interpreted and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are revenue recognition  asset impairments  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income taxes 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  and actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of clad metal products and welding services are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used  services performed and the results of any non destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed 
all issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed 
products related to the oilfield products segment  which include detonating cords  detonators  bi directional boosters and shaped charges  as well as  seismic related explosives and accessories  are standard in nature 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a probable loss  we will account for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments we review our long lived assets to be held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
business combinations we account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple  highly subjective variables  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates  asset lives  and the use of different valuation models and therefore require considerable judgment 
our estimates and assumptions are based  in part  on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data 
these determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in 
table of contents circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances  many of which are subjective in nature  include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy  a significant decrease in the market value of the asset  and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset 
if an impairment indicator is present  we perform an analysis to confirm whether an impairment has actually occurred and if so  the amount of the required impairment charge 
we assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an identifiable intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment and assumptions  including assumptions regarding estimated useful lives  revenue growth  operating margins  future market conditions and discount rates 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level on at least an annual basis 
a reporting unit is a group of businesses i for which discrete financial information is available and ii that have similar economic characteristics 
we test goodwill for impairment first by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and then comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if carrying value exceeds fair value for any reporting unit  then we calculate and compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill and record an impairment charge for any excess of carrying value over implied fair value 
our impairment testing has not resulted in a determination that any of our goodwill was impaired 
a future impairment is possible and could occur if i operating results underperform what we have estimated or ii additional volatility of the capital markets or other factors should cause us to raise the percent discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis or decrease the multiples utilized in our market based analysis 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using methodologies other than as described above could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge 
finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators are present 
we compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with these finite lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if they are fully recoverable 
if the expected future operating cash flows of an asset are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  we estimate the fair value of the asset 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when the carrying value exceeds fair value 
the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to  among other things  relevant market factors  revenue growth  if any  and operating margins 
income taxes we are required to recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in our financial statements but not our tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on income tax credits and on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine if they will  more likely than not  be recovered from future projected taxable income  if not  we record an appropriate valuation allowance 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those appearing or disclosed in our financial statements forming part of this annual report  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
forward looking statements this annual report and the documents incorporated by reference into it contain certain forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigations reform act of these statements include information with respect to our anticipated future financial condition and results of operations and businesses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates 
periodically  we use interest rate swaps to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of our assets and liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rate risk management 
foreign currency risk our consolidated financial statements are expressed in us dollars  but a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
changes in the exchange rates for such currencies into us dollars can affect our revenues  earnings  and the carrying value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  either positively or negatively 
sales made in currencies other than us dollars accounted for   and of total sales for the years ended   and  respectively
