table of contents part i item business overview we are a development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of acute and breakthrough pain 
we were founded to solve the problems associated with post operative intravenous patient controlled analgesia  or iv pca 
although widely used  iv pca has been shown to cause harm to patients following surgery because of the side effects of morphine  the invasive iv route of delivery and the inherent potential for programming and delivery errors associated with the complexity of infusion pumps 
in march  we initiated the first of three phase clinical trials for our lead product candidate  the sufentanil nanotab pca system  or arx system  or arx the remaining two phase studies are expected to start by the third quarter of the three planned phase clinical trials include two double blind  placebo controlled efficacy and safety trials and one active comparator study 
the arx system is designed to address the problems of iv pca by utilizing sufentanil  a high therapeutic index opioid  nanotabs  our proprietary  non invasive sublingual dosage form  and our novel pre programmed handheld pca device that enables simple patient controlled delivery of nanotabs in the hospital setting and eliminates the risk of programming errors 
we have completed phase clinical development for two additional product candidates  the sufentanil nanotab btp management system  or arx  for the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain  or btp  and the sufentanil triazolam nanotab  or arx  designed to provide mild sedation  anxiety reduction and pain relief for patients undergoing painful procedures in a physician s office 
in addition  in may  we announced that the us army medical research and material command  or usamrmc  awarded us a million grant to support the development of a new product candidate  the sufentanil single dose nanotab for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain  or arx under the terms of the grant  the usamrmc will reimburse us for development  manufacturing and clinical expenses necessary to prepare for and complete the planned phase dose finding trial in a study of moderate to severe acute pain  and to prepare to enter phase development 
we were originally incorporated as surx  inc in delaware on july  we subsequently changed our name to acelrx pharmaceuticals  inc on august  sufentanil nanotabs sufentanil  a high therapeutic index opioid  which has no active metabolites  is to times more potent than fentanyl and is used intravenously as a primary anesthetic to produce balanced general anesthesia for surgery  and for epidural administration during labor and delivery 
sufentanil has many pharmacological advantages over other opioids 
published studies demonstrate that sufentanil produces significantly less respiratory depressive effects relative to its analgesic effects compared to other opioids  including morphine  alfentanil and fentanyl 
these third party clinical results correlate well with preclinical studies demonstrating sufentanil s high therapeutic index  or the ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic dose of a drug  used as a measure of the relative safety of the drug for a particular treatment 
accordingly  we believe that despite its potency  sufentanil can be developed to provide an effective and relatively safe solution for the treatment of acute and breakthrough pain 
the following table illustrates the difference between the therapeutic index of different opioids 
opioid therapeutic index meperidine methadone morphine hydromorphone fentanyl sufentanil 
table of contents although the analgesic efficacy of sufentanil has been well established  its use has been limited due to its short duration of action when delivered intravenously 
the pharmaceutical attributes of sufentanil  including lipid solubility and ionization  result in rapid cell membrane penetration and onset of action  which we believe make sufentanil an optimal opioid for the treatment of both acute pain and breakthrough pain 
in addition  its pharmacokinetic  or pk  profile when delivered sublingually avoids the high peak plasma levels and short duration of action of iv administration 
sublingual delivery of sufentanil summary of phase clinical studies results we have completed four phase pk studies with our proprietary sublingual sufentanil nanotabs to support our four product candidates under development 
these studies demonstrated desirable and consistent pk parameters  including relatively high bioavailability via the oral mucosa and very low gastrointestinal  or gi  bioavailability  prolonged plasma levels relative to iv delivery  pk parameters proportional to dose across a wide range of doses mcg to mcg  lower peak plasma concentration  or c 
max  than iv delivery  time to maximum plasma concentrations  or t 
max  range from to minutes  relatively low patient to patient variability in t 
max 
and c 
max  and repeat dosing pk that supports a minute minimum re dosing interval 
the chart below illustrates the pk profile of sublingual sufentanil nanotab compared to iv delivery of sufentanil from one of our completed phase pk studies 
logo we have demonstrated that sublingual delivery of sufentanil avoids the high peak plasma levels and short duration of action of iv administration  enabling potential for broader use 
our proprietary nanotab dosage form is a very small disc shaped tablet with a bioadhesive excipient  or inactive ingredient  that enables the nanotab to adhere to mucosal tissues 
this allows sublingual delivery of sufentanil from the nanotab by adherence to the 
table of contents sublingual mucosa  or tissues under the tongue 
the nanotab adheres within seconds after administration and full disintegration occurs within minutes 
the small size of the nanotab  pictured below  is designed to minimize the saliva response and amount of sufentanil swallowed  resulting in high oral transmucosal uptake  whereby a majority of the drug is absorbed via the oral tissues directly into the bloodstream  and consistent pharmacokinetics 
our portfolio of product candidates leverages the inherent advantages of sufentanil that are underutilized in medical practice 
we believe our non invasive  proprietary nanotab sublingual dosage form overcomes the limitations of the current treatment options available for both acute and breakthrough pain

the market opportunity for arx the post operative pain market in the united states  europe and japan is growing steadily and is expected to reach billion by despite its size  this market remains underserved 
studies report that up to of patients experience inadequate pain relief after surgery 
inadequate pain relief can lead to decreased mobility  which increases the risks of other medical complications  including deep vein thrombosis and partial lung collapse  and can result in extended hospital stays 
the decision resources acute pain report projects that in  million in patient procedures performed in the united states  europe and japan will require post operative treatment of pain  growing at a rate of approximately per annum 
market research among surgeons and anesthesiologists has identified a consistent positive response to the attributes of arx and indicates an interest in using arx in of their eligible patients 
additionally  physicians expressed interest in using arx for patients who stay in the hospital for less than hours and are not traditionally treated with iv pca 
pharmacy and therapeutics committees also indicate strong interest in arx  with of those interviewed indicating likely adoption to formulary 
how arx addresses the unmet medical need in post operative pain management there are many deficiencies associated with the current use of iv pca  including side effects associated with the most commonly used opioid  morphine  and its active metabolites  infection risk  analgesic gaps and decreased mobility associated with the invasive nature of iv delivery  and medication errors  which in some instances may be fatal  due to the complexity of iv pca pumps  many of which arise from programming errors 
according to published literature  the estimated annual error rate is errors per  people treated with iv pca in the united states 
published analysis of medmarx from to reveals that iv pca errors represent a four fold higher relative risk of harm compared to all other medication errors 
the most recent published analysis of the fda maude database reports that of iv pca operator errors reported during a two year index period  from to  resulted in patient deaths 
approximately  adverse events were reported to the fda between and  prompting class ii infusion pump recalls of devices that could cause temporary or reversible adverse effects and class i infusion pump recalls of devices that could cause serious injury or death 
these issues with infusion pumps have resulted in the issuance of new draft guidance by the fda  significantly increasing the data required to be submitted by manufacturers to address safety problems 
arx has the potential to address many of the key disadvantages of iv pca  including reducing the incidence of drug related side effects  eliminating the risk of iv pca related infections  reducing analgesic gaps and enhancing mobility  and eliminating the risk of programming errors 

table of contents we believe that arx will provide a favorable safety  efficacy and tolerability profile  enabling arx to become the new standard of care for pca 
further  we believe use of arx will result in increased patient satisfaction and reduced overall healthcare costs 
arx description arx allows patients to self administer sublingual sufentanil nanotabs as needed to manage their post operative pain in the hospital setting  and provides the record keeping attributes of a conventional iv pca pump while avoiding some of the key issues  such as programming errors  associated with conventional iv pca use 
our sufentanil nanotab pca system  arx  consists of three components sufentanil  a high therapeutic index opioid  nanotabs  our proprietary  non invasive sublingual dosage form  and our novel  pre programmed  handheld pca device that enables simple patient controlled delivery of nanotabs in the hospital setting and eliminates the risk of programming errors 
arx utilizes sufentanil  which has one of the highest therapeutic indices of all commercially available opioids  making it an attractive candidate for the management of post operative pain 
formulated in our proprietary sublingual nanotab dosage form  sufentanil provides for relatively high bioavailability  with lower peak drug levels and a longer duration of action compared to iv delivery 
our handheld pca device consists of a stack of sufentanil mcg nanotabs approximately a two day supply in a disposable radio frequency identification and bar coded cartridge see figure  a disposable dispenser tip see figure  and a reusable  rechargeable handheld controller see figure 
figure  cartridge with nanotab tablets figure  dispenser tip figure  controller logo logo logo this product candidate has not been approved by the fda 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates 
our novel handheld pca device has the following safety features a wireless system access key for the healthcare professional  a wireless  electronic  adhesive thumb tag that acts as a single patient identification key  pre programmed minute lock out to avoid overdosing  a security tether that is designed to prevent theft and misuse  and fully automated inventory record of nanotabs usage 

table of contents to set up the handheld pca device  the nurse or healthcare professional turns on the controller and follows the simple step by step instructions described below retrieve the nanotab cartridge from secure drug storage  lock the cartridge and dispenser into the controller  and set up the secure patient access system  which is comprised of a security tether and a wireless  electronic  adhesive thumb tag that acts as a single patient identification key 
to use arx  the patient would confirm that the green indicator light is illuminated  meaning the device is available to dose  place dispenser tip under tongue and push the large button on the controller  which dispenses a single nanotab  remove the device from mouth upon hearing a tone confirming delivery of the nanotab  and see the blue indicator light illuminate  indicating no new dose can be dispensed for the next minutes 
during our phase clinical study evaluating device functionality  of patients reported that they could handle the arx system easily and that user instructions were clear 
sufentanil nanotab pca system arx clinical program summary we recently initiated the first of three phase clinical trials that we expect to conduct in additionally  we expect to have top line data from all three of these in late or early prior to this  we completed three successful phase clinical trials of sufentanil nanotabs in the post operative setting 
these studies demonstrated analgesic efficacy  a low adverse event profile and excellent device functionality 
during our end of phase meeting with the fda  the fda stated that the demonstration of efficacy versus placebo in two phase studies with a total safety database of at least patients exposed to the active drug should suffice to support a new drug application  or nda 
we have designed our phase trials based on the feedback from the fda 
planned phase clinical trials for arx we plan to conduct three phase trials in for arx two double blind  placebo controlled efficacy and safety trials and one phase open label active comparator study that will provide both incremental safety and marketing data 
in march  we initiated our first phase efficacy and safety clinical study with arx in a double blind  placebo controlled trial for a minimum of hours and up to hours in adult patients undergoing open abdominal surgery 
the objective is to compare the efficacy of arx to placebo for the management of acute post operative pain 
approximately patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with sufentanil or placebo 
the primary endpoint will be the summed pain intensity difference over the first hours of the study period  or spid we expect to receive top line data from this study in the second half of key secondary endpoints include a modified spid  in which a series of different imputation strategies for the use of rescue opioids are analyzed  pain relief scores and total amount of rescue opioids utilized 
our second phase study will be an open label active comparator study of arx versus the current standard of care  morphine iv pca  in patients undergoing orthopedic or abdominal surgery 
approximately patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with our sufentanil nanotab pca system or morphine iv pca 
the primary endpoint will be the demonstration of statistical non inferiority between the two groups for global patient satisfaction over the course of the study by patient reporting on a point rating scale of poor  fair  good and excellent 
important secondary endpoints for comparison to iv pca morphine will be drop out due to 
table of contents inadequate analgesia  level of sedation  ease of care for patients and nurses  reporting of analgesic gaps and interdosing intervals 
we expect to initiate the active comparator study in the second quarter of with top line data expected in the second half of our third phase efficacy and safety clinical study will be a double blind  placebo controlled trial in patients who are undergoing a total hip or knee replacement under general or spinal anesthesia 
the objective is to compare the efficacy of the sufentanil nanotab pca system to placebo for the management of acute post operative pain 
approximately patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with sufentanil or placebo 
the primary endpoint will be the spid we expect this study to start in the third quarter of with top line data expected in late or early the planned initiation of our third planned phase clinical study is contingent upon the completion of a summative human factors study  as required by the fda 
in this study  nurses and patients will be asked to perform tasks to demonstrate that the sufentanil nanotab pca system can be reliably used under a range of simulated use conditions to validate the usability of the arx system and the effectiveness of the instructions for use 
the arx phase device is an upgraded version of the phase device  with enhanced features  including a color graphical user interface screen  security features to allow only the patient to use the device and prevent unauthorized access to the drug  and improved industrial design for hospital use 
phase clinical results for arx we completed three phase studies in support of sufentanil nanotabs 
across all studies  the average time interval between doses was approximately minutes 
this compares favorably to typical redosing intervals for iv pca with average period between dosing of to minutes 
no serious adverse events  or saes  were reported that were considered to be related to the study drug 
adverse events  or aes  that were reported were similar to those reported for placebo treated patients 
these results demonstrate that sufentanil nanotabs are effective and well tolerated by patients undergoing both major orthopedic and abdominal surgical procedures 
phase clinical results in unilateral knee replacement arx c in the first phase study  we conducted a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multicenter phase clinical study to evaluate the efficacy  safety and tolerability of sublingual sufentanil nanotabs in patients undergoing elective unilateral knee replacement 
the study enrolled male and female patients to years of age who were undergoing elective knee replacement surgery 
this procedure was chosen as it represents one of the most painful procedures patients undergo in the hospital setting 
patients were randomly assigned to treatment with sufentanil nanotab mcg  mcg  mcg  or placebo 
sufentanil nanotabs were administered by study staff at the request of the patient with at least minutes between doses 
the primary endpoint was the sum of the pain intensity difference at each evaluation time point compared to baseline over the hour study duration  or spid the study results demonstrated that sufentanil nanotab mcg was effective  safe and well tolerated for the treatment of acute post operative pain in patients who had undergone unilateral knee replacement 
the sufentanil nanotab mcg spid was higher than placebo p using the last observation carried forward  or locf  imputation method 
a p value is a probability with a value ranging from to  which indicates the likelihood that a clinical study is different between treatment and control groups 
p values below are typically referred to as statistically significant 
the sufentanil nanotab mcg or mcg dosage strengths did not achieve a statistically significant separation from placebo overall 
however  the mcg dose was statistically significant as compared with placebo for women p 
throughout the study there were statistically significant differences in spid scores between the sufentanil nanotab mcg dose group and the placebo group  even at the earliest time point of minutes p 
there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory variables  vital signs or oxygen saturation during the study 
the five saes reported were all considered unrelated to study drug and occurred after the end of study drug dosing 

table of contents the following figure shows the summed pain intensity difference over the hour study period for the placebo  mcg  mcg and mcg groups 
logo intent to treat population the intent to treat  or itt  population includes all randomized patients regardless of whether they received or adhered to the allocated treatment group 
itt analysis provides unbiased comparisons among the treatment groups and is the primary statistical analysis used by the fda 

table of contents phase clinical results in major abdominal surgery arx c our second phase study tested sufentanil nanotabs mcg  mcg or placebo in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery 
in all other respects this study was similar in design to our first study 
both dosage strengths were significantly more effective than placebo for spid p as well as for all measures of pain intensity and pain relief 
significant differences between the sufentanil nanotab treatment groups and the placebo group were observed within hours after the first dose of study drug and continued until the end of the hour treatment period 
there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory variables  vital signs or oxygen saturation during the study 
there were no saes reported during the study drug treatment period 
the following figure shows the spid for the placebo  mcg and mcg groups 
logo phase clinical results in open label device functionality study in unilateral knee replacement arx c we conducted an open label functionality  safety and efficacy study of the arx nanotab delivery system in patients undergoing elective unilateral knee replacement surgery 
the study was a prospective  open label  multicenter trial in male and female patients to years of age with an average age of all patients were treated with sufentanil nanotab mcg dosage strength 
the primary endpoint was the percent of patients who completed the study without any sufentanil nanotab pca system failures 
the study also collected patient feedback on the design characteristics of the pca system 
patients self administered sufentanil nanotabs repeatedly over the hour study using the arx sufentanil nanotab pca system without any system failures or dosing errors for all patients 
over of the patients reported the two highest scores on the point likert scale of overall patient s satisfaction with the sufentanil nanotab pca system mcg 
all enrolled patients indicated that they could handle the sufentanil nanotab pca system easily  that the user instructions were clear  that the dosing tone was loud enough and that the time required for dosing was just right 
ninety percent of the patients indicated that the size and the shape of the dosing tip were also just right 
the majority of patients indicated that the other system features weight  size  shape  dose button function were acceptable 
the mean pain intensity scores decreased from at baseline to the lowest score of at hours

there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory variables or vital signs and no saes reported during the study drug treatment period 

table of contents summary of phase adverse events overall the ae profile for the three phase studies suggests that arx is well tolerated compared to typical ae rates seen with post operative opioids 
published data indicates a much higher rate of somnolence approximately and oxygen desaturation approximately during standard iv pca use compared to results obtained in our phase studies 
the high therapeutic index of sufentanil  in animal studies suggests that opioid induced sedation and oxygen desaturation does not occur with sufentanil until doses much higher than required for analgesia are administered 
we believe our phase ae data confirm the high safety index of sufentanil

the market opportunity for arx according to published data  in more than  cancer patients in the united states experienced breakthrough pain 
we estimate the prescription volume for oral transmucosal products for the management of cancer breakthrough pain to be  prescriptions per year 
this suggests that less than of cancer patients with cancer breakthrough pain are treated with approved transmucosal breakthrough pain medications 
in addition  many physicians use immediate release oral opioids to treat cancer breakthrough pain 
we believe that this market is significantly larger than the transmucosal product market 
market research among physicians managing cancer patients indicates that arx could capture approximately a quarter of the cancer breakthrough pain prescriptions 
in this research  arx was predicted to take share equally from both the immediate release oral products and the transmucosal products 
given the positive reaction to the product profile and the potential benefits of arx compared to currently available products  we believe that arx represents a significant commercial opportunity 
how arx addresses the unmet medical need in cancer breakthrough pain all products approved for the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain available today are fentanyl based and have a number of limitations  including elimination half lives of to hours to treat a cancer breakthrough pain event that typically lasts to minutes  
table of contents inconsistent t 
max 
that ranges from to minutes  and can result in erratic onset of action and the potential for dose stacking  local adverse events  such as dental caries and oral mucosal irritation  and drug packaging that lacks effective deterrence against abuse and misuse 
we designed arx to address these problems by providing sufentanil  a shorter duration of action opioid with an elimination half life ranging from to hours  which more closely matches the duration of a cancer breakthrough pain event  utilizing sufentanil  which provides for a consistent t 
max 
with a narrow range of to minutes  thereby reducing the risk of dose stacking  avoiding irritation of the oral mucosa  as demonstrated in our clinical studies  and packaging technology that enhances patient safety by reducing the possibility of misuse or abuse  while providing healthcare professionals with usage data 
in addition  continual use of any given opioid by a patient creates a risk of tolerance specific to that molecule  reducing the effectiveness of the drug 
we believe the availability of arx  as a non fentanyl based product  will allow physicians to rotate opioids prescribed for cancer breakthrough pain  thereby maintaining the effectiveness of treatment 
arx description arx is a product candidate for the treatment of cancer patients who suffer from breakthrough pain 
arx consists of a magazine containing single dose applicators  or sdas  loaded into a multiple sda dispenser  or msd 
each sda includes a sufentanil nanotab that a patient can self administer to his or her sublingual space for oral transmucosal absorption 
the msd protects and dispenses sdas  one at a time  displays a recent dose indicator that is designed to mitigate overdosing  has child resistant  elderly friendly features  and provides electronic date and time stamping of each sda removal event 
the date and time event log is designed to be retrieved from the msd by a healthcare professional during an office visit to assist the prescriber in understanding the usage profile of the medication  including diversion or abuse 
overall  our goal is to improve the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain while adding a substantially heightened level of detection and deterrence around prescription opioid use  misuse and abuse 
while the initial dispenser for outpatient use is designed for dispensing sufentanil nanotabs for cancer breakthrough pain events  we believe this concept could be adapted into developing dispensers for other scheduled drugs in the future 
sufentanil nanotab btp management system arx clinical program summary we held an end of phase meeting with the fda in july the fda stated that the demonstration of efficacy versus placebo in a single phase study with a total safety database of to patients exposed to active drug  with at least patients treated for a minimum of three months  may support an indication for the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain with underlying chronic pain 
planned phase clinical trials for arx future development of arx is contingent upon additional funding or corporate partnership resources 
should such funds or resources become available  we could proceed with the planned trials and future development described below 

table of contents we would plan to conduct one phase efficacy and safety study for arx for the management of cancer breakthrough pain in adult patients who are already taking opioids for their underlying persistent cancer pain 
in addition  we would plan to conduct two open label studies to demonstrate long term safety  which will include the use of the msd 
the first planned phase clinical study for arx is a multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled crossover study for the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the sufentanil nanotab btp management system in the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain 
we plan to screen patients in order to titrate approximately patients  of which patients will be randomized  such that at least patients will generate primary efficacy data for analysis 
the planned study consists of a screening visit  an open label titration phase of up to three weeks to establish a dose of sufentanil     or mcg at home or in a hospice setting  that provides adequate relief of cancer breakthrough pain with tolerable side effects 
this will be followed by a randomized  double blind treatment phase of up to three weeks 
patients will be randomized to one of six sequences  each including nine doses of which six are active and three are placebo 
patients will use an electronic diary to record primary and secondary efficacy outcomes including pain intensity  pain relief  and global evaluation of treatment 
the primary endpoint is the time weighted summed pain intensity difference over minutes  or spid  following treatment 
patients who complete our phase efficacy trial will be allowed to participate in an open label extension study to continue evaluating the safety of arx for up to one year 
during each month while participating in the study  patients will present to the clinical site for visits to assess their medical status and proper use of study medication 
the primary objective is to determine the long term safety of sufentanil nanotabs in patients with cancer breakthrough pain 
the dispensing device that was used in the phase study for arx was a simple  mechanical single dose applicator  or sda  designed for a single use 
the design for phase device contains both mechanical and electronic components and is intended to be a multiple use device with a magazine containing smaller sdas than those used in phase the magazine is loaded into a multiple sda dispenser  or msd  which will include software to electronically track removal of each sda from the msd 
several industrial models have been developed that depict the size and form factor of the smaller sda and the msd 
we also plan to conduct an additional open label study to ensure there is adequate data for analysis of drug safety and device functionality 
we plan to screen approximately patients in order to titrate approximately patients  such that at least patients will enroll in this study 
patients will use the msd that will contain a magazine holding sdas 
each sda will contain a single sufentanil nanotab 
the msd will electronically track removal of each sda from the msd in order to record dosing history in the outpatient setting 
this study will be up to three months in duration and will utilize the same titration scheme as in the phase efficacy study 
after patients achieve an efficacious and tolerable dose  they will use the msds to dispense the sdas throughout the three month study 
phase clinical results for arx we have completed a phase study of the analgesic efficacy of the sufentanil nanotab in adult cancer patients who are opioid tolerant and suffering from breakthrough pain events 
this study was a prospective  multicenter  randomized  placebo controlled multicenter  crossover study for the evaluation of the safety  efficacy and tolerability of the sufentanil nanotab btp management system in the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain 
patients were screened and  if qualified for the study  would titrate to an effective dose of sufentanil that provided adequate relief of cancer breakthrough pain without producing intolerable side effects 
patients self administered a single sufentanil nanotab using a single dose applicator  starting with a mcg dose  followed by titration with   and mcg sufentanil nanotabs 
the primary objective during the titration phase was to assess the safety and efficacy of arx the primary endpoint during the randomized  double blind phase was to assess the efficacy of arx compared to placebo in the management of cancer breakthrough pain as determined by spid 
table of contents once a dosage strength that alleviated pain without producing intolerable side effects was identified  the patient was randomized to that dosage strength in the double blind phase of the study 
patients were randomized to receive doses  of which seven were active and three were placebo 
efficacy was assessed by patient data recorded and scored in an electronic diary  including pain intensity  pain relief and global medication performance assessment just prior to and after taking each of the ten doses of study drug in the double blind phase of the study 
forty two patients were enrolled and received titration study medication 
eighty four percent of patients with a mean age of years range to years were randomized to the double blind treatment period 
thirty three patients completed the study 
the primary endpoint of time weighted spid for sufentanil nanotab treated episodes was greater than placebo treated episodes p as shown in the figure below 
logo modified intent to treat population the modified intent to treat population is a subset of the itt population and included all randomized patients who took at least one active dose and one placebo dose  and had pre treatment and at least one post treatment pain intensity score for each of these episodes 
pain intensity and pain relief were included as secondary endpoints 
lower scores for pain intensity were reported at each evaluation time point for sufentanil treated episodes compared to placebo treated episodes p at minutes and p at all other time points 
time reported time weighted total pain relief  or totpar  was greater at all time points for sufentanil treated episodes compared to placebo treated episodes p and p for the and minute time points  respectively  and p for the remaining time points 
patient global medication performance assessment  or gmpa  at minutes after each dose of study medication showed and of the sufentanil treated episodes were rated as very good or excellent on the gmpa  respectively  compared with seven and nine  respectively  in the placebo treated episodes 
there was a statistically significant difference for gmpa measurements between the sufentanil treated episodes and the placebo treated episodes p 
three patients reported an sae  however  all saes were considered unrelated to study drug 
the most common aes during the titration period were nervous system disorders  general disorders  and gastrointestinal disorders 
the most common nervous system disorder was dysgeusia  or altered sense of taste four patients  
the most common gastrointestinal disorder was dry mouth three patients  
the most common aes during the 
table of contents double blind period were nervous system disorders  general disorders  and gastrointestinal disorders 
the most common nervous system disorder was headache two patients

the market opportunity for arx each year in the united states  more than million procedures take place in a physician s office that are known to be anxiety inducing and painful 
these procedures include diagnostic procedures such as breast and prostate biopsies  cosmetic procedures such as liposuction and dermal abrasions  interventional radiology procedures  and therapeutic procedures such as vasectomies and endometrial ablation procedures 
iv sedative medications are typically not offered to these patients because of the high cost of the specialized personnel and monitoring equipment 
despite the high potential for pain and anxiety  most patients currently undergo these procedures with only a local anesthetic  causing unnecessary discomfort 
we believe there is significant opportunity for a fast acting  effective and safe product that can provide mild levels of sedation  anxiety reduction and analgesia for painful procedures conducted in a physician s office without the need for specialized personnel to monitor the patient 
how arx addresses the unmet medical need for painful procedures in a physician s office the joint commission on the accreditation of healthcare organizations  or jcaho  mandates that iv sedation requires specialized monitoring  resuscitative equipment and appropriately trained staff 
as a result  many practitioners do not provide any iv sedation to their patients prior to or during painful procedures that take place in a physician s office  and instead rely only on the analgesic benefit of local anesthetics 
the anxiety and pain that an individual experiences during painful procedures in a physician s office without sedation has been studied and reported in peer reviewed journals 
ninety six percent of men report moderate pain immediately after prostate biopsy  with only of patients reporting no pain during the biopsy 
similarly  women undergoing breast biopsies have pre procedural scores averaging to out of for visual analog scale measurements of nervousness  tension and fearfulness 
this data highlights the need for a mild sedative with analgesic and anxiety reducing properties in addition to a local anesthetic for painful procedures in a physician s office 
we believe that arx can provide physicians with a non invasive  rapid acting product for mild sedation  anxiety reduction and pain relief during painful diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a physician s office 
we believe the availability of arx may increase the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed in a physician s office  resulting in cost savings because specialized personnel and equipment would not be necessary 

table of contents arx description arx sufentanil triazolam nanotab is a single  fixed dose sublingual product candidate designed to be administered by a healthcare professional prior to a painful procedure in a physician s office 
an important advantage of sufentanil and triazolam over other drugs in their classes is their rapid uptake from the sublingual mucosa 
our phase clinical data showed that administering arx via sublingual route prior to a procedure results in a rapid onset of mild sedation and reduction in anxiety in to minutes 
sufentanil and triazolam have short half lives compared to many other agents in the same class of compounds  enabling patients treated with arx to be discharged immediately following completion of the procedure 
the sublingual route of administration avoids the high plasma concentrations associated with iv delivery  thereby obviating the need for specialized personnel and extensive monitoring 
sufentanil triazolam nanotab arx clinical program summary we have completed a successful phase clinical trial of arx demonstrating rapid onset of mild sedation and anxiety reduction  with a low adverse event profile during an abdominal liposuction procedure 
we held end of phase meeting with the fda in may to discuss the phase clinical program and requirements for a nda filing 
two four arm factorial phase studies will be required with a minimum of patients exposed to active drug 
planned phase clinical trials for arx future development of arx is contingent upon additional funding or corporate partnership resources 
should such funds or resources become available  we could proceed with the planned trials and future development described below 
we would plan to conduct two phase efficacy and safety studies in a range of painful procedures  such as prostate biopsy  breast biopsy  vasectomy and low volume abdominal liposuction 
in each study  approximately patients will be randomized to treatment with one of the following sufentanil triazolam mcg mcg nanotab  sufentanil mcg nanotab  triazolam mcg nanotab  or placebo nanotab 
we intend to evaluate the time weighted summed richmond agitation sedation scale  or rass  score over the hour study period  or srs  compared to placebo as the primary efficacy endpoint 
rass is a ten point scale to evaluate agitated behavior where unarousable is graded as and combative is graded as a and a score of is alert and calm 
secondary endpoints are intended to include comparisons of srs among active comparator arms  patient report of procedural anxiety and pain intensity using an point numerical rating scale  or nrs  patient and physician global assessments of satisfaction with study drug and time to a modified aldrete score of readiness for discharge measurement 
the design for phase device for arx consists of a simple mechanical dispenser or sda 
we have produced several working prototypes 
phase and phase clinical results for arx we completed an initial dose finding study for three different strengths of sublingual sufentanil triazolam nanotabs mcg mcg  mcg mcg and mcg mcg in subjects 
the onset of sedation was approximately faster with the sufentanil mcg triazolam mcg nanotab treatment compared to the sufentanil mcg triazolam mcg nanotab treatment in younger subjects 
there were minimal differences between treatments for time to maximum sedation and for total duration of sedation  leading us to select the sufentanil mcg triazolam mcg nanotab dosage strength to study further in a phase trial 
we completed a phase study of analgesic and anxiety reducing efficacy of the sufentanil triazolam nanotab in patients undergoing an elective abdominal liposuction procedure 
the study was a prospective  randomized  
table of contents double blind  placebo controlled single center study in adult patients 
patients were randomly assigned to treatment with the sufentanil mcg triazolam mcg nanotab or placebo 
forty one patients were randomized and patients received study drug and underwent the procedure and completed the hour study period 
the mean age for all randomized patients was years range to years 
the primary endpoint was the srs and the sufentanil triazolam nanotab demonstrated superiority over placebo p 
the sufentanil triazolam nanotab was more effective than placebo in reducing anxiety as measured by the secondary endpoint  the nrs anxiety scale 
a significant difference p in anxiety score between the sufentanil triazolam nanotab and placebo was seen at minutes  the first time point measured after study drug dosing 
the sufentanil triazolam nanotab did not show a statistical difference from placebo in providing analgesia as measured by the nrs pain intensity scale p 
the summed pain intensity score was lower for the sufentanil triazolam nanotab compared to placebo for all time points  however  the difference was not significant with the small number of patients 
there was a statistically significant difference between the sufentanil triazolam nanotab treatment group and placebo p in the proportion of patients for which the physician rated the treatment very good or excellent on the global assessment of effectiveness and tolerability 
there was also a statistically significant difference between the sufentanil triazolam nanotab treatment group and placebo p for the proportion of patients who rated the treatment very good or excellent on the global assessment of effectiveness and tolerability 
all patients in both the sufentanil triazolam nanotab treatment group and the placebo group were ready for discharge immediately following the procedure 
there were no saes reported during treatment or hours after dosing 
the most frequent ae was nervous system disorders  which were observed in two patients in the sufentanil triazolam nanotab treatment group and in two patients in the placebo group 
dizziness was also reported by two patients in the sufentanil triazolam nanotab treatment group and one patient in the placebo group 
there were no significant differences between the treatment groups for any aes 
all events were mild or moderate in severity 
there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or oxygen saturation during the study 
there was no dispensing device used in the arx phase studies 
tablets were placed in the patients sublingual space through the use of forceps 

table of contents arx sufentanil single dose nanotab logo this product candidate has not been approved by the fda 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates 
the market opportunity for arx in addition to battlefield casualty treatment  if approved  we anticipate that arx could be useful in a variety of medically supervised settings including by paramedics during patient transport  in the emergency room  or for post operative patients  following either short stay or ambulatory surgery  who do not require more long term patient controlled analgesia 
according to the center for disease control  there were more than million emergency room visits in  and analgesics were provided or prescribed during more than million of these visits 
according to the american hospital association  there were million emergency room  or er  visits and million hospital based outpatient surgeries in the united states in in addition  according to the ambulatory surgery center association  over million procedures were conducted in ambulatory surgery centers in the united states in how arx addresses the unmet medical need for moderate to severe acute pain arx is a non invasive  fast onset sufentanil product candidate for treatment of patients with moderate to severe acute pain  either on the battlefield or in civilian settings of trauma or injury 
on the battlefield  in the emergency room and in ambulatory care environments  patients often do not have immediate iv access available 
intramuscular injections are a current standard of care on the battlefield  but they are invasive  painful and present an increased risk of infection to both patient and healthcare professional 
in addition  in cases of severe trauma where the patient is often in hypovolemic shock and muscles are not well perfused  pain medication given by intramuscular injection may not readily reach the bloodstream to provide pain relief  rendering this route of delivery suboptimal 
oral pills and liquids generally have slow and erratic onset of analgesia 
even patients with iv access may have undesirable side effects with the commonly used iv opioids morphine and hydromorphone  such as sedation or oxygen desaturation 
moreover  iv dosing results in high peak plasma levels  thereby limiting the opioid dose and requiring frequent redosing intervals to titrate to satisfactory analgesia 
additional treatment options are needed which can safely and rapidly treat acute trauma pain  in both civilian and military settings 
arx features sufentanil  a high therapeutic index opioid  in acelrx s proprietary nanotab technology that enables rapid sublingual absorption when the nanotab is placed under the tongue 
as a result  sufentanil nanotabs can provide rapid onset of analgesia and display a consistent pharmacokinetic profile due to a high percentage of drug being absorbed sublingually instead of through the gastrointestinal tract

sufentanil single dose nanotab arx clinical program summary in may  acelrx received a grant from the us army medical research and materiel command  or usamrmc  to conduct a phase dose finding study  and to prepare to enter phase in the phase study of arx  two different doses of sufentanil will be evaluated in patients suffering from moderate to severe acute pain  with the goal of determining an appropriate dose to take into phase planned phase clinical trial for arx our arx phase dose finding study will be a prospective  randomized  double blind multicenter trial in patients to years of age that are undergoing primary  unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery alone or with ipsilateral hammertoe repair 
the study will be conducted at sites that are experienced in running clinical trials of pain management treatment in a post operative setting  and each patient randomized to treatment will have one to one nursing care throughout the hour study period 
patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria following surgery will be randomly assigned to treatment with sufentanil nanotab mcg  sufentanil nanotab mcg  or placebo 
randomization will be stratified within each site by two age groups years and at least patients patients in sufentanil nanotab mcg group  patients in sufentanil nanotab mcg group and patients in placebo treatment group will receive study drug and provide primary efficacy data for analysis 
efficacy will be assessed as follows patient reports of pain intensity on an nrs  pain relief on a point pain relief scale  percentage of patients requiring rescue analgesics due to inadequate analgesia  and patient global assessment of effectiveness and tolerability 
also  a double stop watch technique will be used to assess onset of perceived and meaningful analgesia after the first dose of study drug 
the primary endpoint is the time weighted summed pain intensity difference spid over the hour study period spid 
secondary endpoints include time weighted total pain relief totpar over the hour study period totpar  proportion of patients requiring rescue analgesics due to inadequate analgesia over the hour study period  proportion of patients who responded in each category of the patient global assessment  time to onset of perceived and meaningful analgesia and time to first use of rescue analgesics and total number of doses of rescue analgesic used 
other potential applications for our nanotab technology we believe that as a platform technology  the nanotab  either as a standalone dosage form or in conjunction with various forms of dispensing mechanisms  has the potential to enable other product candidates utilizing a number of additional compounds to be delivered sublingually to the oral mucosa 
there are numerous compounds used for the treatment of pain as well as other therapeutic indications which are dosed in microgram quantities and possess characteristics that we believe make them potential candidates for sublingual delivery via the nanotab 
our strategy our strategy is to develop and commercialize a portfolio of sufentanil nanotab based products in specialty markets 
we have designed and are developing product candidates that have clearly defined clinical development programs  target large commercial market opportunities and require modest commercial organizations in the 
table of contents united states 
we selectively utilize third party contractors in order to maximize the capital efficiency of our development and commercialization efforts 
we plan to enter into partnerships to market our product candidates outside the united states 
our lead program  arx  has recently initiated its first phase safety and efficacy trial and is focused on the management of post operative pain in the hospital setting 
the second arx phase study is expected to begin in the second quarter of with the third and final planned arx phase study expected to begin in the third quarter of top line data from all three studies are expected by late or early and if clinical trial results are positive  we plan to submit an nda in mid and  if approved  to commercialize arx ourselves in the united states 
our second program  arx  is focused on the management of cancer breakthrough pain and has completed phase development 
based on the availability of financial resources  we plan to advance arx into phase trials  submit an nda and  if approved  commercialize arx ourselves or with a partner in the united states 
further development of arx will depend on the identification of a partner to support this effort 
development of arx beyond the current grant supported activities is contingent upon additional funding from the usamrmc or identification of a partner to support this effort 
our specific strategy with respect to arx is to complete two phase efficacy studies and one phase active comparator study and seek regulatory approval in the united states and other countries  establish at least one commercial relationship in north america for the manufacturing of the components of the sufentanil nanotab pca system  build a targeted hospital directed sales force in the united states  and partner with third parties for commercialization outside of the united states 
sales and marketing we anticipate developing a distribution capability and commercial organization in the united states to market and sell our product candidates alone or with partners  while out licensing commercialization rights outside of the united states 
in executing our strategy  our goal is to have significant control over the development process and commercial execution for our product candidates  while retaining meaningful economics 
we plan to progressively build commercial capability to support introduction of arx to the united states market as we move towards nda submission and approval 
we foresee two stages of commercial execution to support successful introduction of arx in the united states in parallel with our phase clinical studies and the filing and review of a nda for arx  we plan to highlight the clinical and health economic data identifying the limitations of iv pca in use today  increase awareness of the development of arx through publication of our clinical data  create and deploy a focused scientific support team to gather a detailed understanding of individual hospital needs in order to be prepared to present arx effectively at the time of commercial launch  establish advisory boards with anesthesiologists  surgeons and nurses to provide us with input on appropriate commercial positioning for arx for each of these key audiences  and design a post approval clinical development program  including potential head to head superiority studies with iv pca 
following fda approval  we plan to create and deploy a high quality  customer focused and experienced commercial organization dedicated to bringing innovative  highly valued healthcare solutions to patients  payors and healthcare providers  including building a targeted hospital directed sales force in the united states  
table of contents establish arx on hospital formularies through deployment of an experienced team to describe the clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefits of arx in comparison to iv pca  conduct post approval clinical program for arx  establish arx as the product of choice for traditional post operative pca  and expand the market through deployment of arx for hour stay patients  where iv pca is not used today

competition our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies  and medical technology companies 
we believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are the safety  efficacy and tolerability profile  reliability  convenience of dosing  price and reimbursement 
many of our potential competitors  including many of the organizations named below  have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products 
accordingly  our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining fda approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance 
our competitors drugs may be more effective  or may be more effectively marketed and sold  than any drug we may commercialize  which may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive before we can recover our losses 
we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available 
potential competition for arx we are developing arx  the sufentanil nanotab pca system  for the management of acute post operative pain in adult patients during hospitalization 
we believe that arx would compete with a number of opioid based treatment options that are currently available 
the market for opioids for post operative pain is large and competitive 
the primary competition for arx is the iv pca pump  which is widely used in the post operative setting 
leading manufacturers of iv pca pumps include hospira inc  carefusion corporation  baxter international inc  curlin medical  inc 
and smiths medical 
the most common opioids used to treat post operative pain are morphine  hydromorphone and fentanyl  all of which are available as generics 
also available on the market is the avancen medication on demand  or mod  oral pca device developed by avancen mod corporation 
also in development is moxduo  an orally administered  fixed ratio combination of morphine and oxycodone being developed by qrx pharma  an australian company 
this product is also in development as an iv product 
additional potential competitors for arx include products in development  including the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system  ionsys  originally developed by alza corporation and ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  both johnson johnson subsidiaries  and currently under development by incline therapeutics  inc  and rylomine  an intranasal morphine product developed by javelin pharmaceuticals  inc potential competition for arx we are developing arx  the sufentanil nanotab btp management system  for the treatment of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant patients  with an initial indication in cancer patients 
the market for opioids for treatment of cancer breakthrough pain is large and competitive  however  currently there are no sufentanil 
table of contents products approved by the fda for this indication 
our potential competitors for arx include products approved in the united states for cancer breakthrough pain  including actiq and fentora  currently manufactured by teva pharmaceuticals  onsolis  currently manufactured by biodelivery sciences international  inc  abstral  currently manufactured by prostrakan group plc  lazanda  currently manufactured by archimedes pharma limited  as well as products approved in europe  including instanyl  currently manufactured by nycomed international management gmbh 
the active ingredient in all approved products for cancer breakthrough pain is fentanyl 
additional potential competitors for arx include products in late stage development for cancer breakthrough pain  such as fentanyl taifun  currently manufactured by akela pharma  inc  and sl spray  currently manufactured by insys therapeutics  inc potential competition for arx we are developing arx  the sufentanil triazolam nanotab  for use in diagnostic or therapeutic painful procedures of short duration in a physician s office 
for these procedures  many practitioners rely primarily on local anesthetics injected to the procedural area to reduce the pain of the procedure  and do not use iv sedatives to manage the anxiety of patients because of the cost of having additional trained staff to monitor the patients 
currently  we are not aware of any products on the market which combine an opioid with a benzodiazepine in a single dosage form to manage the anxiety and pain of procedures in a physician s office 
we are not aware of any approved or development stage non iv sedative analgesic products that would present competition to arx in the future  there may be products developed or approved for this market which could directly compete with arx potential competition for arx competitors for arx within the military environment include intramuscular morphine injections which are marketed by a variety of generic manufacturers 
within the civilian environment  there are a wide variety of approved injectable and oral opioid products to treat moderate to severe acute pain  including iv opioids such as morphine  fentanyl  hydromorphone and meperidine or oral opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone 
pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply we currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufentanil and sufentanil triazolam nanotabs for our clinical studies under current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  with oversight by our internal managers 
equipment specific to the pharmaceutical manufacturing process was purchased and customized by us and is currently owned by us 
we plan to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and  potentially  collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the fda 
we currently rely on a single manufacturer for the preclinical and clinical supplies of our drug product for each of our product candidates and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for any of our product candidates 
we have identified other drug product manufacturers that could satisfy our clinical study requirements but this would require a significant delay in setting up the facility and moving equipment 
additionally  should a supplier or a manufacturer on whom we rely to produce a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or such product is later recalled  we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs

table of contents human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined phase the product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
in the case of some products for severe or life threatening diseases  especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers  the initial human testing is often conducted in patients 
phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted conditions and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule 
phase clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage  clinical safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
these studies are intended to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling 
progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the fda and safety reports must be submitted to the fda and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events 
the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
similarly  an institutional review board  or irb  can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the irb s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients 
concurrent with clinical studies  companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp and qsr for medical devices requirements 
the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and  among other things  the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity  strength  quality and purity of the final product

manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards  and test each product batch or lot prior to its release 
in the case of arx  the device component must comply with cfr we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products 
future fda and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct 
the fda may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
further  the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions  such as fines  warning letters  holds on clinical studies  product recalls or seizures  product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products  refusal to approve pending applications or supplements  restrictions on marketing or manufacturing  injunctions or civil or criminal penalties 
foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the united states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the united states 
the requirements and approval process vary from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 

table of contents controlled substances regulations sufentanil  a schedule ii controlled substance  is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the arx  arx  arx and arx nanotab product candidates 
triazolam  a schedule iv controlled substance  is also an active pharmaceutical ingredient in arx controlled substances are governed by the drug enforcement administration  or dea  of the us department of justice 
the handling of controlled substances and or drug product by us  our contract manufacturers  analytical laboratories  packagers and distributors  are regulated by the controlled substances act and title cfr  part our current supply chain is also subject to the regulations of health canada s drug strategy and controlled substances programme  and specifically  the office of controlled substances 
unforeseen delays to the drug substance and drug product manufacture and supply chain may occur due to delays  errors or other unforeseen problems with the permitting process 
also  any one of our suppliers  contract manufacturers  laboratories  packagers and or distributors could be the subject of dea violations and enforcement could lead to delays or even loss of dea license by the contractors 
health law compliance in addition to fda laws and regulations  we must comply with a variety of federal and state laws governing  among other things  the privacy of healthcare information  our relationships with healthcare providers and the reimbursement of prescription drug products 
although the federal health care program anti kickback statute has a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases  or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payer 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors  it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws 
such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in march  the patient protection and affordable health care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or collectively the ppaca  was enacted  which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers 
many of the details regarding the implementation of the ppaca are yet to be determined  and at this time  it remains unclear the full effect that the ppaca would have on our business 
research and development conducting research and development is central to our business model 
we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to continue development of arx and arx and subsequently advance the development of arx and arx employees as of december   we employed full time employees  all of whom are located at our headquarters in redwood city  california 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 

table of contents item a 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking information based on our current expectations 
because our actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us  this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our actual future results  including  but not limited to  our revenues  expenses  net loss and loss per share 
we believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this form k 
if any of the following risks comes to fruition  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our financial condition and need for additional capital we have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
we are a development stage company with limited operating history 
to date  we have focused primarily on developing our lead product candidate  the sufentanil nanotab pca system  or arx we have three additional product candidates  the sufentanil nanotab btp management system  or arx  the sufentanil triazolam nanotab  or arx and sufentanil single dose acute pain nanotab  or arx we have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception in july and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development  including our non clinical development activities and clinical trials 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt 
the size of our future net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues 
to date  none of our product candidates have been commercialized  and if our product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized  or if revenues are insufficient following marketing approval  we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail 
even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates in the united states  our revenues are also dependent upon the size of the markets outside of the united states  as well as our ability to obtain market approval and achieve commercial success 
we expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we expand our research and development activities and advance our clinical programs 
we also expect an increase in our expenses associated with preparing for the potential commercialization of arx as a result of the foregoing  we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we have never generated any product or commercial revenue and may never be profitable 
our ability to generate revenue from commercial sales and achieve profitability depends on our ability  alone or with collaborators  to successfully complete the development of  obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for  and commercialize our product candidates 
other than the revenue received from the us army medical research and material command for research and development reimbursement under the terms of the grant for arx  we do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of our product candidates for the foreseeable future  if ever 
our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in completing the clinical development of arx  initially for the treatment of post operative pain in the hospital setting  obtaining regulatory approval for arx  launching and commercializing arx  including building a hospital directed sales force in the us and collaborating with third parties internationally  and completing the clinical development of  obtaining regulatory approval for  launching and commercializing arx  arx and arx  which will require additional funding 

table of contents because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development  we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses  or when  or if  we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to perform studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate 
even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale  we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate 
even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products  we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations 
we have a limited operating history that may make it difficult to predict our future performance or evaluate our business and prospects 
we were incorporated in since inception  our operations have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company  developing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates 
we have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
consequently  any predictions you make about our future success or viability or evaluation of our business and prospects may not be accurate 
if we fail to obtain additional financing  we would be forced to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development programs 
developing pharmaceutical products  including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  is expensive 
we expect our research and development expenses to substantially increase in connection with our ongoing activities  particularly as we advance our clinical programs  including the start of our phase arx studies 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operations into the first quarter of we will need to raise substantial additional funds to support our future operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
additionally  changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate 
for example  we believe our existing cash resources are adequate to complete all three arx phase clinical trials  however  our clinical trials may encounter technical  enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expected 
in any event  we will require substantial additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for  and to commercialize  our product candidates 
raising funds in the current economic environment  when the capital markets have been affected by the global recession  may present additional challenges 
securing additional financing may divert our management from our day to day activities  which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms  we may be required to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates  seek corporate partners for arx at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that might be less favorable than might otherwise be available  or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms  our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 

table of contents if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  we will not be able to continue our planned level of operations beyond the first quarter of  complete the development activities required to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the fda  nor pursue commercialization efforts  all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and prospects 
we may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations  which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business 
in order to raise additional funds to support our operations  we may sell additional equity or debt securities  which would result in dilution to all of our stockholders or impose restrictive covenants that adversely impact our business 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and dilution to all of our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants  such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt  limitations on our ability to acquire  sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 
if we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations 
we might be unable to service our current debt due to a lack of cash flow and might be subject to default 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement with hercules technology ii  lp and hercules technology growth capital  inc  collectively referred to as hercules  under which we may borrow up to million in two tranches of million each  represented by secured convertible term promissory notes 
we drew the first tranche of million upon closing of the transaction in june and the second tranche of million in december we used a portion of the proceeds from the first tranche to repay the remaining obligations under that certain loan and security agreement between us and pinnacle ventures  llc  dated september the interest rate is initially  with months of interest only payments 
any notes issued pursuant to the loan and security agreement mature on december  we granted to hercules a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets  with the exception of our intellectual property  where the security interest is limited to proceeds of intellectual property 
if we do not make the required payments when due  either at maturity  or at applicable installment payment dates  if we breach the agreement or become insolvent  hercules could elect to declare all amounts outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and penalty  to be immediately due and payable 
even if we were able to prepay the full amount in cash  any such repayment could leave us with little or no working capital for our business 
if we are unable to repay those amounts  hercules will have a first claim on our assets pledged under the loan agreement 
if hercules should attempt to foreclose on the collateral  it is unlikely that there would be any assets remaining after repayment in full of such secured indebtedness 
any default under the loan agreement and resulting foreclosure would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to continue our operations 
risks related to clinical development and regulatory approval we depend substantially on the success of our product candidate  arx  which is still under clinical development  and may not obtain regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized 
we have not marketed  distributed or sold any products 
the success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize arx  for the treatment of post operative pain 
in march  we initiated the first of three phase clinical studies  with top line data expected in the second half of we believe our existing capital resources will be adequate to support operations into the first quarter of and will be adequate to complete all three arx phase clinical trials 
contingent on our ability to raise additional 
table of contents funding  we intend to use these completed trials as a basis to submit an nda for arx later in there is no guarantee that our phase clinical trials  or any of the remaining pharmacokinetic studies  or pk studies  or non clinical studies to be included in the nda  will be completed  or if completed  will be successful 
any delay in obtaining  or inability to obtain  regulatory approval would prevent us from commercializing arx  generating revenues and achieving profitability 
if any of these events occur  we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for arx  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations 
we depend substantially on the successful completion of phase clinical trials for our product candidates 
the positive clinical results obtained for our product candidates in phase clinical studies may not be repeated in phase while we have completed multiple phase clinical studies for arx  arx and arx  we have never completed a phase clinical trial 
our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical and medical device development 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate  we must successfully complete phase clinical trials 
negative or inconclusive results of a phase clinical study could cause the fda to require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies 
the fda could analyze our data using alternative imputation strategies and determine that the trial was negative or inconclusive 
furthermore  while we have obtained positive safety and efficacy results for our sufentanil based product candidates during our prior clinical trials  we cannot be certain that these results will be duplicated when our product candidates are tested in a larger number of patients in our phase clinical trials 
delays in clinical trials are common and have many causes  and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales 
we may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates 
we plan to conduct three phase studies in we have successfully initiated the first of three phase studies 
our current and planned clinical trials may not begin on time  have an effective design  enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule  if at all 
our clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial  delays in pharmacokinetic studies required to submit an nda  delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial  delays in reaching agreement with the fda on final trial design  delays in completing the required device human factor studies and software validation to the satisfaction of the fda  imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the fda or other regulatory authorities  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical trial sites  delays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site  delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial  delays in the testing  validation  manufacturing and delivery of the device components of our product candidates  delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post treatment follow up  clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment  
table of contents time required to add new clinical sites  or delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials 
if initiation or completion of the planned phase trials or phase trial are delayed for our product candidates for any of the above reasons  our development costs may increase  our approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize and commence sales of our product candidates could be materially harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance 
adverse events  or aes  caused by our product candidates could cause us  other reviewing entities  clinical study sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval 
phase clinical studies conducted by us with our arx  arx and arx product candidates have generated some aes  but no serious adverse events  or saes  related to the study drug 
for example  in arx clinical studies completed to date  of the patients experienced vomiting and experienced itching for mcg and mcg treated groups  as compared to the placebo treated subjects  of which experienced vomiting and none experienced itching 
if saes related to the study drug are observed in any of our clinical studies  our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted 
further  if our products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval  a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result  including regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in a form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements  such as warnings or contraindications  we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical studies  we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients  or our reputation may suffer 
any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates 
additional time may be required to obtain regulatory approval for our arx product candidate because it is a drug device combination 
arx is a drug device combination product candidate with both drug and device components submitted in the investigational new drug application 
based on our discussions with the fda  we believe that arx is viewed as a combination product by the fda  and both drug and device components will be required for review as part of an nda submission 
there are very few examples of the fda approval process for drug device combination products such as arx as a result  we have in the past and may in the future experience delays for arx due to regulatory uncertainties in the product development and approval process  in particular as it relates to a drug device product approval under an nda 

table of contents after the completion of our clinical trials  we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any of our product candidates  and we cannot  therefore  predict the timing of any future revenue 
we cannot commercialize any of our product candidates  including arx  until the appropriate regulatory authorities  such as the fda  have reviewed and approved the product candidate 
the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner  or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for arx additional delays may result if arx is taken before an fda advisory committee which may recommend restrictions on approval or recommend non approval 
in addition  we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action  or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development  clinical studies and the review process 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for arx and our other product candidates  we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties 
even if we obtain regulatory approval in the united states  the fda may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates  or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post approval studies or post market surveillance 
for example  the labeling ultimately approved for arx and our other product candidates will likely include restrictions on use due to the opioid nature of sufentanil 
arx and our other product candidates will also be subject to ongoing fda requirements governing the labeling  packaging  storage  distribution  safety surveillance  advertising  promotion  record keeping and reporting of safety and other post market information 
the holder of an approved nda is obligated to monitor and report aes and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the nda 
the holder of an approved nda must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product  product labeling or manufacturing process 
advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda rules and are subject to fda review  in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws 
in addition  manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  and adherence to commitments made in the nda 
if we  or a regulatory agency  discover previously unknown problems with a product  such as aes of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured  a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility  including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of our product candidate  a regulatory agency may issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law  seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines  suspend or withdraw regulatory approval  suspend any ongoing clinical trials  refuse to approve a pending nda or supplements to an nda submitted by us  seize product  or refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts  including government contracts 
any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity 
the occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenues 

table of contents even if we obtain fda approval for arx or any of our product candidates in the united states  we may never obtain approval for or commercialize our products outside of the united states  which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential 
in order to market any products outside of the united states  we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy 
clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries  and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country 
approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods 
seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non clinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming 
regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries 
we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction  including international markets  and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets 
if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals  or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed  our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed 
arx and our other product candidates will require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  or rems 
the fda amendments act of implemented safety related changes to product labeling and require the adoption of rems 
our product candidates will require rems 
the rems may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients  special communication plans to health care professionals and restrictions on distribution and use 
while we have received information from the fda regarding certain aspects of the required rems for arx  we cannot predict the specific rems to be required as part of the fda s approval of arx depending on the extent of the rems requirements  our costs to commercialize arx may increase significantly 
arx  arx and arx  if approved  will also require rems programs that may increase our costs to commercialize these product candidates 
furthermore  risks of sufentanil that are not adequately addressed through proposed rems for our product candidates may also prevent or delay their approval for commercialization 
risks related to our reliance on third parties we rely on third party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies  and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails many risks including the inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently  a delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity  manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale up of manufacturing  costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale up  a failure to comply with cgmp and similar foreign standards  the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms  termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us  the reliance on a limited number of sources  and in some cases  single sources for product components  such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components  we will be unable to manufacture and sell our product candidates in a timely fashion  in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms  
table of contents the lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier  operations of our third party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations  including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier  carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control  and the failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner 
any of these events could lead to clinical study delays  failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products 
some of these events could be the basis for fda action  including injunction  recall  seizure  or total or partial suspension of production 
we rely on limited sources of supply for the drug component of our product candidates and any disruption in the chain of supply may cause delay in developing and commercializing our product candidates 
currently  we use two established suppliers of sufentanil citrate for our nanotabs 
for each product candidate  only one of the two suppliers will be qualified as a vendor with the fda 
if supply from the approved vendor is interrupted  there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply 
the alternative vendor would need to be qualified through an nda supplement which could result in further delay 
the fda or other regulatory agencies outside of the united states may also require additional studies if a new sufentanil supplier is relied upon for commercial production 
in addition  the drug enforcement administration  or the dea  may reduce  delay or refuse our quota for sufentanil  which would disrupt our supply of sufentanil citrate and cause delay in the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
currently  we use one supplier of triazolam for our arx nanotabs 
switching triazolam suppliers may involve substantial cost and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines 
these factors could cause the delay of clinical trials  regulatory submissions  required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates  cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing them successfully 
furthermore  if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices  and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost  our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue 
manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs requires specialized equipment and expertise 
ethanol  which is used in the manufacturing process  is flammable  and sufentanil is a highly potent  schedule ii compound 
these factors necessitate the use of specialized equipment and facilities for manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs 
there are a limited number of facilities that can accommodate our manufacturing process and we need to use dedicated equipment throughout development and commercial manufacturing to avoid the possibility of cross contamination 
if our equipment breaks down or needs to be repaired or replaced  it may cause significant disruption in clinical or commercial supply  which could result in delay in the process of obtaining approval for or sale of our products 
furthermore  we are using one manufacturer to produce our sufentanil nanotabs and have not identified a back up commercial facility to date 
any problems with our existing facility or equipment may delay or impair our ability to complete our clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates and increase our cost 
manufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization 
as we scale up manufacturing of our product candidates and conduct required stability testing  product  packaging  equipment and process related issues may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with 
table of contents our planned clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for commercial marketing 
in the past we have identified impurities in our product candidates 
in the future we may identify significant impurities  which could result in increased scrutiny by the regulatory agencies  delays in clinical program and regulatory approval  increases in our operating expenses  or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products 
historically  we have manufactured the majority of our nanotab supplies at patheon in toronto  canada 
during the third quarter of  we transferred our manufacturing capabilities to patheon s facility in cincinnati  ohio where we have built out a suite within their existing buildings that will serve as a manufacturing facility for clinical and commercial supplies of nanotabs 
the new facility has been qualified  however  we have not yet produced clinical or commercial supplies out of this facility and issues may arise in production pertaining to the new facility  or otherwise  which may adversely affect our clinical and commercial plans 
in addition  the fda or other regulatory agencies may require that a bioequivalence study be conducted  which is designed to ensure that the phase drug lots made at patheon  toronto are equivalent to one of the registration drug lots made at patheon  cincinnati 
there is risk that the study could fail the fda s bioequivalence requirements which would adversely affect our clinical and commercial plans 
our designs for the device components of our product candidates for phase clinical trials may not be fully functional or commercially viable 
the arx device we are using in phase clinical trials and plan to use commercially  or the phase device  has more features than the device used in phase  including additional software 
we have conducted multiple design validation  software verification and validation  reprocessing and human factors studies  which have informed the design of the phase device and we plan to conduct one or more summative human factors studies in however  we cannot predict if the phase device will be fully functional or acceptable throughout the phase clinical trials or for commercial use 
if we need to modify the phase device either before  during or after the planned phase studies  we may incur higher costs and experience delay in regulatory approval and commercialization of arx furthermore  if the changes to the device are substantial  we may need to conduct further clinical studies in order to have the commercial device approved by the fda 
we have limited experience manufacturing the arx phase device on a clinical scale  no experience on a commercial scale and do not own or operate a manufacturing facility 
we have manufactured arx devices and supplies on a small scale  including those needed for the first phase clinical study 
we continue to rely on contract manufacturers  component fabricators and secondary service providers to produce the necessary arx devices for the remaining phase clinical trials and the commercial marketplace 
we currently outsource manufacturing and packaging of the controller  dispenser and cartridge components of the arx device to third parties and intend to continue to do so 
these purchases of phase devices and components were made and will continue to be made utilizing short term purchase agreements and we may not be able to enter into long term agreements for commercial supply of arx with third party manufacturers  or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms 
we may encounter unanticipated problems in the scale up and automation process that will result in delays in the manufacturing of the arx cartridge  dispenser or controller 
we may not be able to establish additional sources of supply for device manufacture 
such suppliers are subject to fda regulations requiring that materials be produced under current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps  or quality system regulations  or qsr  and subject to ongoing inspections by regulatory agencies 
failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in delays and interruptions to our product candidate supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates ourselves  including the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control  and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities 

table of contents we rely on third parties to conduct  supervise and monitor our clinical studies  and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner  it may harm our business 
we have selected and executed agreements with our cro to conduct our first two phase clinical studies for arx and for the phase study for arx we will rely on this cro  along with other cros  as well as clinical trial sites  to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials 
while we have agreements governing their activities  we have limited influence over their actual performance 
we have relied and plan to continue to rely upon cros to monitor and manage data for our ongoing clinical programs for arx and our other product candidates  as well as the execution of nonclinical studies 
we control only certain aspects of our cros activities 
nevertheless  we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol  legal  regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the cros does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities 
we and our cros are required to comply with the fda s current good clinical practices  or cgcps  which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the fda for all of our product candidates in clinical development 
the fda enforces these cgcps through periodic inspections of trial sponsors  principal investigators and clinical trial sites 
if we or our cros fail to comply with applicable cgcps  the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications 
upon inspection  the fda may determine that our phase clinical trials do not comply with cgcps 
in addition  our phase clinical trials will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of arx accordingly  if our cros fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients  we may be required to repeat the phase clinical trials  which would delay the regulatory approval process 
our cros are not our employees  and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and nonclinical programs 
these cros may also have relationships with other commercial entities  including our competitors  for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies  or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position 
we face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by cros  which may allow our potential competitors to access our proprietary technology 
if our cros do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations  fail to meet expected deadlines  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements  or for any other reasons  our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for  or successfully commercialize arx  or our other product candidates 
as a result  our financial results and the commercial prospects for arx and any future product candidates that we develop would be harmed  our costs could increase  and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed 
development of arx is dependent on funding from our government grant with the us army medical research and material command  or usamrmc 
in may  we entered into an award contract with the usamrmc  effective june   in which the usamrmc granted approximately million to us in order to support the development of arx  a sufentanil nanotab for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain 
under the terms of the grant  the usamrmc will reimburse us for development  manufacturing and clinical costs necessary to prepare for and complete the planned phase dose finding trial in a study of acute moderate to severe pain  and to prepare to enter phase development 
the period of research under the grant ends on august   with a final report due on september  the grant gives the usamrmc the option to extend the term of the grant and provide additional funding for the research 
development of arx is dependent on the continued performance by the usamrmc of its responsibilities under this agreement  including adequate continued funding of usamrmc programs as well as the prompt processing of usamrmc s internal approvals necessary to initiate the phase clinical study 
we have no control over the resources and funding that usamrmc may devote to this or future agreements  which may be subject to annual renewal and which generally may be terminated by usamrmc at any time 

table of contents usamrmc may fail to perform their responsibilities under the agreement  which may cause them to be terminated 
in addition  we may fail to perform our responsibilities under the agreement 
our government agreement is subject to audits  which may occur several years after the period to which the audit relates 
if an audit identifies significant unallowable costs  we could incur a material charge to our earnings or reduction in our cash position 
as a result  we may be unsuccessful in entering  or ineligible to enter  into future government agreements 
there can be no assurances that this agreement will continue or that we will be able to enter into new contracts with usamrmc or obtain funding from other sources to continue to support development of arx beyond the phase clinical study and preparation for phase activities 
the process of obtaining usamrmc contracts is lengthy and uncertain and we will have to compete with other companies for each contract 
further  changes in government budgets and agendas may result in a decreased and de prioritized emphasis on supporting research and development programs  including arx risks related to commercialization of our product candidates the commercial success of arx and our other product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community  including physicians  patients and health care payors 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors  including demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products  the relative convenience  ease of administration and acceptance by physicians  patients and health care payors  the prevalence and severity of any aes  overcoming the perception of sufentanil as a potentially unsafe drug due to its high potency  limitations or warnings contained in the fda approved label for arx  availability of alternative treatments  pricing and cost effectiveness  the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators sales and marketing strategies  our ability to obtain hospital formulary approval  our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third party coverage or reimbursement  and the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of third party coverage 
if arx is approved  but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians  patients and health care payors  we may not generate sufficient revenue from arx and we may not become or remain profitable 
if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates  we may be unable to generate any revenue 
we currently do not have an organization for the sales  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost effectiveness of doing so 
in order to market any products that may be approved  we must build our sales  marketing  managerial and other non technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
we intend to enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates outside of the united states 
we will also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for our product candidates in the united states 

table of contents to date  we have not entered into any strategic partnerships for any of our product candidates 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners  and these strategic partnerships can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document 
we may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms  or at all 
we are unable to predict when  if ever  we will enter into any strategic partnerships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships 
our strategy for arx is to develop a hospital directed sales force and or collaborate with third parties to promote the product to healthcare professionals and third party payors in the united states 
our future collaboration partners  if any  may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of our product candidates to healthcare professionals and in geographical regions  including the united states  that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force  or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our product candidates  our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be adversely affected 
until we are able to negotiate a strategic partnership or obtain additional financial resources for arx or arx  we will not progress development or generate any revenue from these product candidates 
we are developing arx under a grant from usamrmc and if a follow on grant from usamrmc to cover phase costs is not obtained  we may be required to curtail all activities associated with arx in addition  without a partnership or additional grant funding  we would bear all the risk related to the development of arx  arx or arx if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities ourselves  we will need to obtain additional capital  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we do not have sufficient funds  we will not be able to bring arx  arx or arx to market or generate product revenue 
if we are unable to establish adequate sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  whether independently or with third parties  we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable 
we will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions  we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies 
if we obtain approval to commercialize our products outside of the united states  a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business 
if our product candidates are approved for commercialization  we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market arx outside the united states 
we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships  including different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  unexpected changes in tariffs  trade barriers and regulatory requirements  economic weakness  including inflation  or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets  compliance with tax  employment  immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad  foreign taxes  including withholding of payroll taxes  foreign currency fluctuations  which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues  and other obligations incident to doing business in another country  workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the united states  production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad  and 
table of contents business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions  including war and terrorism  or natural disasters including earthquakes  typhoons  floods and fires 
if we  or potential partners  are unable to compete effectively  our product candidates may not reach their commercial potential 
the market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances 
if our product candidates obtain fda approval  they will compete with a number of existing and future pharmaceuticals and drug delivery devices developed  manufactured and marketed by others 
we or potential partners will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations 
the primary competition for arx is the iv pca pump  which is widely used in the post operative setting 
leading manufacturers of iv pca pumps include hospira inc  carefusion corporation  baxter international inc  curlin medical  inc 
and smiths medical 
the most common opioids used to treat post operative pain are morphine  hydromorphone and fentanyl  all of which are available as generics 
also available on the market is the avancen medication on demand  or mod  oral pca device developed by avancen mod corporation 
also in development is moxduo  an orally administered  fixed ratio combination of morphine and oxycodone being developed by qrx pharma  an australian company 
this product is also in development as an iv product 
additional potential competitors for arx include products in development  including the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system  ionsys  originally developed by alza corporation and ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  both johnson johnson subsidiaries  and currently under development by incline therapeutics  inc  and rylomine  an intranasal morphine product developed by javelin pharmaceuticals  inc our potential competitors for arx include products approved in the united states for cancer breakthrough pain  including actiq and fentora  currently manufactured by teva pharmaceuticals  onsolis  currently manufactured by biodelivery sciences international  inc  abstral  currently manufactured by prostrakan group plc  lazanda  currently manufactured by archimedes pharma limited  as well as products approved in europe  including instanyl  currently manufactured by nycomed international management gmbh 
the active ingredient in all approved products for cancer breakthrough pain is fentanyl 
additional potential competitors for arx include products in late stage development for cancer breakthrough pain  such as fentanyl taifun  currently manufactured by akela pharma  inc  and sl spray  currently manufactured by insys therapeutics  inc we are not aware of any approved or development stage non iv sedative analgesic products that would present competition to arx in the future  there may be products developed or approved for this market which could directly compete with arx competitors for arx within the military environment include intramuscular morphine injections which are marketed by a variety of generic manufacturers 
within the civilian environment  there are a wide variety of approved injectable and oral opioid products to treat moderate to severe acute pain  including iv opioids such as morphine  fentanyl  hydromorphone and meperidine or oral opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone 
it is possible that any of these competitors could develop or improve technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive  which could adversely affect our revenue potential 
key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy  safety profile  reliability  convenience of dosing  price and reimbursement 
many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates  obtaining fda and other regulatory approval of products and the commercialization of those products 
accordingly  our competitors 
table of contents may be more successful than we are in obtaining fda approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance 
our competitors drugs or drug delivery systems may be more effective  have fewer adverse effects  be less expensive to develop and manufacture  or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize 
this may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive before we can recover our losses 
we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and additional technologies become available 
these entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors  which may adversely affect our competitive position 
finally  the development of different methods for the treatment of post operative pain or breakthrough pain could render arx and arx  respectively  non competitive or obsolete 
these and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations 
hospital formulary approval and reimbursement may not be available for arx and our other product candidates  which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably 
obtaining formulary approval can be an expensive and time consuming process 
we cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell our products into our target markets 
failure to obtain timely formulary approval will limit our commercial success 
furthermore  market acceptance and sales of arx  or any future product candidates that we develop  will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures 
government authorities and third party payors  such as private health insurers  hospitals and health maintenance organizations  decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for arx  or any future product candidates 
also  reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for  or the price of  our products 
if reimbursement is not available  or is available only to limited levels  we may not be able to successfully commercialize arx  or any future product candidates that we develop 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
these legislative and or regulatory changes may negatively impact the reimbursement for our products  following approval 
the availability of numerous generic pain medications may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for arx the potential application of user fees to generic drug products may expedite the approval of additional pain medication generic drugs 
we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of arx and any other products that we develop  due to the trend toward managed healthcare  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes 
if we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so  we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed 
risks related to our business operations and industry failure to comply with the drug enforcement administration regulations  or the cost of compliance with these regulations  may adversely affect our business 
our sufentanil based products are subject to extensive regulation by the dea  due to their status as scheduled drugs 
sufentanil is a schedule ii opioid  considered to present the highest risk of abuse 
the manufacture  shipment  storage  sale and use of controlled substances are subject to a high degree of regulation  including security  record keeping and reporting obligations enforced by the dea 
this high degree of regulation can result in significant costs in order to comply with the required regulations  which may have an adverse effect on the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the dea limits the availability and production of all schedule ii substances  including sufentanil  through a quota system 
the dea requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas to manufacturers 
our contract manufacturers have applied annually for a quota on our behalf 
in future years  we may need greater amounts of sufentanil to sustain and complete our phase development program for arx  and we will need significantly greater amounts of sufentanil to 
table of contents implement our commercialization plans if the fda approves arx any delay or refusal by the dea in establishing the procurement quota or a reduction in our quota for sufentanil or a failure to increase it over time to meet anticipated increases in demand could delay or stop the clinical development or commercial sale of arx this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
in addition  historically we have purchased sufentanil in the united states and have shipped it to our third party manufacturer  patheon inc in toronto  canada  where much of our clinical trial manufacturing has been completed to date 
while we transferred manufacturing responsibilities to patheon s facility in cincinnati  ohio in the third quarter of  we may elect or need to use patheon s facility in toronto  canada at some point in the future 
shipping across international borders is a bureaucratic process that takes a minimum of three months and requires permits for both import and export 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or fail to submit permit applications in a timely manner  the government could refuse to permit sufentanil to be exported and imported between canada and the united states 
our failure to comply with these requirements could result in increased costs  delayed shipments  the loss of dea registration for one of our suppliers  significant restrictions on arx or any of our product candidates  civil penalties or criminal prosecution and delays in conducting our clinical trials 
drug enforcement administration regulations require that sufentanil be manufactured in the united states if sufentanil based products are to be marketed in the united states  and there is no guarantee that we will secure a commercial supply agreement with a manufacturer based in the united states 
a substantial portion of our clinical trial manufacturing to date has been completed at patheon inc in toronto  canada 
because the dea requires that sufentanil be manufactured in the united states if our product candidates are marketed in the united states  we transferred our manufacturing capability in the third quarter of from patheon in toronto  canada to patheon s production facility in cincinnati  ohio 
there can be no assurance that the technology transfer process will be completed in a timely manner which could result in a delay in submitted an nda 
in addition  we do not yet have a commercial supply contract in place 
if we cannot establish a supply contract on commercially reasonable terms  or if equipment manufacture or modifications do not meet expected deadlines  the timing for nda submission may be delayed 
switching or adding commercial manufacturing capability can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus  as well as additional regulatory filings 
in addition  there is a natural transition period when a new manufacturing facility commences work 
as a result  delays may occur  which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired commercial timelines  thereby increasing our costs and reducing our ability to generate revenue 
the facilities of any of our future manufacturers of sufentanil containing nanotabs must be approved by the fda after we submit our nda and before approval of arx and our other product candidates 
we do not control the manufacturing process of sufentanil nanotabs and are completely dependent on these third party manufacturing partners for compliance with the fda s requirements for manufacture 
in addition  although our third party manufacturers are well established commercial manufacturers  we are dependent on their continued adherence to cgmp manufacturing and acceptable changes to their process 
if our manufacturers do not meet the fda s strict regulatory requirements  they will not be able to secure fda approval for their manufacturing facilities 
if the fda does not approve these facilities for the commercial manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs  we will need to find alternative suppliers  which would result in significant delays in obtaining fda approval for arx these challenges may have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 

table of contents business interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our products and could disrupt our sales 
our headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area  near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to other types of natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations 
we do not carry insurance for earthquakes or other natural disasters and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur 
any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we are highly dependent on principal members of our executive team  the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives 
while we have entered into offer letters with each of our executive officers  any of them could leave our employment at any time  as all of our employees are at will employees 
recruiting and retaining other qualified employees for our business  including scientific and technical personnel  will also be critical to our success 
there is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry  which is likely to continue 
as a result  competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets 
in addition  failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
the inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee might impede the progress of our research  development and commercialization objectives 
we will need to expand our organization  and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth  which could disrupt our operations 
as of december   we had full time employees 
as our company matures  we expect to expand our employee base to increase our managerial  scientific and engineering  operational  sales  marketing  financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors 
future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities on our management  including the need to identify  recruit  maintain  motivate and integrate additional employees  consultants and contractors 
also  our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day to day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities 
we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations  which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure  give rise to operational mistakes  loss of business opportunities  loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees 
our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects  such as the development of additional product candidates 
if our management is unable to effectively manage our growth  our expenses may increase more than expected  our ability to generate and or grow revenues could be reduced  and we may not be able to implement our business strategy 
our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize arx and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to effectively manage any future growth 
we face potential product liability  and  if successful claims are brought against us  we may incur substantial liability 
the use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers  health care providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products 
if we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims  we could incur substantial liability and costs 
in addition  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in impairment of our business reputation  withdrawal of clinical study participants  
table of contents costs due to related litigation  distraction of management s attention from our primary business  substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants  the inability to commercialize our product candidates  and decreased demand for our product candidates  if approved for commercial sale 
our current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer 
moreover  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability 
if and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates  we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products  however  we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts 
on occasion  large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and  if judgments exceed our insurance coverage  could adversely affect our results of operations and business 
risks related to our intellectual property we have numerous pending patent applications in the united states  and one issued patent in europe 
if our pending patent applications fail to issue  our business will be adversely affected 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates  as well as successfully defending our current and future patents against third party challenges 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on patents as well as other intellectual property protections  including trade secrets  nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality provisions 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents 
as of december   we are the owner of record of one issued european patent which expires in  and we are pursuing us non provisional patent applications  two pending international patent cooperation treaty applications and foreign national applications  including six european regional phase applications directed to our product candidates 
the patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the united states or in foreign countries 
even if the patents do successfully issue  third parties may challenge the patents 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies  including us  can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the united states 
legal developments may preclude or limit the scope of available patent protection 
litigation involving patents  patent applications and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming 
if we are involved in such litigation  it could cause delays in bringing our product candidates to market and interfere with our business 
our commercial success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
although we are not currently aware of litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates  the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
as we enter our target markets  it is possible that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products and or processes infringe their intellectual property rights 
these third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents covering products or processes that are similar to  or may include compositions or methods that encompass our technology  allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents 

table of contents in a patent infringement claim against us  we may assert  as a defense  that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims  that the patent is invalid or both 
the strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted  the interpretation of these patents  and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents 
however  we could be unsuccessful in advancing non infringement and or invalidity arguments in our defense 
in the united states  issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity  and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity  which is a high burden of proof 
conversely  the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence  which is a lower burden of proof 
if we were found by a court to have infringed a valid patent claim  we could be prevented from using the patented technology or be required to pay the owner of the patent for the right to license the patented technology 
if we decide to pursue a license to one or more of these patents  we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or the license we obtain may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patent rights 
for example  if the relevant patent is owned by a competitor  that competitor may choose not to license patent rights to us 
if we decide to develop alternative technology  we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost effective manner  if at all 
in addition  because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time there may currently be pending applications  unknown to us  that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products 
it is possible that we may in the future receive  particularly as a public company  communications from competitors and other companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents  trade secrets or other intellectual property rights  offering licenses to such intellectual property or threatening litigation 
in addition to patent infringement claims  third parties may assert copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights against us 
we may need to expend considerable resources to counter such claims and may not be able to successful in our defense 
our business may suffer if a finding of infringement is established 
it is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights  and we may not be able to ensure their protection 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the united states 
the pharmaceutical patent situation outside the united states is even more uncertain 
changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property 
on september   the leahy smith america invents act  or the leahy smith act  was signed into law 
the leahy smith act includes a number of significant changes to united states patent law 
these include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation 
the united states patent office is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the leahy smith act  and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahy smith act will not become effective until one year or months after its enactment 
accordingly  it is not clear what  if any  impact the leahy smith act will have on the operation of our business 
however  the leahy smith act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
accordingly  we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently or may in the future own or license from third parties 
further  if any patents license we obtain is deemed invalid and or unenforceable  it could impact our ability to commercialize or partner our technology 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain  and we cannot ensure that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications  
table of contents we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  any patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products  will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business 
if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have  which could materially harm our business  negatively affect our position in the marketplace  limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability 
we may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information 
we rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know how and technological advances  especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  outside scientific collaborators  sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights 
failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional  material adverse effects upon our competitive business position 
periodic maintenance fees  renewal fees  annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and or applications will be due to be paid to the united states patent and trademark office and various foreign governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and or applications 
we have systems in place  including use of third party vendors  to manage payment of periodic maintenance fees  renewal fees  annuity fees and various other patent and application fees 
the united states patent and trademark office  or the uspto  and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural  documentary  fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process 
there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application  resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction 
if this occurs  our competitors might be able to enter the market  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the legal systems of some countries  particularly developing countries  do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection  especially those relating to life sciences 
this could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights 
for example  many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties 
in addition  many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties  including government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  patents may provide limited or no benefit 
proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
accordingly  our efforts to protect our intellectual 
table of contents property rights in such countries may be inadequate 
in addition  changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the united states and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property 
we have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets  and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business 
we have registered our acelrx mark in class  pharmaceutical preparations for treating pain  pharmaceutical preparations for treating anxiety  and class  drug delivery systems  medical device  namely  a mechanical and electronic device used to administer medications  perform timed medication delivery  and to provide secure access to and delivery of medications  in the united states 
our acelrx mark has also been registered in the european community and in canada  and is pending in india 
we have registered our nanotab mark and have received a notice of allowance for our tagline  accelerate  innovate  alleviate in class  in the united states 
although we are not currently aware of any oppositions to or cancellations of our registered trademarks or pending applications  it is possible that one or more of the applications could be subject to opposition or cancellation after the marks are registered 
the registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements 
it is also possible that we have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets  and that there are names or symbols other than acelrx that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration  and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business 
opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile 
prior to our initial public offering  or ipo  in february  there was no public market for our common stock 
an active public trading market may not develop or  if developed  may not be sustained 
moreover  the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following adverse results or delays in clinical trials  inability to obtain additional funding  including funding necessary to complete the third arx phase clinical trial required to submit an nda  any delay in submitting an nda for any of our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the fda s filing or review of that nda  failure to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products  inability to obtain adequate product supply for our product candidates  or the inability to do so at acceptable prices  adverse regulatory decisions  introduction of new products  services or technologies by our competitors  failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public  failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community  the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public  legislatures  regulators and the investment community  announcements of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors  
table of contents disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies  additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel  significant lawsuits  including patent or stockholder litigation  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future  and trading volume of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
our common stock is thinly traded and in the future  may continue to be thinly traded  and our stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to sell their shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate such shares 
to date  we have a low volume of daily trades in our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
for example  the average daily trading volume in our common stock on the nasdaq global market during the fourth quarter of was approximately  shares per day 
our stockholders may be unable to sell their common stock at or above their respective purchase prices if at all  which may result in substantial losses to our stockholders 
the market for our common shares may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers  and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future 
as noted above  our common shares may be sporadically and or thinly traded 
as a consequence of this lack of liquidity  the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction 
the price for our shares could  for example  decline significantly in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand  as compared to a seasoned issuer that could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price 
our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval 
our executive officers and directors  together with the stockholders with whom our executive officers and directors are affiliated or associated  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting stock as of december  therefore  these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position 
these stockholders are able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval 
for example  these stockholders  acting together  are able to control elections of directors  amendments of our organizational documents  or approval of any merger  sale of assets  or other major corporate transaction 
this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 
we incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company  and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended  or the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market have imposed various requirements on public companies 
our management and 
table of contents other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives 
moreover  these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly 
for example  these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage 
as a public company  we are subject to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we are unable to comply with section in a timely manner  it may affect the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting 
assessing our staffing and training procedures to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process 
we plan to continue to assess our internal controls and procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters we identify 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with the year ending december   unless we qualify for an exemption as a non accelerated filer under the applicable sec rules and regulations 
we have been and will continue to be involved in a substantial effort to implement appropriate processes  document the system of internal control over key processes  assess their design  remediate any deficiencies identified and test their operation 
we cannot be certain at this time whether our measures to improve internal controls will be successful  that we will be able to successfully complete the procedures  certification and attestation requirements of section or that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
if we fail to comply with the requirements of section  it may affect the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting and negatively impact the quality of disclosure to our investors 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify and report a material weakness  it could adversely affect our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had million shares of common stock outstanding 
substantially all of our stockholders that held stock prior to our ipo were subject to lock up agreements with the underwriters of our ipo that restrict the stockholders ability to transfer shares of our common stock until august  upon the expiration of the lock up period  approximately million of the shares outstanding as of august  became eligible for sale in the public market  subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act 
in addition  shares issued or issuable upon exercise of options and warrants vested as of august  are also eligible for sale 
sales of stock by our existing stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act  subject to the lock up arrangement described above 
registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act  except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in rule under the securities act 
any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock  including pursuant to our equity incentive plans  could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall 
we expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
we may sell common stock  convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time 
if we sell common stock  convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction  investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales 
these sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders  and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders 
pursuant to our equity incentive plan  or the incentive plan  our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity based awards to our employees  directors and consultants 
the number of shares available for future grant under our incentive plan will automatically increase each year by of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of december of the prior calendar year  subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year 
currently  we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under our incentive plan each year 
if our board of directors elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant by the maximum amount each year  our stockholders may experience additional dilution  which could cause our stock price to fall 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years 
if we face such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change  generally defined as a greater than change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre change tax attributes such as research tax credits to offset its post change income may be limited 
we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership 
as a result  if we earn net taxable income  our ability to use our pre change net operating loss carryforwards to offset united states federal taxable income may be subject to limitations  which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock 
we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development  operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management 
some provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may have anti takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  
table of contents limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders  creating a staggered board of directors  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders 
further  other provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us

overview we are a development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of acute and breakthrough pain 
we were founded to solve the problems associated with post operative intravenous patient controlled analgesia  or iv pca 
although widely used  iv pca has been shown to cause harm to patients following surgery because of the side effects of morphine  the invasive iv route of delivery and the inherent potential for programming and delivery errors associated with the complexity of infusion pumps 
in march  we initiated the first of three phase clinical trials for our lead product candidate  the sufentanil nanotab pca system  or arx system  or arx the second phase trial  an open label active comparator study is expected to start in the second quarter of the final planned phase efficacy and safety study  a double blind  placebo controlled trial is expected to begin in the third quarter of we expect top line data from all three phase trials in late or early the arx system is designed to address the problems associated with iv pca by utilizing sufentanil  a high therapeutic index opioid  nanotabs  our proprietary  non invasive sublingual dosage form  and our novel handheld pca device that enables simple patient controlled delivery of nanotabs in the hospital setting and eliminates the risk of programming errors 
we have completed phase clinical development for two additional product candidates  the sufentanil nanotab btp management system  or arx  for the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain  or btp  and the sufentanil triazolam nanotab  or arx  designed to provide mild sedation  anxiety reduction and pain relief for patients undergoing painful procedures in a physician s office 
in may  we announced that the us army medical research and material command  or usamrmc  awarded us a million grant to support the development of a new product candidate  arx  a sufentanil nanotab for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain 
under the terms of the grant  the usamrmc will reimburse us for development  manufacturing and clinical expenses necessary to prepare for and complete the planned phase dose finding trial in a study of acute moderate to severe pain  and to prepare to enter phase development 
development of therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 

table of contents product development arx we continue to make progress in the development of our lead product candidate  arx planned activities include the following completion of the first of three phase clinical trials  a double blind  placebo controlled efficacy and safety study of post operative pain following open abdominal surgery  which was initiated in march  initiation and completion of our second planned phase clinical study  an open label active comparator study comparing arx to the current standard of care  iv pca morphine and  initiation  and planned completion in late or early  of our third planned phase clinical study  a double blind  placebo controlled efficacy and safety study of post operative pain following hip and knee replacement surgeries  subject to completion of the final planned summative human factors study 
arx we continue to make progress towards the initiation of our planned arx phase dose finding clinical trial 
in october  we filed an investigational new drug application for arx  our product candidate for management of moderate to severe acute pain  with the fda  and we plan to initiate the phase study in the second quarter of  contingent on approval from the usamrmc  with top line results anticipated in the second half of future development of arx and arx is contingent upon additional funding or establishing corporate partnerships 
financial overview we are a development stage company with a limited operating history 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily from the private placement of convertible preferred stock  proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo  and proceeds received from our debt financings 
from inception through december   we have received net proceeds of million from the sale of convertible preferred stock and million from our debt financings 
in february  we completed our ipo  pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share for an aggregate offering price of million 
as a result of the offering  we received net proceeds of million  after underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses totaling million 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement with hercules technology ii  lp and hercules technology growth capital  inc  collectively referred to as hercules  under which we may borrow up to million in two tranches of million each  represented by secured convertible term promissory notes 
we drew the first tranche of million upon the closing of the transaction on june  and the second tranche of million in december the interest rate is initially  with months of interest only payments 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the first tranche to repay the remaining obligations under that certain loan and security agreement between us and pinnacle ventures  llc  or pinnacle  dated september since our inception in july  we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products and do not anticipate generating any product revenues for the foreseeable future 
we have recognized revenue associated with our grant from the usamrmc of million since inception of the grant  but continued funding from the usamrmc is contingent upon their review and approval of our continued research and development activities 
table of contents associated with the grant 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive other research related grant awards or produce other collaborative agreement revenues in the future 
we have incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception 
our net losses were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million compared to million as of december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  stock based compensation expenses  laboratory supplies  pre clinical and clinical studies  manufacturing expenses  allocated facilities expenses and subcontracted research and development expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase as we focus on the development of our product candidates 
additionally  in order to develop our product candidates as commercially viable therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of pharmaceutical development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expenses  professional fees  allocated facilities expenses  patent prosecution expenses and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our product candidates we expect the business aspects of the our company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturation of our business 
critical accounting estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in may  we entered into an award contract with the us army medical research and material command  or usamrmc  to support the development of the company s new product candidate  arx  a sufentanil nanotab for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain 
the grant provides for the reimbursement of qualified expenses for research and development activities as defined under the terms of the grant agreement 
revenue under the grant agreement is recognized when the related qualified research expenses are incurred 
research and development expenses we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of direct and research related allocated overhead costs such as facilities costs  salaries and related personnel costs  and material and supply costs 
in addition  research and development expenses include costs related to clinical trials to validate our testing processes and procedures and related overhead expenses 
expenses 
table of contents resulting from clinical trials are recorded when incurred based in part on factors such as estimates of work performed  patient enrollment  progress of patient studies and other events 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee share purchase plan  or espp  on estimated fair values 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award using a straight line method 
to estimate the value of an award  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires inputs such as expected life  expected volatility and risk free interest rate 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
estimates of expected life are primarily determined using the simplified method in accordance with guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
volatility is derived from historical volatilities of several public companies within our industry that are deemed to be comparable to our business because we have limited information on the volatility of our common stock since we had no trading history prior to completion of our ipo in february the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life assumption 
we review our valuation assumptions quarterly and  as a result  it is likely we will change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
further  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in determining the fair value of stock based awards  the stock based compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
prior to the ipo  we were also required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock based awards when performing the fair value calculations with the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair values of the common stock underlying our stock based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors  with input from management 
in valuing our common stock  our board of directors determined the equity value of our business by taking a weighted combination of the value indications under two valuation approaches  an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach estimates the present value of future estimated cash flows  based upon forecasted revenue and costs 
these future cash flows were discounted to their present values using a discount rate derived from an analysis of the cost of capital of comparable publicly traded companies in our industry or similar lines of business as of each valuation date and was adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows 
the market approach estimated the fair value by applying market multiples of comparable publicly traded companies in our industry or similar lines of business which were based on key metrics implied by the enterprise values or acquisition values of our comparable publicly traded companies 
liability associated with warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock were classified as liabilities on our balance sheets at fair value because the warrants could have conditionally obligated us to redeem the underlying convertible preferred stock 
the warrants were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date  and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of other income expense  net  in the statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
we used assumptions to estimate the fair value of the warrants including the remaining contractual terms of the warrants  risk free interest rates  expected dividend yields and the fair value and expected volatility of the underlying stock 
these assumptions were subjective and the fair value of the warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock could have differed significantly had we used different assumptions 

table of contents upon the completion of our ipo in february  all of our warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock had been exercised or converted into warrants to purchase common stock 
at that time  the then current aggregate fair value of these warrants was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital and we will no longer remeasure the liability associated with these warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock to fair value 
bridge loan on september   we entered into a bridge loan financing  in which we issued notes to certain existing investors for an aggregate purchase price of million  or the notes 
the notes could not be prepaid without the written consent of the holders of the notes  bore interest at a rate of per annum and had a maturity date of the earliest of september  or an event of default 
the principal and the interest under the notes were converted into common stock in connection with our ipo at a conversion price equal to of the ipo price  or per share 
under the terms of the bridge loan agreement  upon the election of the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount payable under the notes  we agreed to issue an additional million of the notes 
this additional million was determined to be a call option that was recorded at its fair value of million as a debt discount that was amortized to interest expense during the period when the notes were outstanding until conversion in connection with our ipo 
the fair value of the call option was determined by evaluating multiple potential outcomes using a market approach and an income approach depending on the scenario and discounted these values back to december  while applying estimated probabilities to each scenario value 
as of december   these scenarios included a potential ipo  merger or sale at different times during and as well as remaining private 
during the quarter ending march   the notes were amended so that the call option expired upon the closing of our ipo 
also in connection with the bridge loan financing  we issued warrants  or the warrants  with a fair value of million  which was recorded as a debt discount that was amortized to interest expense during the period where the warrants were outstanding until exercised at the time of the ipo as detailed above in liability associated with warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock 
we used considerable judgment in determining the fair value of these instruments and had we used different assumptions  the resulting fair values could have been materially different 
subsequent to december   and in conjunction with our ipo  the principal and accrued interest under the notes converted into  shares of common stock and the warrants were exercised on a net issuance basis for  shares of series c convertible preferred stock  which such shares of series c convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into  shares of common stock immediately prior to the closing of our ipo 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  any uncertain tax positions  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans 
as of december   and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  we have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
accordingly  there have not been significant changes to our provision or benefit for income taxes during the years ended december   or  and we do not expect any significant changes until we are no longer incurring losses 

table of contents as of december   and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million million and million  and state net operating loss carryforwards of million  million and million 
we also had million  million and million of federal research credit carryforwards  and million  million and million of state research credit carryforwards as of december   and realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in and the state net operating loss will begin expiring in under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change  generally defined as a greater than change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre change tax attributes such as research tax credits to offset its post change income may be limited 
reduction in work force on december   we announced a workforce reduction of approximately  or employees  a majority of whom were employed in product development and related support functions 
this decision was made based on the challenging economic conditions and a decline in forecasted research and development activities expected during the year ending december  as a result of this workforce reduction  we recorded a charge of  related to employee severance and other benefits which was included as operating expenses in the statement of operations during the year ended december  as of december   we had paid  for these employee severance and other termination benefits and had accrued the remaining  on the balance sheet 
during the year ended december   we paid the remaining  results of operations years ended december   and revenue to date  we have not generated any product revenue 
we do not expect to receive any revenues from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our products or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties 
in may  we received a grant award of million from the usamrmc for the development of arx  a sufentanil nanotab for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain 
revenue related to this grant award is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  and was generated from our grant with the usamrmc 
we did not generate any revenue for the years ended december  and research and development expenses conducting research and development is central to our business model 
the majority of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities related to arx  arx and arx research and development expenses included the following expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites  employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  payments to third party pharmaceutical and engineering development contractors  payments to third party manufacturers  and 
table of contents depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supply costs 
product candidates in late stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development  primarily due to the increased size and duration of late stage clinical trials 
we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to complete development of arx  execute activities associated with the clinical work related to arx and subsequently advance the development of arx and arx  provided that additional funding or corporate partnership resources are available to support the two latter programs 
we track external development expenses on a program by program basis 
our development resources are shared among all of our programs 
compensation and benefits  facilities  depreciation  stock based compensation  and development support services are not allocated specifically to projects and are considered research and development overhead 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses during the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  arx arx arx arx overhead total research and development expenses due to the inherently unpredictable nature of product development  development timelines and the probability of success  development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing arx and arx  and subsequently arx and arx  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate as well as ongoing assessments of the commercial potential of our product candidates 
in addition  we cannot predict which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations  when these arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree these arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
we expect our research and development expenses to substantially increase as we commence our planned arx phase clinical trials  and subject to additional funding  complete all the requisite preparatory activities to submit an nda to the fda 
additionally  our research and development expenses will increase as we initiate the planned arx phase clinical trial

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks primarily include risk related to interest rate sensitivities
