item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering  developing  manufacturing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases 
our two products are incivek telaprevir  which is approved in the united states and canada for the treatment of adults with genotype hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection  and kalydeco ivacaftor  which is approved in the united states for the treatment of patients six years of age or older with cystic fibrosis  or cf  who have a specific genetic mutation that is referred to as the gd mutation 
we began marketing incivek in the united states in may our collaborator  janssen pharmaceutica  nv  or janssen  began marketing telaprevir in its territories under the brand name incivo in september our collaborator  mitsubishi tanabe pharma corporation  or mitsubishi tanabe  obtained marketing approval for telaprevir from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare in september we began marketing kalydeco in the united states in january  and we expect to obtain approval to market ivacaftor in the european union later in we generated earnings as a cashflow positive company in the second half of after experiencing significant losses in  and the first half of in the second half of  we had net income attributable to us of million and our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by million 
we recognized net product revenues on sales of incivek of million and million  respectively  in the third and fourth quarters of we began recognizing royalty revenues from commercial sales of incivo by janssen in september  and we will begin to recognize revenues from sales of kalydeco in the first quarter of in order to maintain profitability and continue our strategic investment in research and development activities  we will need to continue to generate significant revenues in future periods 
we have ongoing clinical programs involving drug candidates intended for the treatment of hcv infection  cf  rheumatoid arthritis  epilepsy and influenza 
our hcv clinical programs are focused on developing all oral  interferon free combinations of hcv drugs and drug candidates that have the potential to further improve treatment options available to patients with hcv infection 
in our cf program  we are investigating the use of ivacaftor as a monotherapy in additional populations of patients with cf and combinations of ivacaftor and our other cf drug candidates  with the goal of expanding the group of patients with cf who can benefit from our medicines 
we believe that our longer term success will depend on our ability to continue to generate and develop innovative compounds for the treatment of serious diseases 
as a result  we expect to continue investing in research programs directed toward the identification of new drug candidates and to develop and commercialize selected drug candidates that emerge from those programs  alone or with third party collaborators 
commercialization and competition we believe that by focusing on serious diseases and innovative drugs that have the potential to provide significant advantages over existing therapies  we can increase the likelihood that our drug candidates  if approved  will be commercially successful 
our marketing efforts for incivek in the united states have focused on establishing an effective sales force and managed markets organization to promote incivek to health care providers and payors  implementing appropriate marketing  distribution and pricing strategies  and maintaining appropriate and sustained levels of incivek inventory 
we believe that initial sales of incivek have confirmed its commercially competitive profile  and to date a significant group of patients with genotype hcv infection have sought treatment with an incivek based treatment regimen 
we and janssen are competing with merck co  inc s victrelis boceprevir  another hcv protease inhibitor that was approved for sale in the united 
table of contents states and europe in in the united states  we believe over  patients were treated with incivek in we believe that sales of incivek will be subject to some seasonal fluctuations as  for example  historically fewer patients have started treatment for hcv infection during late november and december than during other periods of the year 
however  the sales of drugs that obtain initial market acceptance may decline for a variety of reasons  including increased competition from currently approved competitive drugs  the introduction of new competitive drugs  adverse information regarding the safety characteristics or efficacy of the drug or significant new information regarding potential future treatment regimens that are being evaluated in clinical trials 
we  along with a number of competitors  are pursuing development programs involving all oral combinations of hcv drugs and drug candidates with the goal of developing improved treatment regimens for hcv infection that could render the current treatments  which include the administration of pegylated interferon  or peg ifn  by injection  noncompetive 
in particular  each of bristol myers squibb company and gilead sciences  inc is actively pursuing all oral treatment regimens for hcv infection that would include an hcv nucleotide analogue and bristol myers squibb and medivir ab are evaluating a combination of an hcv protease inhibitor and an hcv nsa inhibitor 
to date  potential all oral treatment regimens have been evaluated in phase clinical trials involving relatively small numbers of patients 
however  we expect that one or more companies may begin registration programs evaluating potential all oral combination regimens for the treatment of genotype hcv infection in while the development and regulatory timelines for these drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change  we believe that substantial additional clinical data regarding these drug candidates and potential all oral treatment regimens will become available in and and that one or more all oral treatment regimens could enter the market as early as or kalydeco ivacaftor is a treatment for patients with cf six years of age or older who have a specific genetic mutation that is referred to as the gd mutation 
as with other marketed therapies for orphan diseases such as cf  we believe that we will be able to obtain adequate reimbursement for kalydeco in the united states 
in addition  we are focused on obtaining approval and adequate reimbursement for ivacaftor in europe and plan to seek approval for ivacaftor in a number of other countries  including canada and australia 
we believe that the number of patients with cf who have the gd mutation in the cftr gene is approximately  in the united states and  in europe 
we are planning to conduct three additional clinical trials to evaluate kalydeco as a monotherapy in additional patient populations  including patients younger than six years of age and patients with other mutations in the cftr gene 
these clinical trials are subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties as the clinical trials for our drug candidates 
even if these clinical trials are successful  we do not expect we would obtain approval for the use of kalydeco in additional populations until or later 
in addition to the factors described above  approved drugs continue to be subject to  among other things  numerous regulatory risks  post approval safety monitoring and risks related to supply chain disruptions 
as a result  it is difficult to predict future revenues that will be generated from sales by us of incivek and kalydeco and by janssen of incivo 
drug development discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take to years or more 
potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning efficacy  side effects  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product 
most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development  and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval 
because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable 
table of contents risks  we closely monitor the results of our discovery research  clinical trials and nonclinical studies  and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights  with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs as well as those of our competitors 
if we believe the data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate  we submit a new drug application to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the united states 
we also may seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions  such as a marketing authorization application in the european union 
to obtain approval  we must  among other things  demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities  processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease  and could delay  limit or deny regulatory approval 
if regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether  our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed 
drug supply we require a supply of incivek and kalydeco for sale in north america and will require a supply of ivacaftor for international sales if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval outside the united states 
we rely on an international network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our products and for supplies of compounds for clinical trials  and we expect that we will continue to rely on third parties to provide these manufacturing services for the foreseeable future 
third party contract manufacturers  including some in china  supply us with raw materials  and contract manufacturers in the european union and the united states convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form 
establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third party relationships 
although we believe we effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain  we do not have complete control over their activities 
also  while we believe we can effectively forecast demand for incivek  we have limited flexibility to adjust our supply in response to changes in demand  due to the significant lead times required to manufacture incivek 
regulatory compliance our marketing of pharmaceutical products  which began in may  is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations 
we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify  prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance 
among other laws  regulations and standards  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims statutes  and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved  or off label  uses 
anti kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit  offer  receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for  or to induce  the referral of business  including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting for payment to third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent  claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain  administer and expand these compliance programs globally

we sold our rights to these hiv royalties in for a one time cash payment of million 
collaborative revenues our collaborative revenues have fluctuated significantly on an annual basis 
this variability has been due to  among other things the achievement of significant milestone revenues in  the amendment of our collaboration agreement with mitsubishi tanabe  which provided for an up front payment that is being recognized over the expected period of performance under that contract  the amendment to our collaboration agreement with the cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated  or cfft  which began providing us additional research and development support in  and variable revenues we have received from services we provided to janssen and mitsubishi tanabe through our third party manufacturing network

royalty expenses in and primarily related to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of an hiv protease inhibitor sold by glaxosmithkline

we expect to continue to recognize this subroyalty as an expense in future periods 
research and development expenses comparison comparison increase increase increase increase in thousands in thousands  except percentages research expenses development expenses total research and development expenses our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates 
we do not assign our internal costs  such as salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and infrastructure costs  to individual drugs or drug candidates  because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs 
these internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs  such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical 
table of contents research organizations and other outsourced research  which we do allocate by individual program 
all research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred 
to date  we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
in addition  the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
over the three year period ended december   costs related to telaprevir have represented the largest portion of our development costs 
we expect to continue to incur development costs related to the conduct of additional clinical trials to support potential supplemental applications for telaprevir and ivacaftor 
our drug candidates are still in early and mid stage clinical development and  as a result  any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for these drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change 
we cannot make a meaningful estimate when  if ever  these drug candidates  including vx and those we in licensed from alios biopharma  inc  or alios  will generate revenues and cash flows

with the approval of incivek and kalydeco  we expect drug supply costs to decrease significantly in because we began capitalizing telaprevir drug supply costs in and expect to capitalize ivacaftor drug supply costs in our development expenses  excluding our drug supply costs  increased by million  or  in  as compared to and by million  or  in compared to  principally due to increases in headcount and the expansion of our development efforts as we completed the registration program for telaprevir and ivacaftor  prepared the regulatory filings needed to obtain approval for these products and continued the development of our other drug candidates

intangible asset impairment charge in  we recorded a million impairment charge related to vx  a non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitor that we acquired through our acquisition of virochem pharma inc  or virochem  in vx was a back up drug candidate for our non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitor vx based on  among other factors  the advancement of vx in and our consideration of potentially competitive drug candidates  we determined that the fair value of vx had become impaired 
in connection with this impairment charge  we recorded a credit of million in our provision for income taxes resulting in a net effect on our income related to this impairment charge of million in in  we recorded a million impairment charge related to another drug candidate we acquired through our acquisition of virochem

change in fair value of derivative instruments in  and  we recorded losses of million  million and million  respectively  in connection with the embedded and free standing derivatives associated with two financial transactions that we entered into in september related to million in contingent milestone payments that were earned by us from janssen in the losses were principally due to adjustments we made in estimates regarding the timing and probability of achieving the milestones pursuant to our collaboration agreement with janssen 
in  the contingent milestone payments that were the subject of the financial transactions were earned in full  and we will not incur any further charges related to the september financial transactions in future periods 
loss on exchanges of convertible senior subordinated notes in  we incurred non cash charges of million in connection with the exchanges of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due  or notes  for million newly issued shares of our common stock 
the charges were based 
table of contents on the value of the additional  shares of common stock that we issued in excess of the number of shares of common stock into which such notes were convertible prior to the exchanges 
there were no corresponding expenses in or provision for income taxes in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million 
this provision for income taxes was due to a provision of million for income taxes payable by alios and a provision of million for state taxes  partially offset by a benefit from income taxes of million due to a tax benefit resulting from the impairment of vx the provision of million for income taxes payable by alios reduces net income attributable to noncontrolling interest alios by a corresponding amount and as a result has no effect on the net income attributable to vertex 
noncontrolling interest alios the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest alios recorded on our consolidated statements of operations reflects alios net income for the reporting period  excluding revenues related to the up front payment and milestone payments earned by alios and adjusted for any changes during the reporting period in the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments payable by us to alios 
a summary of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest alios in is as follows in thousands loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes change in fair value of contingent milestone and royalty payments net income attributable to noncontrolling interest alios the million change in fair value of contingent milestone and royalty payments in results in a corresponding reduction in net income attributable to vertex for the provision for income taxes of million in attributable to noncontrolling interest alios corresponds to a provision for income taxes payable by alios on revenues from us included as part of the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of operations and has no net effect on net income attributable to vertex 
if we are able to successfully advance one or more of the hcv nucleotide analogues we licensed from alios into mid stage and late stage clinical development  we believe the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments will continue to increase  which will reduce net income attributable to vertex 
liquidity and capital resources we began operating as a cashflow positive company in the second half of as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  excluding alios cash and cash equivalents  of million  which was an increase of million from million as of june  this increase was primarily due to cash receipts from incivek sales partially offset by cash expenditures we made in the second half of related to  among other things  research and development expenses and sales  general and administrative expenses 
in order to continue to operate as a cashflow positive company and to continue our strategic investment in research and development activities  we will need to continue to generate significant revenues in future periods

in  we received million in cash from issuances of common stock pursuant to employee benefit plans 
sources of liquidity prior to  we financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that included research and or development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  strategic sales of assets or businesses  financial transactions  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans 
in future periods  we intend to rely on cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity and cash flows from royalties as a secondary source of liquidity 
we may seek to borrow funds to finance our working capital needs if such financing is available to us 
our existing million credit facility  which terminates on july   is initially unsecured  but is subject to a number of affirmative and negative covenants  including a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of more than million in domestic accounts 
if we breach any of these covenants and it results in an event of default  upon the event of default the lender would obtain a security interest in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities having a margined value of million  which would be transferred to an account controlled by the lender 
to date  we have not utilized any funds available to us pursuant to this credit facility 
future capital requirements we are incurring substantial expenses to commercialize incivek and kalydeco  while at the same time continuing diversified research and development efforts for our drug candidates 
in addition to funding our operating expenses  we have outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  and we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on april and october of each year 
the notes will mature on october  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at a price equal to approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
in addition  we have substantial lease obligations that will continue through in the second half of  our cash flows from sales of incivek exceeded our operating expenses  and we expect our cash flows from incivek incivo and kalydeco together with our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amounts of future revenues generated by incivek incivo and kalydeco  and the number  breadth  cost and prospects of our discovery and development programs 
financing strategy although we do not have any plans to do so in the near term  we may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities  securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing 
as part of our strategy for managing our capital structure  we have from time to time adjusted the amount and maturity of our debt obligations through new issues  privately negotiated transactions and market purchases  depending on market conditions and our perceived 
table of contents needs at the time 
we expect to continue pursuing a general financial strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional transactions with respect to our outstanding debt obligations  and the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
we will continue to manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
any capital transaction related to our outstanding debt obligations may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

revenue recognition product revenues  net in  we began generating revenues in the united states from sales of incivek 
we sell incivek principally to a limited number of major wholesalers  as well as selected regional wholesalers and specialty pharmacy providers  collectively our distributors  who subsequently resell incivek to patients and health care providers 
separately  we have arrangements with numerous third party payors that provide for government mandated and privately negotiated rebates  chargebacks and discounts 
we recognize net product revenues from sales of incivek upon delivery to our distributors as long as there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between us and our distributor  collectability is reasonably assured  and the price is fixed or determinable 
we have written contracts with our distributors and delivery occurs when a distributor receives incivek 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of each of our distributors and have determined that all of our material distributors are creditworthy 
in order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable  we must be able to calculate our gross product revenues from our distributors and reasonably estimate our net product revenues 
our gross product revenues are based on the fixed wholesale acquisition cost for incivek that we charge our distributors 
we estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our gross product revenues i trade allowances  such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and distributor fees  ii estimated government and private payor rebates  chargebacks and discounts  such as medicaid reimbursements  iii reserves for expected product returns and iv estimated costs of incentives offered to certain indirect customers including patients 
these estimates  and in particular the estimates for rebates  chargebacks and discounts and expected product returns  require us to make significant judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenues on sales of incivek 

table of contents the value of the rebates  chargebacks and discounts provided to third party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third party payors 
typically  government mandated discounts are significantly larger than discounts provided to other third party payors 
in order to estimate our total rebates  chargebacks and discounts  we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third party payor  which is referred to as the payor mix 
we track available information regarding changes  if any  to the payor mix for incivek  to our contractual terms with third party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of incivek in the distribution channel 
if necessary  we will adjust our estimated rebates  chargebacks and discounts based on new information  including information regarding actual rebates  chargebacks and discounts for incivek  as it becomes available 
if we increased our estimate of the percentage of patients receiving incivek covered by third party payors entitled to government mandated discounts by two percentage points  our net product revenues would decrease by less than for the three months ended december  our distributors have the right to return unopened incivek that has not been prescribed beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending twelve months after the labeled expiration date 
the expiration date for incivek is two years after it has been converted into tablet form  which is the last step in the manufacturing process for incivek and generally occurs within a few months before incivek is delivered to distributors 
as of december   we have not received any material product returns 
based on our specialty distribution model with sales to a limited number of distributors  data provided to us by our distributors  including weekly reporting of distributor sales and inventory levels  and by other third parties  historical industry information regarding return rates for similar specialty pharmaceutical products  the estimated remaining shelf life of incivek previously shipped and currently being shipped  and contractual agreements with our distributors  which include provisions designed to limit the amount of inventory they maintain  we have estimated that product returns for incivek sold to distributors in will be less than of net sales 
we track actual returns by individual production lots and will continue to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel 
if necessary  we will adjust our estimated product returns based on new information as it becomes available 
up front license fees we recognize revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees related to collaboration agreements  including the million we received from janssen in and the million we received from mitsubishi tanabe in  on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
the period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and or development is expected to occur or manufacturing services are expected to be provided 
when the period of performance is based on the period over which research and or development is expected to occur  we are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines 
because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  these estimates regarding the period of performance have changed in the past and may change in the future 
our estimates regarding the period of performance under the janssen collaboration agreement were adjusted in  and  as a result of changes in the global development plan for telaprevir 
these adjustments were made on a prospective basis beginning in the periods in which the changes were identified and resulted in decreases in the amount of revenues we recognized on a quarterly basis from the janssen collaboration 
milestone payments at the inception of each agreement that includes contingent milestone payments payable to us  we evaluate whether the contingencies underlying each milestone event are substantive  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone event  as well as the level of successful effort and investment required 
if we do not consider a 
table of contents milestone event to be substantive  the revenues from the related milestone payment will be recognized over the period of performance 
where a substantive milestone event is achieved in a collaboration arrangement and the corresponding payment is reasonably assured  we recognize the payment as earned 
because achievement of a substantive milestone event under a collaboration agreement typically requires the completion of a number of activities conducted over a significant period of time  the expenses related to achieving the milestone event often are incurred prior to the period in which the milestone payment is recognized 
the milestone events that we achieved under our janssen collaboration agreement in that resulted in million in revenues were considered substantive and the revenues related to each milestone event were recognized in the quarter in which the corresponding payment became reasonably assured 
royalty revenues royalty revenues for incivo are recognized based on net sales of incivo as reported to us by janssen and are recognized in the period the sales occur 
because net sales as reported by janssen could include certain estimates  we could experience future adjustments to royalty revenues and the adjustments could be significant 
business transactions business combinations in march  we acquired virochem for million in cash and common stock with a fair market value of million 
we assigned the value of the consideration transferred to acquire the business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
this goodwill related to the potential synergies from the possible development of combination therapies involving telaprevir and the acquired drug candidates 
the allocations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date included million of intangible assets related to in process research and development and a million deferred tax liability 
the intangible assets acquired were in process research and development assets relating to two drug candidates being developed by virochem  vx and vx vx and vx had estimated fair values on the acquisition date of million and million  respectively 
we have tested the fair value of vx on an annual basis since the acquisition date and no impairment has been identified 
in connection with preparing our quarterly report for the period ended september   we identified certain factors that were considered impairment indicators related to vx we determined that the fair value of vx was zero dollars  based on the advancement of vx in the third quarter of  our consideration of potentially competitive drug candidates and the other factors described in note c  acquisition of viro chem pharma  inc  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this determination resulted in a million impairment charge in the third quarter of in connection with this impairment charge  we also recorded an adjustment of million to our deferred tax liability 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included the following related to the virochem acquisition million of intangible assets related to vx and a million deferred tax liability 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets such as in process research and development  using a variety of methods  including present value models that are based upon multiple probability weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the acquired drug candidates 
the present value models require us to make significant assumptions regarding the estimates that market participants would make in evaluating a drug candidate  including 
table of contents the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug candidate  the timing of and the expected costs to complete in process research and development projects  future cash flows from potential drug sales  which are based on estimates of the sales price of the drug  the number of patients that will be diagnosed and treated and our competitive position in the marketplace  and appropriate discount rates 
the estimated fair value ascribed to vx and vx on the acquisition date was based on the estimated fair value that would be ascribed to each of these drug candidates by a market participant that acquired both drug candidates in a single transaction 
the assumed probability of advancing vx and vx through various phases of development reflected the understanding among market participants that most drug candidates that enter phase clinical trials are not ultimately approved for commercial sale 
while  on the date of acquisition  vx and vx were each at a similar stage of development  we attributed a significantly higher value to vx than to vx because the clinical and nonclinical data from the vx program was significantly more promising than the clinical and nonclinical data from the vx program 
in addition  the fair value estimate incorporated our determination that a market participant would not be likely to continue development of vx unless future data from clinical trials or nonclinical studies of vx resulted in a delay or discontinuation of the vx development program 
projections of the duration and cost of nonclinical studies and clinical trials vary significantly over the life of a project depending on developments in the program over time  but in order to estimate the fair market value on the acquisition date we made the following assumptions from the perspective of market participants regarding the potential timing and costs to develop vx and or vx we assumed if a drug candidate were successfully developed in the united states it would take approximately five to nine years from the date of the acquisition in order to obtain marketing approval 
in addition  for the valuation  we assumed an estimate of cost from acquisition to launch to develop a drug candidate that was within a range of million to million 
future cash flows  if any  would not be generated until a drug candidate completed all required phases of clinical trials and obtained regulatory approval 
the risk adjusted discount rate for each of these projects was approximately 
virochem s in process research and development assets were recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets 
we maintain these assets on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired 
if we complete a project  we will amortize the carrying value of the related intangible asset as part of cost of product revenues over the remaining estimated life of the asset 
if we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project  we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and take an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs 
in order to complete an acquired research and development project  the related drug candidate must be evaluated in later stage clinical trials  which are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of pharmaceutical products 
in  we expect to obtain data from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating telaprevir vx based combination therapy 
in addition  while the development and regulatory timelines for vx and drug candidates being developed by our competitors are highly subjective and subject to change  we believe that substantial additional clinical data regarding these drug candidates and potential all oral treatment regimens will become available in and and that one or more all oral treatment regimens could enter the market as early as or if the fair value of vx becomes impaired as the result of unfavorable safety or efficacy data from any ongoing or future clinical trial or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing vx  we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
we test the virochem intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october  and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist 
events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding our drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate  changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate or new information 
table of contents regarding potential sales prices for the drug 
in connection with each annual impairment assessment and any interim impairment assessment  we compare the fair value of the asset as of the date of the assessment with the carrying value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the virochem intangible assets were estimated using the probability weighted present value models described above  utilizing updated assumptions and estimates regarding the status of the development programs for the drug candidates  the potential future cash flows from sales of drugs  and appropriate discount rates 
variable interest entity and collaborative arrangements alios biopharma  inc in june  we entered into an agreement with alios pursuant to which we agreed to collaborate on the research  development and commercialization of als and als  two hcv nucleotide analogues discovered by alios 
we are responsible for all expenses related to the development and commercialization of the compounds and provide research funding to alios 
we paid alios a million up front payment  and alios is eligible to receive research and development milestone payments  commercial milestone payments and tiered royalties on net sales of any approved drugs licensed by us under the collaboration agreement 
our interests in alios are limited to those accorded to us pursuant to our collaboration agreement with alios  and we have no equity interest  or right to acquire any equity interest  in alios 
in addition to alios activities related to hcv nucleotide analogues  alios is engaged in separate programs directed at developing novel drugs 
our collaboration with alios requires us to apply accounting policies that involve significant judgments and that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
under applicable accounting guidance  as a result of the relationship established through the collaboration agreement  alios is deemed to be a variable interest entity  or vie 
because we acquired an exclusive license to certain intellectual property belonging to the vie  and based on the significance of the two licensed compounds to alios taken as a whole  the collaboration is treated for accounting purposes as if we have acquired an interest in the entire vie 
in the alios collaboration  where a through the joint steering committee  we have the power to direct the development and commercialization of the two licensed compounds  which are the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of alios  b we are required to fund research and development activities related to the licensed assets and c we are entitled to receive a majority of the potential revenues from sales of drugs developed pursuant to the collaboration  we are deemed under accounting guidance to be the primary beneficiary of a vie that is a business 
as a result  we are required to consolidate alios financial statements into our financial statements 
we believe that the following effects of the consolidation on our consolidated financial statements are the most significant in each period  we record net income loss attributable to the alios noncontrolling interest 
this net income loss reflects alios net income loss for the period as adjusted for gains and losses in the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments payable by us to alios 
determining the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments payable by us to alios requires us to make significant estimates regarding the probability and potential timing of achieving each of the milestones pursuant to the agreement  future potential net sales of hcv nucleotide analogues licensed from alios and appropriate discount rates 
we expect that the net income loss attributed to noncontrolling interest alios will continue to be affected by changes in the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments 
for example  in we advanced both of alios hcv nucleotide analogues into clinical development and the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments increased by million due to increases in the likelihood of achieving milestones and obtaining regulatory approvals  together with decreases in the time period over which we are discounting potential milestone and royalty 
table of contents payments 
increases in the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments in resulted in a significant decrease in net income attributable to vertex in we recorded million of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet based on our estimate of the fair value of alios in process research and development assets as of the transaction date and made significant estimates regarding the probability of obtaining regulatory approval of an hcv nucleotide analogue  the timing and expected costs of clinical trials and other development activities  future potential cash flows from sales of drugs and the appropriate discount rates 
if we are successful in developing one or more hcv nucleotide analogues  we will amortize the carrying value of the intangible asset as part of cost of product revenues 
we test these in process research and development assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october  and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
if the fair value of alios hcv nucleotide analogue program becomes impaired as the result of safety or efficacy data from any ongoing or future clinical trial conducted by us or our competitors or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing the hcv nucleotide analogues we license from alios  we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
we determined the fair value of these in process research and development assets using probability weighted present value models 
since the effective date of the collaboration we have consolidated all of alios expenses and revenues into our consolidated statements of operations  eliminating all intercompany balances and transactions 
in  alios operating expenses were immaterial to our consolidated statements of operations 
in future periods  if alios increases its headcount and or expands its activities related to its other programs  its operating expenses could increase substantially 
to the extent that alios pursues other programs  we expect that expenses of alios related to those activities would be reflected in our research and development expenses and our sales  general and administrative expenses as a result of the financial statement consolidation 
we would not be entitled to any benefits from those activities 
we reflect all of alios cash and cash equivalents as restricted cash and cash equivalents alios when we consolidate alios balance sheet 
we do not have any rights to alios cash or cash equivalents  these resources are not available to fund research and development programs pursuant to the collaboration and these amounts do not provide us with any additional liquidity 
as a result of payments we made to alios in  alios had significant liquid assets as of december  alios has control over the restricted cash and cash equivalents alios  including the ability to distribute the restricted cash and cash equivalents to alios equityholders  and as a result this asset  although carried on our consolidated balance sheet  is not included in the discussion of our liquidity and should be disregarded when evaluating our financial condition 
research and development expenses all research and development expenses  including amounts funded through research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  contractual services  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  expenses associated with drug supplies that are not being capitalized  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
when third party service providers billing terms do not coincide with our period end  we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  contractual services costs and costs for drug supply  incurred in a 
table of contents given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
commercial supplies we capitalize inventories produced in preparation for potentially initiating sales of a drug candidate when the drug candidate is considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the costs to manufacture the drug candidate are expected to be recoverable through sales of the drug 
in determining whether or not to capitalize such inventories  we evaluate  among other factors  information regarding the drug candidate s safety and efficacy  the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales  including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement 
in addition  we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the drug candidate and the remaining shelf life of the inventories 
after we begin capitalizing inventories  we continue to monitor these factors and  if there are significant negative developments regarding the drug candidate  we could be required to impair previously capitalized costs 
we began capitalizing the costs of our incivek inventories on january  because we expensed most of the manufacturing costs related to initial quantities of incivek as research and development expenses in prior periods  our initial cost of product revenues for incivek was low and will increase in future periods 
derivative instruments and embedded derivatives september financial transactions expenses related to two financial transactions that we entered into in september resulted in million  million and million  respectively  in expenses in  and the two financial transactions related to million of milestone payments that were earned by us from janssen in in connection with the regulatory filing  approval and launch of incivo in the european union 
in the first financial transaction  we issued secured notes due  or notes  which had a face value of million and did not carry an explicit interest rate  for million in cash 
the notes were payable in october  subject to earlier redemption and were secured by million of contingent milestone payments 
the notes were redeemed in full in upon the receipt of the corresponding janssen milestone payments 
in the second transaction  we sold million in contingent milestone payments for a cash payment of million 
the notes contained an embedded derivative related to their potential early repayment or redemption 
the separate sale of the million in contingent milestone payments was accounted for as a free standing derivative instrument 
in order to account for the notes and the sale of the rights to the million in milestone payments  we estimated the fair value of the derivative embedded in the notes and of the free standing derivative 
the models we used to estimate these fair values required  among other things  estimates regarding the timing and probability of achieving the milestone events and the appropriate discount rates 
as these milestones were achieved and we and janssen obtained additional data from the telaprevir registration program  we updated these assumptions to reflect the increasing probability of achieving these milestone events and the expected timing of such events and recorded corresponding expenses or gains in each quarterly period 
while the total amount of the expenses related to these two financial transactions was fixed at million  plus the initial transaction expenses  provided that the milestones were achieved prior to october  the timing of these expenses in  and was dependent on the estimates and assumptions incorporated in the models used to estimate the fair values of the embedded and free standing derivatives at the end of each fiscal quarter 

table of contents stock based compensation expense we measure the compensation cost of stock based compensation at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  including estimated forfeitures  and we recognize that cost as an expense ratably over the associated employee service period  which generally is the vesting period of the equity award  or the derived service period for awards with market conditions 
for our awards with performance conditions  we make estimates regarding the likelihood of satisfaction of the performance condition that affect the period over which the expense is recognized 
we calculate the fair value of stock options and shares purchased pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates concerning our stock price volatility  the rate of return of risk free investments  the expected term of the awards  and our anticipated dividends 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we also are required to exercise judgment to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  if any of our estimates or assumptions prove incorrect  or if the likelihood of achievement of a performance condition changes  our results could be materially affected 
income taxes despite beginning to operate as a profitable and cashflow positive company in the second half of  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets because we have an extended history of annual losses 
our us federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately billion as of december  on a quarterly basis  we reassess the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets 
we would consider reversing a significant portion of the valuation reserve upon assessment of certain factors  including i a demonstration of sustained profitability  and ii the support of internal financial forecasts demonstrating the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
if we determine that the reversal of all or a portion of the valuation reserves is appropriate  a significant benefit could be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of the reversal 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note a  nature of business and accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the united states government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and commercial paper  and money market funds 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and we have implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of our investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 

table of contents foreign exchange market risk as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  swiss franc  british pound and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
the current exposures arise primarily from cash  accounts receivable  intercompany receivables and payables  and calculations of royalties receivable from net sales denominated in foreign currencies 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
we are considering a foreign currency management program with the objective of reducing the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues
