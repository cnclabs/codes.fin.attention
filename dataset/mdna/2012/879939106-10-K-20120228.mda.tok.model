the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
our market opportunity we market our customer experience solutions primarily to global clients in g countries which represent of the world s largest economies  together with the european union  and perform the majority of our services from strategically located customer experience delivery centers around the globe 
many of our clients choose a blended strategy whereby they outsource work with us in multiple geographic locations and may also utilize our work from home offering 
we believe our ability to offer one of the most geographically diverse footprints improves service flexibility while reducing operational and delivery risk in the event of a service interruption at any one location 
our solutions are designed to address the rapidly changing profile of the customer 
digital interactions  including text  web  chat  self service and social media  are increasingly outpacing the volume of voice and email transactions 
while of customer inquiries were handled by phone or email just five years ago  today more than of inquiries are coming through self help and community channels 
at the same time  customer expectations are also rising 
a recent survey showed that of consumers expect a response from a company online within one hour 
we believe these trends are placing the customer experience at the forefront of business leaders agendas as a critical path to growth and differentiation and driving increased demand for our solutions 
our technology enabled solutions seamlessly integrate mobile devices  self service and human assisted channels while embedding data driven customer insights to optimize and personalize the customer experience for our clients 
industry studies indicate that companies with high quality customer experience levels tend to grow faster and more profitably and typically enjoy premium pricing and market valuations in their industry 
given this strong correlation between customer satisfaction and improved profitability  we believe that more companies are increasingly focused on selecting partners  such as teletech  that can deliver strategic solutions across a continuum of capabilities that are designed to grow revenue and optimize the customer experience versus merely reduce costs 
we believe that our revenue will grow over the long term as global demand for our services is fueled by the following trends increased focus on the customer experience 
given the strong correlation between customer satisfaction and improved profitability  we believe that more companies are increasingly focused on selecting outsourcing partners  such as teletech  that can deliver strategic solutions across a continuum of capabilities that are designed to grow revenue and optimize the customer experience versus merely reduce costs 
focus on partners who can offer multi channel  technology rich customer experience solutions 
the rapidly changing profile of the customer and rising customer expectations are driving increased demand for personalized and seamlessly integrated multi channel solutions that incorporate mobile devices  self service and human assisted channels while embedding data driven customer insights 
focus on partners who can offer fully integrated revenue generation solutions 
a focus on partners who can offer fully integrated revenue generation solutions to maximize the revenue and profitability potential of each customer  improve customer acquisition  retention and growth and target new or underpenetrated markets 
integration of front and back office business processes to provide increased operating efficiencies and an enhanced customer experience especially in light of the weakening global economic environment 
companies have realized that integrated business processes reduce operating costs and allow customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently resulting in higher customer satisfaction and brand loyalty thereby improving their competitive position 
a majority of our historic revenue has been derived from providing customer facing front office solutions to our clients 
given that our global delivery centers are also fully capable of providing back office solutions  we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue by winning more back office opportunities and providing the services during non peak hours with minimal incremental investment 
furthermore  by spreading our fixed costs across a larger revenue base and increasing our asset utilization  we expect our profitability to improve over time 
increasing percentage of company operations being outsourced to most capable third party partners 
having experienced success with outsourcing a portion of their business processes  companies are increasingly inclined to outsource a larger percentage of this work 
we believe companies will continue to consolidate their business processes with third party partners  such as teletech  who are financially stable and able to invest in their business while also demonstrating an extensive global operating history and an ability to cost effectively scale to meet their evolving needs 
increasing adoption of outsourcing across broader groups of industries 
early adopters of the business process outsourcing trend  such as the media and communications industries  are being joined by companies in other industries  including healthcare  retail and financial services 
these companies are beginning to adopt outsourcing to improve their business processes and competitiveness 
for example  we see increasing interest in our services from companies in the healthcare  retail and financial services industries 
we believe the number of other industries that will adopt or increase their level of outsourcing will continue to grow  further enabling us to increase and diversify our revenue and client base 
focus on speed to market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations 
as companies broaden their product offerings and seek to enter new emerging markets  they are looking for outsourcing partners that can provide speed to market while reducing their capital and operating risk 
to achieve these benefits  companies are seeking bpo partners with an extensive operating history  an established global footprint  the financial strength to invest in innovation to deliver more strategic capabilities and the ability to scale and meet customer demands quickly 
given our financial stability  geographic presence in countries and our significant investment in standardized technology and processes  we believe that clients select teletech because we can quickly ramp large  complex business processes around the globe in a short period of time while assuring a high quality experience for their customers 
our competitive strengths entering a business services outsourcing relationship is typically a long term strategic commitment for companies 
the outsourced processes are usually complex and require a high degree of customization and integration with a client s core operations 
accordingly  our clients tend to enter long term contracts which provide us with a more predictable revenue stream 
in addition  for many of our clients we provide services for multiple of their unique programs across their many lines of business 
we do provide certain client programs on a short term basis 
we have high levels of client retention due to our operational excellence and ability to meet our clients customer experience management objectives  as well as the significant transition costs required by our client to exit the relationship 
our client retention was in and in  excluding the completion of the short term government programs 
we believe that our clients select us due to our end to end suite of customer experience solutions  spanning strategic professional consulting  revenue generation  front and back office business process outsourcing  fully hosted or managed technology and learning innovation services 
ability to deliver multi channel  technology rich customer experience solutions to meet the demands of the rapidly changing profile of the customer and rising customer expectations 
industry reputation and our position as one of the largest and most financially sound industry partners with years of expertise in delivering complex customer experience management across targeted industries  ability to scale infrastructure and employees worldwide using globally deployed best practices to ensure a consistent  high quality service  ability to optimize the performance of our workforce through proprietary hiring  training and performance optimization tools  and commitment to continued product and services innovation to further diversify our revenue and enhance the strategic capabilities of our clients 
as the complexity and technology required to deliver an exceptional customer experience increases  we continue to develop other innovative services that leverage our investment in a centralized and standardized delivery platform to meet our clients needs  and we believe that these solutions will represent a growing percentage of our future revenue 
these investments include our acquisition of a majority interest in peppers rogers group to further enhance our professional services capabilities and our acquisition of eloyalty to enhance our systems integration and telephony and technology offerings 
in addition  we have begun to offer cloud based hosted services where clients can license any aspect of our global network and proprietary applications 
while the revenue from these offerings is small relative to our consolidated revenue  we believe it will continue to grow as these services become more widely adopted by our clients 
we aim to further improve our competitive position by investing in a growing suite of new and innovative customer experience solutions across our targeted industries 
we believe that technological innovation  best operating practices and innovative human capital strategies that can scale globally are key elements to our continued industry leadership 
technological innovation we have measurably transformed our technology platform by moving to a secure  private  internet protocol ip based infrastructure 
this transformation has enabled us to centralize and standardize our worldwide delivery capabilities resulting in improved quality of delivery for our clients along with lower capital and information technology it operating costs 
the foundation of this platform is our four ip hosting centers known as teletech gigapops  which are located on three continents 
these centers provide a fully integrated suite of voice and data routing  workforce management  quality monitoring  business analytic and storage capabilities 
this enables anywhere to anywhere  real time processing of our clients business needs from any location around the globe 
this hub and spoke model enables us to provide our services at the lowest cost while increasing scalability  reliability  redundancy  asset utilization and the diversity of our service offerings 
to ensure high end to end security and reliability of this critical infrastructure  we monitor and manage the teletech gigapops x  days per year from several strategically located state of the art global command centers as well as providing redundant  fail over capabilities for each gigapop 
this platform is the foundation for new  innovative offerings including teletech ondemandtm  teletech home and our suite of human capital solutions 
our technology innovations have resulted in the filing of more than intellectual property patent applications 
globally deployed best operating practices globally deployed best operating practices assure that we can deliver a consistent  scalable  high quality experience to our clients customers from any of our delivery centers or work from home associates around the world 
standardized processes include our approach to attracting  screening  hiring  training  scheduling  evaluating  coaching and maximizing associate performance to meet our clients needs 
we provide real time reporting on performance across the globe to ensure consistency of delivery 
in addition  this information provides valuable insight into what is driving customer inquiries  enabling us to proactively recommend process changes to our clients to optimize their customers experience 
with delivery centers in countries  we believe this makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse providers of customer experience solutions 
we plan to selectively expand into other attractive delivery markets over time 
of the countries from which we provide customer experience solutions  provide services for onshore clients including the us  australia  brazil  china  england  germany  ghana  new zealand  northern ireland  scotland  south africa and spain 
the total number of workstations in these countries is  or of our total delivery capacity 
the other five countries provide services  partially or entirely  for offshore clients including argentina  canada  costa rica  mexico and the philippines 
the total number of workstations in these countries is  or of our total delivery capacity 
innovative human capital strategies to effectively manage and leverage our human capital requirements  we have developed a proprietary suite of business processes  software tools and client engagement guidelines that work together to improve performance for our clients while enabling us to reduce time to hire  decrease employee turnover and improve time to service and quality of performance 
the three primary components of our human capital platform talent acquisition  learning innovation services and performance optimization combine to form a powerful and flexible management system to streamline and standardize operations across our global delivery centers 
these three components work together to allow us to make better hires  improve training quality and provide real time feedback and incentives for performance 
our historical financial performance due to the global economic slowdown that began in late  our revenue declined from billion in to billion in primarily as a result of lower client volumes  elongated sales cycles  the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies from which we derive revenue  an increased pace of clients migrating certain work from onshore delivery centers to offshore delivery centers  and our decision to proactively rationalize certain underperforming businesses and geographies out of our portfolio 
despite this revenue decrease  we were able to maintain our operating margin from in to in this was achieved primarily as a result of our revenue diversification efforts into greater professional and technology based services that have a higher margin  aligning our capacity and workforce with the current business needs  increased utilization of our delivery centers across a hour period  leveraging our global purchasing power  and continued expansion of services provided from our geographically diverse delivery centers 
our future growth goals and strategy our business strategy to grow and diversify our revenue  increase profitability and strengthen our industry position includes the following elements capitalize on the favorable trends in the global outsourcing environment  which we believe will include more companies that want to modify their approach to outsourcing based on total value delivered versus the lowest priced provider  seek a partner that can deliver strategic consulting and operational execution around customer centric strategies  focus on partners who can offer fully integrated revenue generation solutions  address the growing complexity of managing multiple customer communication channels including voice  self service  email  chat and text  take advantage of cost efficiencies through the adoption of cloud based or managed technology solutions and consolidate outsourcing partners with those that have a solid financial position  adequate capital resources to sustain a long term relationship and globally diverse delivery capabilities across a broad range of solutions  deepen and broaden existing client relationships  continue to diversify revenue into higher margin offerings such as professional services  talent acquisition  learning innovation services and our managed technology offerings  win business with new clients and focus on end to end offerings in targeted industries  such as healthcare  retail and financial services  where we expect accelerating adoption of customer experience management  continue to invest in innovative proprietary technology and new business offerings  improve our operating margins through selected profit improvement initiatives  increase asset utilization of our globally diverse delivery centers by providing services during non peak hours with minimal incremental investment  scale our work from home offering to increase operational flexibility  and selectively pursue acquisitions that extend our capabilities  geographic reach and or industry expertise 
as we further develop and continue to scale our strategic business units  we are continually evaluating ways to maximize shareholder value  which may include the disposition of business units  in whole or in part  that could take the form of asset sales  mergers  sales of equity interests in our subsidiaries privately or through a public offering or the spin off of equity interests of our subsidiaries to our shareholders 
clients in  none of our clients exceeded of our total annual revenue 
our top five and ten clients represented and of total revenue in  respectively 
we have experienced long term relationships with our top five clients  ranging from five to years  with the majority of these clients having completed multiple contract renewals with us 
certain of our communications clients also provide us with telecommunication services through transactions that are negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
these clients currently represent approximately of our total annual revenue 
we believe each of these supplier contracts is negotiated on an arm s length basis and that the terms are substantially the same as those that have been negotiated with unrelated vendors 
expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than one percent of our total operating costs 
competition we compete primarily with the in house customer experience management operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide bpo services including accenture ltd  convergys corporation  genpact limited  sykes enterprises incorporated and teleperformance  among others 
we work with accenture ltd  computer sciences corporation and ibm on a sub contract basis and approximately of our total revenue is generated from relationships with these system integrators 
we compete primarily on the basis of our years of experience  our global locations  our quality and scope of services  our speed and flexibility of implementation  our technological expertise  and our total value delivered and contractual terms 
a number of competitors may have different capabilities and resources than ours 
additionally  niche providers or new entrants could capture a segment of the market by developing new systems or services that could impact our market potential 
seasonality historically  we experience a seasonal increase in revenue in the fourth quarter related to higher volumes from clients primarily in retail and other industries with seasonal businesses 
also  our operating margins in the first quarter are impacted by higher payroll related taxes predominantly in our us global workforce 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees in countries 
approximately of these employees held full time positions and were located outside of the us we have approximately  employees outside the us and canada covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in most cases  the collective bargaining agreements are mandated under national labor laws 
these collective bargaining agreements include employees in the following countries in argentina  approximately employees are covered by an industry wide collective bargaining agreement with the confederation of commerce employees that expires in april  in brazil  approximately  employees are covered by industry wide collective bargaining agreements with sintratel and sintelmark that expire in january  in mexico  we have approximately  employees covered by an industry wide collective bargaining agreement with the federacion obrero sindicalista that expires in january  in spain  we have approximately  employees covered by industry wide collective bargaining agreements with comfia ccoo and fes ugt that expired in december and are currently being renegotiated  and in australia  approximately employees are covered by a collective agreement adopted by teletech international  pty 
ltd 
under the provisions of the contract call centres award that expires in august we anticipate that these agreements will be renewed and that any renewals will not impact us in a manner materially different from all other companies covered by such industry wide agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees and unions are satisfactory 
we have not experienced any material work stoppages in our ongoing business 
intellectual property and proprietary technology our success is partially dependent upon certain proprietary technologies and core intellectual property 
we have a number of pending patent applications in the us and foreign countries 
our technology is also protected under copyright laws 
additionally  we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and proprietary information agreements to protect our proprietary technology 
we and our subsidiaries have trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries  including teletech  the teletech globe design  teletech gigapop  teletech global ventures  hirepoint  identify  identify plus  workbooth  total delivered value  your customer management partner  to  peppers and rogers group  eloyalty and the eloyalty design 
we believe that several of our trademarks are of material importance 
some of our proprietary technology is licensed to others under corresponding license agreements 
some of our technology is licensed from others 
while our competitive position could be affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property  we believe that we have generally taken commercially reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property

item a 
risk factors in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section  in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks that we face 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline 
risks relating to our business recent changes in us and global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our business our business is directly affected by the performance of our clients and general economic conditions 
recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the us and other regions of the world in which we do business 
there is evidence that this is affecting demand for some of our services 
in substantially all of our client programs  we generate revenue based  in large part  on the amount of time our employees devote to our clients customers 
consequently  the amount of revenue generated from any particular client program is dependent upon consumers interest in and use of our client s products and or services  which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
our clients may not be able to market or develop products and services that require their customers to use our services  especially as a result of the downturn in the us and worldwide economy 
furthermore  a decline in our clients business or performance  including possible client bankruptcies  could impair their ability to pay for our services 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if any of our major clients were unable or unwilling  for any reason  to pay for our services 
a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of our clients could cause a reduction in our revenue and operating results we rely on strategic  long term relationships with large  global companies in targeted industries 
as a result  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients 
our five largest clients collectively represented of revenue in and of revenue in our ten largest clients represented of revenue in and of revenue in we did not have a client that represented of our revenue in either or we believe that a substantial portion of our total revenue will continue to be derived from a relatively small number of our clients in the future 
the contracts with our ten largest clients expire between and we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that any contracts will be renewed or  if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
the volumes and profit margins of our most significant programs may decline and we may not be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate comparable revenue and profits 
the loss of all or part of a major client s business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
client consolidations could result in a loss of clients or contract concessions that would adversely affect our operating results we serve clients in targeted industries that have historically experienced a significant level of consolidation 
if one of our clients is acquired by another company including another one of our clients  provisions in certain of our contracts allow these clients to cancel or renegotiate their contracts  or to seek contract concessions 
such consolidations may result in the termination or phasing out of an existing client contract  volume discounts and other contract concessions that could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our concentration of business activities in certain geographic areas subjects us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition we have delivery centers in many countries  and some business activities may be concentrated in certain geographic areas  including the philippines and latin america 
as a result  we are subject to risks that may interrupt or limit our ability to operate our delivery centers or increase the cost of operating in these geographic areas  which could harm our results of operations and financial condition  including security concerns  such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest  crime  political instability or terrorist activity  health concerns  natural disasters  inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions  such as large scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities  transportation  or telecommunications providers  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries  nationalization of our operations  and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings  differing employment practices  prevailing wage rates and labor issues  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices  including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti corruption laws and regulations  and regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ among jurisdictions 
we may be disproportionately exposed to interruption of or limitations to the operation of our business or increases in operating costs in these geographic areas due to these or other factors 
as a result  any interruption or limitation of  or increase in costs related to  our operations in these geographic areas could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation  penalties and cause us to lose clients we are dependent on it networks and systems to process  transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients 
security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
we are also required at times to manage  utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or customer data 
as a result  we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect this information  such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information 
if any person  including any of our employees  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data  we could be subject to monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer data  whether through systems failure  employee negligence  fraud or misappropriation  could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
similarly  unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients  whether by our employees or third parties  could result in negative publicity  legal liability and damage to our reputation  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our financial results depend on our capacity utilization  in particular our ability to forecast our clients customer demand and make corresponding decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and operating expenses our delivery center utilization rates have a substantial and direct effect on our profitability  and we may not achieve desired utilization rates 
our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to maintain and increase capacity in each of our delivery centers during peak and non peak hours  our ability to predict our clients customer demand for our services and thereby to make corresponding decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and other operating expenditures in each of our delivery center locations  our ability to hire and assimilate new employees and manage employee turnover  and our need to devote time and resources to training  professional development and other non chargeable activities 
however  because the majority of our business is inbound from our clients customer initiated encounters  we have significantly higher utilization during peak weekday periods than during off peak night and weekend periods 
we have experienced periods of idle capacity  particularly in our multi client delivery centers 
historically  we experience idle peak period capacity upon opening a new delivery center or termination or completion of a large client program 
we may consolidate or close under performing delivery centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in the event we close delivery centers in the future  we may be required to record restructuring or impairment charges  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain desired delivery center capacity utilization 
as a result of the fixed costs associated with each delivery center  quarterly variations in client volumes  many of which are outside our control  can have a material adverse effect on our utilization rates 
if our utilization rates are below expectations in any given period  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for that period could be adversely affected 
our business depends on uninterrupted service to clients our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our facilities  computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  terrorist or cyber attacks  sabotage  telecommunications interruption or failure  labor shortages  weather conditions  natural disasters and other similar events 
additionally  severe weather can cause our employees to miss work and interrupt the delivery of our services  resulting in a loss of revenue 
in the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our locations including our corporate headquarters building  our business could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to pay contractual damages or face the suspension or loss of a client s business 
further  the impacts associated with global climate change  such as rising sea levels or increased and intensified storm activity  may cause increased business interruptions or may require the relocation of our facilities located in low lying coastal areas 
although we maintain property and business interruption insurance  such insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur 
many of our contracts utilize performance pricing that link some of our fees to the attainment of various performance or business targets  which could increase the variability of our revenue and operating margin a majority of our contracts include performance clauses that condition some of our fees on the achievement of agreed upon performance standards or milestones 
these performance standards can be complex and often depend in some measure on our clients actual levels of business activity or other factors outside of our control 
if we fail to satisfy these measures  it could reduce our revenue under the contracts or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms 
our contracts provide for early termination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results most of our contracts do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue and the profitability of each client program may fluctuate  sometimes significantly  throughout the various stages of a program 
our contracts generally enable the clients to terminate the contract or reduce customer interaction volumes 
our larger contracts generally require the client to pay a contractually agreed amount and or provide prior notice in the event of early termination 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect early termination fees 
we may not be able to offset increased costs with increased service fees under long term contracts some of our larger long term contracts allow us to increase our service fees if and to the extent certain cost or price indices increase 
the majority of our expenses are payroll and payroll related  which includes healthcare costs 
over the past several years  payroll costs  including healthcare costs  have increased at a rate much greater than that of general cost or price indices 
increases in our service fees that are based upon increases in cost or price indices may not fully compensate us for increases in labor and other costs incurred in providing services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover increases in our costs through increased service fees 
our business may be affected by our ability to obtain financing from time to time  we may need to obtain debt or equity financing for capital expenditures  stock repurchases  payment of existing obligations  replenishment of cash reserves  acquisitions or joint ventures 
additionally  our existing credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing  or that any such financing would be on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the financial covenants under our debt agreements or  in the event of noncompliance  will be able to obtain waivers or amendments from the lenders 
our business may be affected by risks associated with international operations and expansion an important component of our growth strategy is continued international expansion 
there are certain risks inherent with conducting international business  including but not limited to management of personnel overseas  longer payment cycles and or difficulties in accounts receivable collections  foreign currency exchange rates  difficulties in complying with foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political and social instability  as demonstrated by terrorist threats  regime change  increasing tension in the middle east and other regions  and the resulting need for enhanced security measures  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one or more of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our international operations successfully 
our financial results may be impacted by foreign currency exchange risk we serve an increasing number of our clients from delivery centers in other countries such as argentina  canada  costa rica  mexico  and the philippines 
contracts with these clients are typically priced  invoiced  and paid in us dollars or other foreign currencies while the costs incurred to operate these delivery centers are denominated in the functional currency of the applicable operating subsidiary 
therefore  fluctuations between the currencies of the contracting and operating subsidiary present foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and approximately of our revenue is derived from contracts denominated in other currencies  our results of operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
while we enter into forward and option contracts collars to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  the foreign exchange exposure between the contracting and operating subsidiaries is not hedged 
since the operating subsidiary assumes the foreign exchange exposure  its operating margins could decrease if the operating subsidiary s currency strengthens against the contracting subsidiary s currency 
for example  our operating subsidiaries are at risk if their functional currency strengthens against the contracting subsidiary s currency typically the us dollar 
if the us dollar devalues against the operating subsidiaries functional currency  the financial results of those operating subsidiaries and teletech upon consolidation will be negatively affected 
while our hedging strategy effectively offsets a portion of these foreign currency changes  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully hedge this foreign currency exchange risk or that the value of the us dollar will not materially weaken 
if we fail to manage our foreign currency exchange risk  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to counterparty credit risk and market risk with respect to financial transactions with our financial institutions the recent global economic and credit crisis weakened the creditworthiness of many financial institutions  and in some circumstances caused previously financially solvent financial institutions to file for bankruptcy 
the counterparties to our hedge transactions are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions  and we are subject to risks that these counterparties become insolvent and fail to perform their financial obligations under these hedge transactions 
our hedging exposure to counterparty credit risk is not secured by any collateral 
if one or more of the counterparties to one or more of our hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings  we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 
our primary exposure will depend on many factors but  generally  our credit exposure will depend on foreign exchange rate movements relative to the contracted foreign exchange rate and whether any gains result that are not realized due to a counterparty default 
while all of our counterparty financial institutions were investment grade rated by the national rating agencies as of december   we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties 
we also have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions  and interest rate swaps with counterparty banks  that were investment grade rated at december  we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of these financial and other institutions and their ability to fund their obligations when required under our agreements 
our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements because we provide services to our clients customers  who reside in countries  we are subject to numerous  and sometimes conflicting  legal regimes on matters as diverse as import export controls  content requirements  trade restrictions  tariffs  taxation  sanctions  government affairs  immigration  internal and disclosure control obligations  data privacy and labor relations 
violations of these regulations could result in liability for monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution  unfavorable publicity  restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations 
due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate  local laws might be insufficient to protect our contractual and intellectual property rights  among other rights 
changes in us federal  state and international laws and regulations may adversely affect the sale of our services  including expansion of overseas operations 
in the us  some of our services must comply with various federal and state regulations regarding the method of placing outbound telephone calls 
in addition  we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients businesses that are transferred to us 
changes in these regulations and requirements  or new restrictive regulations and requirements  may slow the growth of our services or require us to incur substantial costs 
changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions  such as preventing us from using offshore resources to provide our services  or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions 
these changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets 
our financial results and projections may be impacted by our ability to maintain and find new locations for our delivery centers in countries with stable wage rates our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
as a result  our future growth is dependent upon our ability to find cost effective locations in which to operate  both domestically and internationally 
some of our delivery centers are located in countries that have experienced rising standards of living  which may in turn require us to increase employee wages 
in addition  approximately  employees outside the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although we anticipate that the terms of agreements will not impact us in a manner materially different than other companies located in these countries  we may not be able to pass increased labor costs on to our clients 
there is no assurance that we will be able to find cost effective locations 
any increases in labor costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the business process outsourcing markets are highly competitive  and we might not be able to compete effectively our ability to compete will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to initiate  develop and maintain new client relationships  maintain and expand existing client programs  staff and equip suitable delivery center facilities in a timely manner  and develop new solutions and enhance existing solutions we provide to our clients 
moreover  we compete with a variety of companies with respect to our offerings  including large multinational providers  including the service arms of large global technology providers  offshore service providers in lower cost locations that offer services similar to those we offer  often at highly competitive prices  niche solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market  industry segment or service area  and most importantly  the in house operations of clients or potential clients 
because our primary competitors are the in house operations of existing or potential clients  our performance and growth could be adversely affected if our existing or potential clients decide to provide in house business process services they currently outsource  or retain or increase their in house business processing services and product support capabilities 
in addition  competitive pressures from current or future competitors also could cause our services to lose market acceptance or put downward pressure on the prices we charge for our services and on our operating margins 
if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to develop our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand our success depends on our ability to develop and implement systems technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry developments and client needs 
our continued growth and future profitability will be highly dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to develop new technologies that expand our existing solutions and offerings  achieve cost efficiencies in our existing delivery center operations  and introduce new solutions that leverage and respond to changing technological developments 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis 
our integration of new technologies may not achieve their intended cost reductions and services and technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our service offerings uncompetitive or obsolete 
our failure to maintain our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
disruption to the company s supply chain for eloyalty could adversely affect our eloyalty business damage or disruption to the suppliers for the company s eloyalty subsidiary or to the company s distribution capabilities due to weather  natural disaster  fire  terrorism  pandemic  strikes  or other reasons could impair eloyalty s ability to sell its products and services 
failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events  or to effectively manage such events if they occur  particularly when a product is sourced from a single location  could adversely affect the company s business or financial results 
our business could be negatively impacted by security threats and other disruptions major equipment failures  natural disasters  including severe weather  terrorist acts  cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security that affect our wireline and gigapop networks  including transport facilities  communications switches  routers  or other equipment or third party owned local and long distance networks on which we rely  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these events could disrupt our operations  require significant resources  result in a loss of clients or impair our ability to attract new clients  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the products and services utilized by us and our suppliers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others some of our products and services use intellectual property that we own 
we also purchase products and services from suppliers  including device suppliers and service providers that incorporate or utilize intellectual property 
we and some of our suppliers and service providers have received  and may receive in the future  assertions and claims from third parties that the products of software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties 
these claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services 
these claims and assertions also could subject us to costly litigation and significant liabilities for damages or royalty payments  or require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling certain products and services 
the intellectual property that we develop may not be unique or may become obsolete or outdated some of the intellectual property developed by us may not receive favorable treatment from the united states patent and trademark office or similar foreign intellectual property adjudication and registration agencies 
intellectual property for which we have a patent pending status may not be granted a patent or may be determined to have been filed later than similar technologies products and services or may be determined to materially conflict with similar technologies  products and services 
technologies  products and services upon which we rely to provide services to our clients or which serve to differentiate our services from our competitors may become obsolete or outdated 
all of these factors could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to recruit  hire  train and retain key executives or qualified employees  our business will be adversely affected our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit  train  and retain qualified personnel 
we generally experience high employee turnover and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force 
demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages  including english  and or certain technologies may exceed supply  as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving technologies 
in addition  certain delivery centers are located in geographic areas with relatively low unemployment rates  which could make it more costly to hire qualified personnel 
our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting  training  or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our success is also dependent upon the efforts  direction and guidance of our executive management team 
although members of our executive team are subject to non competition agreements  they can terminate their employment at any time 
the loss of any member of our senior management team could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and growth potential 
if we fail to integrate businesses and assets that we may acquire through joint ventures or acquisitions  we may lose clients and our liquidity  capital resources and profitability may be adversely affected we may pursue joint ventures or strategic acquisitions of companies with services  technologies  industry specializations  or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business 
acquisitions and joint ventures often involve a number of special risks  including the following we may encounter difficulties integrating acquired software  operations and personnel and our management s attention could be diverted from other business concerns  we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired technology and rights into our service offerings and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the businesses or assets we acquire may fail to achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated  causing us to incur additional debt to fund operations and to impair the assets from our acquisitions  we may assume liabilities associated with the sale of the acquired company s products or services  our resources may be diverted in asserting and defending our legal rights and we may ultimately be liable for contingent and other liabilities  not previously disclosed to us  of the companies that we acquire  acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business and dilute our ownership interest  acquisitions may result in litigation from former employees or third parties  and due diligence may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  ownership rights and legal contingencies  among other matters 
we may pursue strategic alliances in the form of joint ventures and partnerships  which involve many of the same risks as acquisitions as well as additional risks associated with possible lack of control if we do not have a majority ownership position 
any of the factors identified above could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the market value of our common stock 
in addition  negotiation of potential acquisitions and the resulting integration of acquired businesses  products  or technologies  could divert management s time and resources 
future acquisitions could cause us to issue dilutive equity or incur debt  contingent liabilities  additional amortization charges from intangible assets  asset impairment charges  or impairment charges for in process research and development and other indefinite lived intangible assets that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face risks related to health epidemics  which could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our business could be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics  including  but not limited to  outbreaks of the hn influenza virus commonly known as the swine flu  the avian flu  and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
outbreaks of sars in and and the avian flu in  and alarmed people around the world  raising issues pertaining to health and travel and undermining confidence in the world s economy 
more recently  cases of the hn virus have been identified internationally  including confirmed human outbreaks and deaths 
any prolonged epidemic of the hn virus  avian flu  sars  or other contagious infection in the markets in which we do business may result in worker absences  lower asset utilization rates  voluntary closure of our offices and delivery centers  travel restrictions on our employees  and other disruptions to our business 
moreover  health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the closure of our offices and delivery centers 
any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations  result in a significant decrease in demand for our services  and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business we enter into forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations 
the united states congress has passed  and the president has signed into law  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the financial reform act 
the financial reform act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions  including foreign currency and interest rate hedging transactions 
the financial reform act requires the commodities futures and trading commission to promulgate rules relating to the financial reform act 
until the rules relating to the financial reform act are established  we do not know how these regulations will affect us 
the rules adopted by the commodities futures and trading commission may in the future impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges to reduce foreign exchange and interest rate uncertainty and thus protect cash flows 
in addition  the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties will be required to comply with the financial reform act s new requirements 
it is possible that the costs of such compliance will be passed on to customers such as ourselves 
risks relating to our common stock the market price for our common stock may be volatile the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to  among other factors  the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results  announcements of new contracts or contract cancellations  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  our ability to meet the expectations of securities analysts  conditions or trends in the business process outsourcing industry  changes in the market valuations of other business process outsourcing companies  developments in countries where we have significant delivery centers  gigapops or operations  the ability of our clients to pay for our services  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq global select market and the market for bpo providers in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
you may suffer significant dilution as a result of our outstanding stock options and our equity incentive programs we have adopted benefit plans for the compensation of our employees and directors under which restricted stock units rsus and options to purchase our common stock have been and will continue to be granted 
options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were outstanding at december   of which approximately million shares were exercisable 
rsus representing approximately million shares were outstanding at december   all of which were unvested 
the large number of shares issuable upon exercise of our options and other equity incentive grants could have a significant depressing effect on the market price of our stock and cause dilution to the earnings per share of our common stock 
our chairman and chief executive officer has control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders kenneth d 
tuchman  our chairman and chief executive officer  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  mr 
tuchman could exercise control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders  including the election of our entire board of directors 
therefore  a change in control of our company could not be effected without his approval 
our controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud our management  including our ceo and cfo  believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs 
inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
while the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls  such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and such assumptions  while reasonable  may not take into account all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec to implement section  we are required to furnish a report by our management to include in this form k regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
we have in the past discovered  and may potentially in the future discover  areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price

we believe that our revenue will grow over the long term as global demand for our services is fueled by the following trends increased focus on the customer experience 
given the strong correlation between customer satisfaction and improved profitability  we believe that more companies are increasingly focused on selecting outsourcing partners  such as teletech  that can deliver strategic solutions across a continuum of capabilities that are designed to grow revenue and optimize the customer experience versus merely reduce costs 
focus on partners who can offer multi channel  technology rich customer experience solutions

furthermore  by spreading our fixed costs across a larger revenue base and increasing our asset utilization  we expect our profitability to improve over time 
increasing percentage of company operations being outsourced to most capable third party partners 
having experienced success with outsourcing a portion of their business processes  companies are increasingly inclined to outsource a larger percentage of this work 
we believe companies will continue to consolidate their business processes with third party partners  such as teletech  who are financially stable and able to invest in their business while also demonstrating an extensive global operating history and an ability to cost effectively scale to meet their evolving needs 
increasing adoption of outsourcing across broader groups of industries 
early adopters of the business process outsourcing trend  such as the media and communications industries  are being joined by companies in other industries  including healthcare  retail and financial services 
these companies are beginning to adopt outsourcing to improve their business processes and competitiveness 
for example  we see increasing interest in our services from companies in the healthcare  retail and financial services industries 
we believe the number of other industries that will adopt or increase their level of outsourcing will continue to grow  further enabling us to increase and diversify our revenue and client base 
focus on speed to market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations 
as companies broaden their product offerings and seek to enter new emerging markets  they are looking for outsourcing partners that can provide speed to market while reducing their capital and operating risk 
to achieve these benefits  companies are seeking bpo partners with an extensive operating history  an established global footprint  the financial strength to invest in innovation to deliver more strategic capabilities and the ability to scale and meet customer demands quickly

our business strategy to grow and diversify our revenue  increase profitability and strengthen our industry position includes the following elements capitalize on the favorable trends in the global outsourcing environment  which we believe will include more companies that want to modify their approach to outsourcing based on total value delivered versus the lowest priced provider  seek a partner that can deliver strategic consulting and operational execution around customer centric strategies  focus on partners who can offer fully integrated revenue generation solutions  address the growing complexity of managing multiple customer communication channels  including voice  self service  email  chat and text  take advantage of cost efficiencies through the adoption of cloud based or managed technology solutions  consolidate outsourcing partners with those that have a solid financial position  adequate capital resources to sustain a long term relationship and globally diverse delivery capabilities across a broad range of solutions  and take advantage of cost efficiencies through the adoption of cloud based technology solutions 
deepen and broaden existing client relationships  continue to diversify revenue into higher margin offerings such as professional services  revenue generation  talent acquisition  learning innovation services and our managed technology offerings  win business with new clients and focus on end to end offerings in targeted industries  such as healthcare  retail and financial services  where we expect accelerating adoption of customer experience management  continue to invest in innovative proprietary technology and new business offerings  improve our operating margins through selective profit improvement initiatives  increase asset utilization of our globally diverse delivery centers by providing services during non peak hours with minimal incremental investment  scale our work from home offering to increase operational flexibility  and selectively pursue acquisitions that extend our capabilities  geographic reach and or industry expertise 
as we further develop and continue to scale our strategic business units  we are continually evaluating ways to maximize shareholder value  which may include the disposition of business units  in whole or in part  that could take the form of asset sales  mergers  sales of equity interests in our subsidiaries privately or through a public offering or the spin off of equity interests of our subsidiaries to our shareholders 
our financial results in  our revenue increased to  million over the year  which included an increase of or million due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
this revenue increase was due to an increase in existing client programs  the addition of new clients  and the acquisition of peppers rogers group and the acquisition of eloyalty corporation 
our income from operations increased to million or of revenue in from million or of revenue in income from operations in included million and million of restructuring charges and asset impairments  respectively 
our offshore delivery centers serve clients based both in north america and in other countries 
our offshore delivery capacity spans five countries with  workstations and currently represents of our global delivery capabilities 
revenue from services provided in these offshore locations was million and represented of our total revenue for  excluding revenue from the two acquisitions  as compared to million and of our total revenue for our cash flow from operations allowed us to finance a significant portion of our capital needs and stock repurchases through internally generated cash flows 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  total debt of million  and a total debt to total capitalization ratio of 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million under the stock repurchase program 
since inception of the program through december   the board has authorized the repurchase of shares up to an aggregate value of million  of which we have purchased million shares for million 
as of december   we held of our outstanding shares of common stock in treasury 
business overview our business provides customer experience strategy  technology and business process outsourcing solutions for a variety of industries through our global delivery centers 
our north american bpo segment is comprised of sales to all clients based in north america encompassing the us and canada  while our international bpo segment is comprised of sales to all clients based in all countries outside of north america 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the preparation of our segment information 
bpo services the bpo business generates revenue based primarily on the amount of time our associates or consultants devote to a client s program 
we primarily focus on large global corporations in the following industries automotive  broadband  cable  financial services  government  healthcare  logistics  media and entertainment  retail  technology  travel  and wireline and wireless telecommunications 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
the majority of our revenue is from multi year contracts and we expect this trend to continue 
however  we do provide certain client programs on a short term basis 
we have historically experienced annual attrition of existing client programs of approximately to of our revenue 
attrition of existing client programs during and was and  respectively 
the bpo industry is highly competitive 
we compete primarily with the in house business processing operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain third party bpo providers 
our ability to sell our existing services or gain acceptance for new products or services is challenged by the competitive nature of the industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell services to new clients  renew relationships with existing clients  or gain client acceptance of our new products 
our ability to renew or enter into new multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  is dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which our clients operate 
a continued weakening of the us or the global economy could lengthen sales cycles or cause delays in closing new business opportunities 
our potential clients typically obtain bids from multiple vendors and evaluate many factors in selecting a service provider  including  among others  the scope of services offered  the service record of the vendor and price 
we generally price our bids with a long term view of profitability and  accordingly  we consider all of our fixed and variable costs in developing our bids 
we believe that our competitors  at times  may bid business based upon a short term view  as opposed to our longer term view  resulting in a lower price bid 
while we believe our clients perceptions of the value we provide results in our being successful in certain competitive bid situations  there are often situations where a potential client may prefer a lower cost 
our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
an improvement in the local or global economies where our delivery centers are located could lead to increased labor related costs 
in addition  our industry experiences high personnel turnover  and the length of training time required to implement new programs continues to increase due to increased complexities of our clients businesses 
this may create challenges if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs and need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
we may have difficulties managing the timeliness of launching new or expanded client programs and the associated internal allocation of personnel and resources 
this could cause slower than anticipated revenue growth and or higher than expected costs primarily related to hiring  training and retaining the required workforce  either of which could adversely affect our operating results 
quarterly  we review our capacity utilization and projected demand for future capacity 
in conjunction with these reviews  we may decide to consolidate or close under performing delivery centers  including those impacted by the loss of a client program  in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in addition  because clients may request that we serve their customers from international delivery centers with lower prevailing labor rates  in the future we may decide to close one or more of our delivery centers  even though it is generating positive cash flow  because we believe the future profits from conducting such work outside the current delivery center may more than compensate for the one time charges related to closing the facility 
our profitability is influenced by our ability to increase capacity utilization in our delivery centers 
we attempt to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity when planning the development and opening of new delivery centers or the expansion of existing delivery centers 
as such  management considers numerous factors that affect capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations  or expansions of existing programs and the potential size and timing of new client contracts that we expect to obtain 
we continue to win new business with both new and existing clients 
to respond more rapidly to changing market demands  to implement new programs and to expand existing programs  we may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
this is largely due to the significant time required to negotiate and execute large  complex bpo client contracts and the difficulty of predicting specifically when new programs will launch 
we internally target capacity utilization in our delivery centers at to of our available workstations 
as of december   the overall capacity utilization in our multi client centers was 
the table below presents workstation data for our multi client centers as of december  and dedicated and managed centers  and  workstations  at december  and  respectively are excluded from the workstation data as unused workstations in these facilities are not available for sale 
our utilization percentage is defined as the total number of utilized production workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations 
we may change the designation of shared or dedicated centers based on the normal changes in our business environment and client needs 
december  december  total production workstations in use in use total production workstations in use in use multi client centers sites open year sites open year total multi client centers we continue to see demand from all geographic regions to utilize our offshore delivery capabilities and expect this trend to continue with our clients 
in light of this trend  we plan to continue to selectively retain capacity and expand into new offshore markets 
as we grow our offshore delivery capabilities and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations increase  we continue to actively manage this risk via a multi currency hedging program designed to minimize operating margin volatility 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery of service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the bpo inbound and outbound service fees are based on either a per minute  per hour  per transaction or per call basis 
certain client programs provide for adjustments to monthly billings based upon whether we achieve  exceed or fail certain performance criteria 
adjustments to monthly billings consist of contractual bonuses penalties  holdbacks and other performance based contingencies 
revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of future services or meeting other specified performance conditions 
revenue also consists of services for agent training  program launch  professional consulting  fully hosted or managed technology and learning innovation services 
these service offerings may contain multiple element arrangements whereby we determine if those service offerings represent separate units of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value  and where return rights exist  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control 
if those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting  revenue is recognized as services are provided 
if those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting  revenue for the delivered services are bundled into one unit of accounting and recognized over the life of the arrangement or at the time all services and deliverables have been delivered and satisfied 
we allocate revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence  and then estimated selling price 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately 
third party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
estimated selling price is based on our best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices in different geographies  service offerings  and customer classifications 
once we allocate revenue to each deliverable  we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
periodically  we will make certain expenditures related to acquiring contracts or provide up front discounts for future services 
these expenditures are capitalized as contract acquisition costs and amortized in proportion to the expected future revenue from the contract  which in most cases results in straight line amortization over the life of the contract 
amortization of these costs is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
we continually review the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future tax periods under the more likely than not criteria 
in making this judgment  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is required 
we follow a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  and settlement of issues under audit 
interest and penalties relating to income taxes and uncertain tax positions are accrued net of tax in provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
in the future  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside our control 
our effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
further  we are subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions  in which we operate  as well as the requirements  pronouncements and rulings of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
we estimate our annual effective tax rate each quarter based on a combination of actual and forecasted results of subsequent quarters 
consequently  significant changes in our actual quarterly or forecasted results may impact the effective tax rate for the current or future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter  management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management s judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment include  among other things  the age of the identified receivable  client financial condition  previous client payment history and any recent communications with the client 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the forecasted undiscounted cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for possible impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
an intangible asset with an indefinite life a trade name is evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
fair value is estimated as the discounted value of future revenues arising from a trade name using a royalty rate that an independent party would pay for use of that trade name 
an impairment charge is recorded if the trade name s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
we use a three step process to assess the realizability of goodwill based on recently adopted accounting guidance 
the first step  step  is a qualitative assessment that analyzes current economic indicators associated with a particular reporting unit 
for example  we analyze changes in economic  market and industry conditions  business strategy  cost factors  and financial performance  among others  to determine if there would be a significant decline to the fair value of a particular reporting unit 
a qualitative assessment also includes analyzing the excess fair value of a reporting unit over its carrying value from impairment assessments performed in previous years 
if the qualitative assessment indicates a stable or improved fair value  no further testing is required 
if a qualitative assessment indicates that a significant decline to fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not  or if a reporting unit s fair value has historically been closer to its carrying value  we will proceed to step testing where we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on discounted future probability weighted cash flows 
if step indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  we will proceed to step where the fair value of the reporting unit will be allocated to assets and liabilities as they would in a business combination 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value calculated in step we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units 
the most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services  projected labor costs  as well as contract negotiation status 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
we use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
as of december   the company s assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair values of the company s reporting units were substantially in excess of their estimated carrying values  and therefore goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired 
if actual results are less than the assumptions used in performing the impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred 
restructuring liability we routinely assess the profitability and utilization of our delivery centers and existing markets 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing delivery centers and complete reductions in workforce to enhance future profitability 
severance payments that occur from reductions in workforce are in accordance with postemployment plans and or statutory requirements that are communicated to all employees upon hire date  therefore  we recognize severance liabilities when they are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable 
other liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than upon commitment to a plan 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing delivery centers is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant centers  which we determine based on our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords and or our ability to sublease the facility 
if our assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a reversal of previously reported losses 
equity based compensation expense equity based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value 
we recognize equity based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and recognize compensation expense only for shares that are expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is typically the vesting term of the share based payment award 
we estimate the forfeiture rate annually based on historical experience of forfeited awards 
fair value measurement we determine the fair value of our various assets and liabilities based on a framework which measures fair value 
the framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  assumptions about counterparty credit risk  including the ability of each party to execute its obligation under the contract  and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to utilize the best available information 
accordingly  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs 
the valuation techniques required by the new provisions establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange traded derivatives  listed equities and us government treasury securities 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors  and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
instruments in this category include non exchange traded derivatives such as over the counter forwards  options and repurchase agreements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
level instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers needs 
at each balance sheet date  we perform an analysis of all instruments subject to fair value measurements and include in level all of those whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs 
derivatives we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are associated with forecasted revenue in non functional currencies 
we enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt 
upon proper qualification  these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges under current accounting standards 
from time to time  we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our net investment in a foreign operation 
all derivative financial instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  to the extent they are deemed effective 
based on the criteria established by current accounting standards  all of our cash flow hedge contracts are deemed to be highly effective 
changes in fair value of any net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of our net investment in the foreign operation 
any realized gains or losses resulting from the foreign currency cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transactions within revenue 
any realized gains or losses resulting from the interest rate swaps are recognized in interest income expense 
gains and losses from the settlements of our net investment hedge remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until partial or complete liquidation of the applicable net investment 
we also enter into fair value derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with changes in asset and liability balances 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged  with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being recognized in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
while we expect that our derivative instruments will continue to be highly effective and in compliance with applicable accounting standards  if our hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if we determine that forecasted transactions will not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected currently in earnings 
contingencies we record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  management reviews all litigation and claims on a case by case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss 
explanation of key metrics and other items cost of services cost of services principally include costs incurred in connection with our bpo operations  including direct labor  telecommunications  technology costs  printing  postage  sales and use tax and certain fixed costs associated with the delivery centers 
in addition  cost of services includes income related to grants we may receive from local or state governments as an incentive to locate delivery centers in their jurisdictions which reduce the cost of services for those facilities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with administrative services such as sales  marketing  product development  legal settlements  legal  information systems including core technology and telephony infrastructure and accounting and finance 
it also includes equity based compensation expense  outside professional fees ie  legal and accounting services  building expense for non delivery center facilities and other items associated with general business administration 
restructuring charges  net restructuring charges  net primarily include costs incurred in conjunction with reductions in force or decisions to exit facilities  including termination benefits and lease liabilities  net of expected sublease rentals 
interest expense interest expense includes interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our debts and capitalized lease obligations 
other income the main components of other income are miscellaneous income not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction gains 
other expenses the main components of other expenses are expenditures not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction losses 
presentation of non gaap measurements free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap liquidity measurement 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property  plant and equipment 
free cash flow is not a measure determined by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for income from operations  net income  net cash provided by operating activities  or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful  in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities  because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
free cash flow also includes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions  investments and other needs that may arise 
the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for our consolidated results amounts in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  plant and equipment free cash flow purchases of property  plant and equipment for the years ended december    and are net of proceeds from a government grant of million  zero  and million  respectively 
we discuss factors affecting free cash flow between periods in the liquidity and capital resources section below

cost of services as a percentage of revenue in the north american bpo segment increased compared to the prior year 
in absolute dollars the increase was due to a million increase in technology costs primarily related to the acquisition of eloyalty  and a million increase in employee related expenses due to increase volumes in existing programs and the acquisition of eloyalty offset partially by a net decrease in short term government programs and other program completions 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in telecommunications expenses primarily associated with a short term government program that ended in  a million decrease in deferred training costs  a million decrease for facility and occupancy expenses and a million net decrease in other expenses

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis for and was million and million  respectively 
for the north american bpo segment  the depreciation expense decreased both in absolute value and as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior year 
this decrease in value was due to restructuring activities and delivery center closures which have better aligned our capacity to our operational needs  and asset impairments recorded during resulting in the reduction of long lived assets utilized  thereby reducing depreciation expense 
for the international bpo segment  depreciation expense remained constant in absolute value while decreasing as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior year 
this change in value was due to a decrease in capital expenditures  restructuring activities and delivery center closures which have better aligned our capacity to our operational needs  offset by increases related to additional amortization expense of customer relationships from the recent acquisition 
restructuring charges during  we recorded a net million of restructuring charges compared to million in during both and  we undertook reductions in both our north american bpo and the international bpo segments to better align our capacity and workforce with the current business needs

during  we recorded million in severance related expenses and million in delivery center closure costs in both the north american bpo and the international bpo segments 
impairment losses during  we recorded million of impairment charges compared to million of impairment charges in in both and  these impairment charges related to the reduction of the net book value of certain leasehold improvements in both the north american bpo and the international bpo segments 
other income expense for  interest income increased to million from million in  primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest expense increased to million during from million during this increase was due to a higher outstanding balance on our credit facility

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis for and was million and million  respectively 
for the north american bpo segment  the depreciation expense decreased slightly in absolute value while it increased slightly as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior year 
for the international bpo segment  the depreciation expense decreased in absolute value and as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior year 
this decrease in value was due to a decrease in capital expenditures  restructuring activities and delivery center closures which have better aligned our capacity to our operational needs as well as asset impairments recorded during december  and  resulting in the reduction of long lived assets utilized  thereby reducing depreciation expense year over year 
restructuring charges during  we recorded a net million of restructuring charges compared to million in during  we undertook reductions in both our north american bpo and international bpo segments to better align our capacity and workforce with the current business needs 
we recorded million in severance related expenses  and million in delivery center closure costs in both the north american bpo and international bpo segments 
during  we recorded million in severance related expenses and million in delivery center closure costs in both the north american bpo and international bpo segments  and a million reduction in our estimates of previously recorded delivery center closure charges in the north american bpo segment 
impairment losses during  we recorded million of impairment charges compared to million of impairment charges in in both and  these impairment charges related to the reduction of the net book value of certain leasehold improvements in both the north american bpo and international bpo segments 
other income expense for  interest income decreased to million from million in  primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense remained relatively flat between and at million 
other income increased during as a result of the settlement of a newgen results corporation legal claim which resulted in a gain of million see note to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was 
this compared to an effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate increased due to million in incremental income taxes owed to the us associated with our decision to repatriate million in foreign earnings which had previously been considered permanently invested outside the united states 
in addition  income taxes increased because we recorded a million deferred tax liability in the us related to foreign tax assets that will no longer be able to offset tax in more than one jurisdiction 
income taxes also increased due to a million increase to the deferred tax valuation allowance  million of this increase arising in the fourth quarter due to our change in judgment concerning the recoverability of tax assets in one european jurisdiction 
income taxes also increased by million related to the million gain recorded in other income expense  net as discussed above and million of other charges 
offsetting these increases is a million reduction to income taxes for foreign tax planning strategies associated with our international operations 
without these items our effective tax rate for would have been liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations  our cash and cash equivalents  and borrowings under our credit agreement  dated october  the credit agreement 
during the year ended december   we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents  and available credit will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we manage a centralized global treasury function in the united states with a particular focus on concentrating and safeguarding our global cash and cash equivalents 
while the majority of our cash resides offshore  we prefer to hold us dollars in addition to the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries 
we expect to use our offshore cash to support working capital and growth of our foreign operations 
while there are no assurances  we believe our global cash is protected given our cash management practices  banking partners  and utilization of diversified  high quality investments 
we have global operations that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may positively or negatively impact our liquidity 
we are also exposed to higher interest rates associated with our variable rate debt 
to mitigate these risks  we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps through our cash flow hedging program

we primarily utilize our credit agreement to fund working capital  general operations  stock repurchases and other strategic activities  such as the acquisitions described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and december   we had borrowings of million and zero  respectively  under our credit agreement  and the average daily utilization was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
after consideration for issued letters of credit under the credit agreement  totaling million  our remaining borrowing capacity was million as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our credit agreement 
the amount of capital required over the next months will depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain  upgrade or replace existing assets 
our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could also increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures  among other factors 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing 
as an ongoing practice to provide additional financial flexibility to fund strategic activities  we are evaluating our capital resources and considering an increase in the commitments under our existing credit facility 
our decision to secure additional commitments will be largely based on market conditions  costs  and credit capacity from our bank syndicate 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  at all  or on terms favorable to us 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december    and cash and cash equivalents we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their original maturity to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we diversify the holdings of such cash and cash equivalents considering the financial condition and stability of the counterparty institutions 
cash flows from operating activities we reinvest our cash flows from operating activities in our business for strategic acquisitions and for the purchase of our outstanding stock 
for the years  and we reported net cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the net decrease from to was primarily due to a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  which includes the payment of million for income taxes  and a million decrease in the collection of accounts receivable  offset by a million increase in net income 
the net decrease from to was primarily due to a million decrease in net income  and a million decrease in the collection of accounts receivable  offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash flows from investing activities we reinvest cash in our business primarily to grow our client base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows used in investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the net increase in cash used from investing activities from to was primarily due to the million payment for the acquisition of eloyalty  and a million increase in net capital expenditures  offset by a million decrease from the million payment for the acquisition of peppers rogers group during the net increase in cash used from investing activities from to was primarily due to the million payment for the acquisition of peppers rogers group  the payment of a million newgen results corporation legal claim settlement  and a million increase in net capital expenditures  offset by a million decrease in contract acquisition costs paid 
cash flows from financing activities for the years  and  we reported net cash flows provided by used in financing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the change from to was due to an increase in net borrowings on our line of credit of million and a decrease in cash used to purchase common stock of million 
the change from to was due to a decrease in net payments on our line of credit of million offset by an increase in cash used to purchase common stock of million 
free cash flow free cash flow see presentation of non gaap measurements for definition of free cash flow was million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from the million decrease in cash flow from operating activities  as previously discussed  and a million increase in capital expenditures 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from a significant decrease in cash flow from operating activities 
obligations and future capital requirements future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows amounts in thousands less than year to years to years over years total credit facility capital lease obligations equipment financing arrangements purchase obligations operating lease commitments total includes estimated interest payments based on the weighted average interest rate  current interest rate swap arrangements  and debt outstanding as of december  and unused commitment fees 
contractual obligations to be paid in a foreign currency are translated at the period end exchange rate 
purchase obligations primarily consist of outstanding purchase orders for goods or services not yet received  which are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets until such goods and or services are received 
the contractual obligation table excludes our liabilities of million related to uncertain tax positions because we cannot reliably estimate the timing of future cash payments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the contractual obligations table excludes the contingent consideration arrangement associated with the prg acquisition as we have estimated this liability to be zero at december  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations occasionally we contract with certain of our communications clients to provide us with telecommunication services 
these clients currently represent approximately of our total annual revenue 
we believe these contracts are negotiated on an arm s length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
future capital requirements we expect total capital expenditures in to be consistent with prior year 
approximately of these expected capital expenditures are to support growth in our business and relates to the maintenance for existing assets 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirements for additional delivery center capacity as well as enhancements to our technological infrastructure 
we may consider restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
such transactions could include the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures or the incurrence  assumption  or refinancing of indebtedness and could be material to the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of our operations 
our capital expenditures requirements could also increase materially in the event of acquisition or joint ventures 
in may we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a business unit of eloyalty corporation that provides consulting  system integration and the ongoing management and support of telephony  data  and converged voice over internet protocol customer management environments for million net of certain closing adjustments 
in addition  as of december   we were authorized to purchase an additional million of common stock under our stock repurchase program see part ii item of this form k 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
the launch of large client contracts may result in short term negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program and the beginning of the accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
debt instruments and related covenants on october   we entered into the credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by keybank national association  wells fargo bank  national association  bank of america  na  bbva compass  and jpmorgan chase bank  na the credit agreement provides for a secured revolving credit facility that matures on september  with an initial maximum aggregate commitment of million 
at our discretion  direct borrowing options under the credit agreement include i eurodollar loans with one  two  three  and six month terms  and or ii overnight base rate loans 
the credit agreement also provides for a sub limit for loans or letters of credit in both us dollars and certain foreign currencies  with direct foreign subsidiary borrowing capabilities up to of the total commitment amount 
we may increase the maximum aggregate commitment under the credit agreement to million if certain conditions are satisfied  including that we are not in default under the credit agreement at the time of the increase and that we obtain the commitment of the lenders participating in the increase 
base rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to the greatest of i keybank national association s prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus or iii the one month london interbank offered rate plus  in each case adding a margin based upon our leverage ratio 
eurodollar and alternate currency loans bear interest based upon libor  as adjusted for prescribed bank reserves  plus a margin based upon our leverage ratio 
letter of credit fees are of the stated amount of the letter of credit on the date of issuance  renewal or amendment  plus an annual fee equal to the borrowing margin for eurodollar loans 
facility fees are payable to the lenders in an amount equal to the unused portion of the credit facility and are based upon our leverage ratio 
indebtedness under the credit agreement is guaranteed by certain of our present and future domestic subsidiaries and is secured by security interests subject to permitted liens in the us accounts receivable and cash of the company and certain of our domestic subsidiaries and may be secured by tangible assets of the company and such domestic subsidiaries if borrowings by foreign subsidiaries exceed million and the leverage ratio is greater than to 
we also pledged of the voting stock and of the non voting stock of certain of the company s material foreign subsidiaries and may pledge of the voting stock and of the non voting stock of the company s other foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement  which includes customary financial covenants  may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  purchases of treasury stock and acquisition financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
during  and  borrowings accrued interest at an average rate of approximately   and per annum  respectively  excluding unused commitment fees 
our daily average borrowings during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we had borrowing outstanding of million and zero  respectively  under the credit agreement 
availability was million as of december   reduced from million by million in issued letters of credit  and million as of december   reduced by million in issued letters of credit 
from time to time  we may have unsecured  uncommitted bank lines of credit to support working capital for a few foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   we had no foreign loans outstanding 
as of december   we had only one loan outstanding for approximately million  which is included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the line of credit accrued interest at per annum 
client concentration our five largest clients accounted for  and of our annual revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have experienced long term relationships with our top five clients  ranging from five to years  with the majority of these clients having completed multiple contract renewals with teletech 
the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis and varies greatly based upon specific contract terms 
in addition  clients may adjust business volumes served by us based on their business requirements 
we believe the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
although certain client contracts may be terminated for convenience by either party  we believe this risk is mitigated  in part  by the service level disruptions and transition migration costs that would arise for our clients 
the contracts with our ten largest clients expire between and additionally  a particular client may have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed or  if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we discuss the potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
market risk also includes credit and non performance risk by counterparties to our various financial instruments 
we are exposed to market risks due to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar  as well as credit risk associated with potential non performance of our counterparty banks 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
we enter into derivative instruments to manage and reduce the impact of currency exchange rate changes  primarily between the us dollar canadian dollar  the us dollar philippine peso  the us dollar mexican peso  and the australian dollar philippine peso 
we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable rate debt 
to mitigate against credit and non performance risk  it is our policy to only enter into derivative contracts and other financial instruments with investment grade counterparty financial institutions and  correspondingly  our derivative valuations reflect the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced  nor do we anticipate  any issue related to derivative counterparty defaults 
interest rate risk the interest rate on our credit agreement is variable based upon the prime rate and libor and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
based upon average daily outstanding borrowings during the years ended december  and  interest accrued at a rate of approximately and per annum  respectively 
if the prime rate or libor increased by basis points during the quarter  there would not have been a material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company s interest rate swap arrangements as of december  were as follows notional amount variable rate received fixed rate paid contract commencement date contract maturity date as of december  million month libor april april million month libor may may million we did not have any interest rate swap arrangements as of december  foreign currency risk our subsidiaries in argentina  canada  costa rica  mexico  and the philippines use the local currency as their functional currency for paying labor and other operating costs 
conversely  revenue for these foreign subsidiaries is derived principally from client contracts that are invoiced and collected in us dollars or other foreign currencies 
as a result  we may experience foreign currency gains or losses  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries 
for the years ended december   and  revenue associated with this foreign exchange risk was  and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
the following summarizes relative weakening strengthening of local currencies year ended december  canadian dollar vs

australian dollar in order to mitigate the risk of these non functional foreign currencies from weakening against the functional currencies of the servicing subsidiaries  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  though not  of the projected foreign currency exposure related to client programs served from these foreign countries through our cash flow hedging program 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term  an overall weakening of the non functional foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the segments of the contracting subsidiary over the long term 
cash flow hedging program to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with forecasted revenue in non functional currencies  we purchase forward and or option contracts to acquire the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary at a fixed exchange rate at specific dates in the future 
we have designated and account for these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue in non functional currencies 
while we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we cannot ensure that we will not recognize gains or losses from international transactions  as this is part of transacting business in an international environment 
not every exposure is or can be hedged and  where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign exchange exposure  they are based on forecasts for which actual results may differ from the original estimate 
failure to successfully hedge or anticipate currency risks properly could adversely affect our consolidated operating results 
our cash flow hedging instruments as of december  and are summarized as follows amounts in thousands 
all hedging instruments are forward contracts  except as noted 
as of december  local currency notional amount us dollar notional amount maturing in contracts maturing through canadian dollar march costa rican colon august philippine peso december mexican peso forwards november mexican peso collars december british pound sterling june as of december  local currency notional amount us dollar notional amount canadian dollar philippine peso mexican peso british pound sterling includes contracts to purchase philippine pesos in exchange for new zealand dollars and australian dollars  which are translated into equivalent us dollars on december  and december  includes contracts to purchase british pound sterling in exchange for euros  which are translated into equivalent us dollars on december  and december  the mexican peso collars include call options with a floor total of mxn  and put options with a cap total of mxn  the fair value of our cash flow hedges at december  was assets liabilities amounts in thousands december  maturing in canadian dollar costa rican colon philippine peso mexican peso british pound sterling our cash flow hedges are valued using models based on market observable inputs  including both forward and spot foreign exchange rates  implied volatility  and counterparty credit risk 
the year over year decrease in fair value largely reflects the recent global economic conditions  which resulted in high foreign exchange volatility and a broad strengthening in the us dollar in the second half of we recorded net gains losses of million  million  and million for settled cash flow hedge contracts and the related premiums for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these gains losses were reflected in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
if the exchange rates between our various currency pairs were to increase or decrease by from current period end levels  we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts 
however  any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding increases or decreases in our underlying exposures 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above and in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in their respective local currency 
however  transactions are denominated in other currencies from time to time 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we endeavor to settle these accounts on a timely basis 
for the years ended and  approximately and  respectively  of revenue was derived from contracts denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our results from operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
fair value of debt and equity securities we did not have any investments in debt or equity securities as of december  or
