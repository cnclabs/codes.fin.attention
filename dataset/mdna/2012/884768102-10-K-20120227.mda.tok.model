overview we are a growing  diversified  north american mining company 
in  we were the fifth largest producer of molybdenum in the western world  according to cru international 
on october   we acquired terrane metals corp 
terrane  an exploration and development company in british columbia  canada 
in acquiring terrane  we diversified our asset base of primary molybdenum deposits to include copper and gold from the development of mt 
milligan and exploration opportunities in the other properties acquired 
our principal producing properties are the thompson creek mine tc mine  an open pit molybdenum mine and concentrator in idaho  a joint venture interest in the endako mine  an open pit molybdenum mine  concentrator  and roaster in british columbia and the langeloth metallurgical facility in pennsylvania 
we also have significant resources and future development opportunities within our portfolio of assets 
we are currently in the process of constructing and developing the mt 
milligan project located in british columbia  which has been designed to be a conventional truck shovel open pit mine with a  ton per day copper flotation processing plant  with estimated average annual production of million pounds of copper and  ounces of gold  each in concentrate  over the life of the mine 
construction and development of the mt 
milligan project remained on schedule in with commissioning and start up expected to commence in the third quarter of  and commercial production of copper and gold expected in the fourth quarter of we also have a copper  molybdenum and silver exploration project located in british columbia the berg property  an underground molybdenum exploration project located in british columbia the davidson property and two joint venture exploration projects located elsewhere in canada  one of which is a lead and zinc project the howard s pass property  and the other a gold project the maze lake property 
we are in the process of preparing a scoping study on the berg property  which is expected to be completed by the second half of during  percent of our consolidated molybdenum production was from our tc mine  which had record molybdenum production in and the first half of due to the planned mine pit sequencing and the mining of high grade ore primarily in the bottom of the pit during these periods 
in the second half of  the planned mining activities at tc mine were solely focused on stripping waste material to expose molybdenum bearing ore in the upper walls of the pit and the 
table of contents milling of lower grade stockpiled ore 
this resulted in lower production in the second half of from tc mine with significantly higher cash costs per pound produced 
refer below to operations review for further discussion of our mining operations and non gaap financial measures for the definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced 
our results for  compared with  primarily reflected higher sales volumes and higher average realized molybdenum prices  which were more than offset by higher operating expenses related primarily to the waste stripping activities at our tc mine refer below to financial review for further discussion of our consolidated financial results for the years ended december    and while and production from tc mine is expected to be lower than the record production in and the first half of  we are increasing near term production at our endako mine  with the expected completion of a mill expansion project in the first quarter of the endako mill expansion project includes the construction of a new mill  replacing the existing mill constructed in the s  which is expected to increase ore processing capacity from the existing  tons per day to  tons per day 
commissioning of the new endako mill is now complete and commercial production was achieved on february  the construction of the regrind circuit for the new mill is still in process and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of in the interim  we continue to use the cleaner and regrind circuit in the old mill 
at december   we had million in consolidated cash and million in debt  including capital lease obligations 
in may  we raised million of net proceeds from the issuance of million of senior unsecured notes that mature on june  in december  we entered into an amended and restated gold stream agreement with royal gold giving them the right to purchase an additional interest in the refined gold production from mt 
milligan for million  plus per ounce  or prevailing market price  if lower than per ounce  when the gold is delivered 
when we purchased terrane in  we entered into a similar transaction with royal gold giving them the right to purchase of the refined gold production from mt 
milligan for million 
payments made by royal gold upon signing the original and amended and restated agreements were million and million  respectively 
royal gold will make the remaining future scheduled payments to us in and in the aggregate amount of million 
at december   we estimated future cash capital project expenditures of approximately billion to billion to complete the endako mill expansion and the mt 
milligan mine 
we believe that we have solidified our ability to finance these capital project expenditures with the million of consolidated cash on hand  the remaining proceeds from royal gold of million  million of undrawn capacity under an equipment lease financing for the mobile mining fleet at mt 
milligan  a million undrawn revolving credit facility and our ongoing expected cash flow from operations 
highlights net income for was million  or per share  which included a non cash unrealized gain on common stock purchase warrants of million  or per share 
net income for was million  or per share  which included a non cash unrealized loss on common stock purchase warrants of million  or per share 
non gaap adjusted net income for excluding the non cash unrealized gain on the warrants was million  or per share 
non gaap adjusted net income in was million  or per share 
see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of adjusted net income loss 
non cash unrealized gains and losses on common stock purchase warrants result from a requirement under us gaap to account for 
table of contents outstanding common stock purchase warrants as derivatives  with changes in the fair market value recorded in net income 
consolidated revenues for were million  up approximately from  as a result of an increase in molybdenum pounds sold and a higher sales prices 
the average realized sales price for molybdenum in was per pound  up from per pound in mined molybdenum production for was million pounds  down from a record million pounds in  primarily due to lower grade production from tc mine in the second half of average cash cost per pound produced for was per pound compared to per pound in see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced 
operating cash flows for were million in  compared to million in capital costs incurred for were million  comprised of million for the development of mt 
milligan  million of capital costs for the mill expansion project at the endako mine which reflects our share  and million of other capital costs for the endako and tc mines  the langeloth facility and corporate combined 
the capital costs for included changes in accrued amounts of million and non cash capital lease activity of million  therefore  cash used for capital expenditures for the year was million 
total cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million as of december  total debt as of december  was million  including capital lease obligations  compared to million as of december  outlook we expect significant growth in revenue and cash flow from the expected commencement of commercial copper and gold production from the mt 
milligan project in the fourth quarter of and the growth in molybdenum production from our endako mine as a result of the expected completion of the mill expansion project in the first quarter of our near term financial results can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of molybdenum 
world market prices for molybdenum have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
during the fourth quarter of  the average platts metals week published price for molybdenum oxide was per pound  compared to per pound in the first quarter of  per pound in the second quarter of  and per pound in the third quarter of since december   the monthly average price for molybdenum oxide  as published in platts metals week  has slightly increased  with the monthly average platts metals week published price for january equaling per pound 
we anticipate that the price for molybdenum oxide in will continue to be volatile 
any significant weakness in demand for molybdenum or reduction in molybdenum prices may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
because we cannot control the price of molybdenum  the key operating measures that management focuses on in operating our business are production  cash costs per pound produced and capital 
table of contents expenditures 
we continually review our operating strategy as molybdenum market conditions change

table of contents financial review three months ended december  unaudited net income loss net income for the fourth quarter of was million  or nil per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for the fourth quarter of net income for the fourth quarter of included a non cash unrealized gain on common stock purchase warrants of million  or nil per share 
net loss for the fourth quarter of included a non cash unrealized loss on common stock purchase warrants of million  or per share 
non cash unrealized gains and losses on common stock purchase warrants result from a requirement under us gaap to account for outstanding common stock purchase warrants as a derivative  with changes in the fair market value recorded in net income loss 
on october   certain of our warrants expired unexercised as our stock price was below the c exercise price for such warrants 
as a result  after october   we will not recognize any non cash unrealized gains and losses on these warrants 
when we acquired terrane  we assumed common stock purchase warrants issued by terrane that expire on june  the terrane warrants 
the terrane warrants remain outstanding and  accordingly  we will continue to record unrealized gains and losses on those warrants until they are exercised or expire 
non gaap adjusted net income loss for the fourth quarter of excluding the non cash unrealized gain on the warrants was nil  or nil per share  compared to non gaap adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of excluding the non cash unrealized loss on the warrants of million  or per share 
the break even non gaap results for the fourth quarter of was primarily the result of lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million  higher operating costs at the tc mine and endako mine  lower production and sales volumes and lower molybdenum sales prices  which were partially offset by foreign exchange gains of million 
see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of adjusted net income loss 
revenue revenue in the fourth quarter of was million  down compared to revenue in the fourth quarter of the decrease in revenue resulted from lower sales volumes and lower average realized sales prices 
we sold million pounds of molybdenum in the fourth quarter of  which was million pounds less than the fourth quarter of lower sales volume primarily resulted from lower mined production from tc mine  as planned  in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the average realized sales price for molybdenum in the fourth quarter of was per pound  which was per pound  or  lower compared to the fourth quarter of operating expenses operating expenses for the fourth quarter of were million  which was up from the same quarter in the increase in operating expenses in the fourth of was primarily the result of the waste stripping activities at tc mine 
in addition  for the fourth quarter of  a lower of cost or market product inventory write down of million was recognized for both mines 
as well  operating expenses in the fourth quarter of included a write down of surplus and obsolete materials and supplies inventory of million 
in addition  higher volume of third party purchased molybdenum that was processed and sold resulted in increased operating expenses 
the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from our mines was per pound in the fourth quarter of compared to per pound for the same quarter in cash cost per pound produced was higher in the current quarter compared to the same quarter in 
table of contents mainly due to significantly lower production and higher costs from tc mine  as planned  due to mine pit sequencing and waste stripping activities 
see non gaap financial measures below for the calculation of cash cost per pound produced 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in the fourth quarter of was million compared to million in the fourth quarter of this decrease was primarily due to the lower volume of molybdenum sold from our mines in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of product inventory costs include depreciation  depletion and amortization 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of was million  which increased million compared to million in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expense included million in both the fourth quarter of and of stock based compensation expense 
under us gaap  stock based compensation is included in the specific operating statement categories that include the compensation costs of the employees  officers and directors for which the stock based award applies 
general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of higher compensation costs as a result of additional employees hired during the year and higher outside consulting costs  both of which are associated with the growth of the company during acquisition costs acquisition costs of million during the fourth quarter of related to investment banking fees  legal and consulting costs associated with the terrane acquisition 
exploration expense on april   we terminated our option agreement to acquire an interest in the mount emmons project 
upon termination  we released approximately million held in escrow to us energy corp 
related to minimum amounts in prior years that were required to be spent under the option agreement 
exploration expense for the fourth quarter of was million compared to million for the fourth quarter of the current quarter expenses included million for the berg property  million of exploration drilling expenditures at the tc mine  million for certain property payments  and million at the endako mine reflecting our share 
the exploration expenses included million of expenditures related to the now terminated option agreement for the mount emmons project  together with exploration drilling expenditures of million at the tc mine  million at the mt 
milligan property  and million combined on other properties 
we expect to focus our exploration efforts and resources on completing a scoping study at the berg exploration project copper molybdenum silver property that was acquired in the terrane acquisition 
other income and expense for the fourth quarter of  we recognized an million foreign exchange gain compared to a foreign exchange loss of million for the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the c strengthened against the us  which resulted in an unrealized foreign exchange gain of million on intercompany notes that are denominated in a different currency than their measurement currency and an unrealized foreign exchange gain of million on foreign currency derivative instruments 
the remaining exchange loss was the result of c cash balances that have the 
table of contents us as their measurement currency and on us payables and receivables that have the c as their measurement currency 
for the fourth quarter of  we recognized a foreign exchange loss of million as the result of unrealized losses on foreign currency derivative instruments 
the foreign exchange rate was us c at december  compared to us c at september   us c at december  and us c at september  income and mining tax expense benefit for the fourth quarter of  we had a net tax benefit of million compared to a net tax expense of million for the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter of was impacted by a loss before income taxes resulting in a net tax benefit 
the fourth quarter of was impacted by income before income taxes resulting in higher tax expense 
additionally  the non cash unrealized gain and loss on common stock purchase warrants in the fourth quarter and  respectively  did not generate any income tax expense or benefit 
the tax benefit in the fourth quarter of benefitted from a lower taxable income  a proportionally higher percentage depletion deduction  and foreign tax differences 
three years ended december  net income loss net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  and a net loss of million  or per share  for the year december  net income for the year ended december  included a non cash unrealized gain on common stock purchase warrants of million  or per share 
net income for included a non cash unrealized loss on common stock purchase warrants of million  or per share 
net loss for included a non cash unrealized loss on common share purchase warrants of million  or per share 
the non cash unrealized gains and losses on common stock purchase warrants for the years ended december   and were the result of a requirement under us gaap to account for outstanding common stock purchase warrants as a derivative  with changes in the fair market value recorded in net income 
as discussed above  certain of our warrants expired unexercised on october  as a result  after october   we will not recognize any additional non cash unrealized gains and losses on these common stock purchase warrants 
the terrane warrants remain outstanding  and we will continue to record unrealized gains and losses on those warrants until they are exercised or expire on june  non gaap adjusted net income for the year ended december  excluding the non cash unrealized gain on the warrants was million  or per share 
non gaap adjusted net income for the year ended december  excluding the non cash unrealized loss on the warrants was million  or per share 
the decrease in non gaap adjusted net income for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily the result of higher sales volumes and higher average realized molybdenum prices  which were more than offset by higher operating expenses related primarily to the waste stripping activities at our tc mine and lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million 
non gaap adjusted net income in excluding the non cash unrealized loss on the warrants was million  or per share 
the lower non gaap adjusted net income for was primarily due to significantly lower average realized molybdenum prices 
see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of adjusted net income 

table of contents net income for the year ended december  also included losses on foreign exchange of million  or per share  compared to foreign exchange gains of million in  or per share  and foreign exchange losses of million in  or per share 
revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  which was up from the increase in revenue resulted from higher sales volumes and higher average realized sales prices 
we sold million pounds of molybdenum in  which was million pounds more than the volume sold in the average realized sales price for molybdenum in was per pound  which was per pound higher compared to the average realized sales price for molybdenum in revenue from toll roasted material for third parties was million in  an increase of million compared to million in  primarily as a result of higher market demand 
higher sales volume in resulted primarily from a drawdown of mined production from the tc mine and endako mine  and partly from higher sales volume of third party product that was purchased and sold 
revenue in was million  up million or approximately from million in revenue in increased as a result of higher average realized sales prices for molybdenum  with an average realized price in of per pound  up approximately from per pound in molybdenum sold from our mines in was million pounds  up approximately from million pounds sold in sales volumes from third party product purchased and processed were million pounds in  up from million pounds in revenue from toll roasted material for third parties was million in  up approximately compared to million in primarily as a result of higher volume driven by an increase in commodity prices throughout operating expenses operating expenses in were million  up million  or compared to the same period in the increase in operating expenses in was primarily the result of the waste stripping activities at our tc mine  higher sales volume  an increase in higher cost third party molybdenum that was purchased  processed  and sold  and lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million for both mines 
the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from our mines increased in to per pound from per pound in the increase in the cash cost per pound produced was due to lower production and higher costs at the tc mine in the second half of associated with the planned mine pit sequencing that resulted in increased waste stripping activities  lower grade ore and lower mill recovery rates  which were substantially offset by record production and higher ore grades and mill recovery rates at tc mine in the first half of in addition  cash cost per pound produced at the endako mine was higher in primarily as a result of higher repairs and maintenance costs to crushing and conveying systems and milling equipment 
operating expenses at the endako mine were also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates converting c costs to us 
the foreign exchange rate averaged us c in compared to an average rate of us c in see non gaap financial measures below for the calculation and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced 
operating expenses in were million  up million or approximately from million in  primarily due to higher sales volume in prices for third party molybdenum that was purchased  processed  and sold were up significantly during compared to  which  
table of contents together with the increased sales volumes from third party product purchased  processed  and sold also contributed to higher operating expenses in the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from our mines increased in to per pound from per pound in the increase in the cash cost per pound produced in was primarily the result of a higher cash cost per pound produced at the endako mine due to higher mining and milling costs 
a breakdown of the endako mine in pit conveyor system caused higher ore haulage costs at the mine together with unexpected repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  the endako mine expenses were higher due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates converting c costs to us costs 
the foreign exchange rate averaged us c in compared to an average rate of us c in see non gaap financial measures below for the calculation and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in was million  an increase of million  or approximately compared to the increase in primarily resulted from higher molybdenum sales from our mines in and the depreciation of new mining equipment placed into service since december  product inventory costs include depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in was million or approximately more than million in the increase in primarily resulted from higher molybdenum sales from our mines in this increase was partially offset by the effects of increased mineral reserve estimates established at the tc mine late in the third quarter of product inventory costs include depreciation  depletion and amortization 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in was million  compared to million and million in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expense in   and included million  million  and million  respectively  of non cash stock based compensation expense 
the stock based compensation for and was lower than due to a lower amount of stock based awards granted together with a lower valuation resulting primarily from a significantly lower stock price 
additionally  the stock based compensation included a non cash compensation charge of million related to a voluntary stock option surrender program 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation  general and administrative expense is higher in compared to the increase in general and administrative expense in was primarily the result of higher compensation costs associated with additional employees hired as well as increased strategic and other consulting expenses due to our growth activities 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation  general and administrative expense in was higher than primarily as a result of costs related to first time sec proxy filings and higher compensation costs in acquisition costs acquisition costs of million in related to investment banking fees  legal and consulting costs associated with the terrane acquisition

molybdenum production and cash costs the tc mine had record molybdenum production in and the first half of due to the planned mine pit sequencing and the mining of high grade ore primarily in the bottom of the pit during these periods 
in  the tc mine produced million pounds  down approximately from a record million pounds produced during the overall lower production for was primarily the result of significantly lower production in the second half of due to the lower grade ore and a lower mill recovery rate associated with the planned mine pit sequencing  which somewhat offset record production in the first half of molybdenum production from tc mine was million pounds in the fourth quarter of  which was down compared to the fourth quarter of lower production was primarily the result of a significantly lower ore grade and mill recovery rate due to the mine pit sequencing  as discussed above 
production in was a record high of million pounds compared to production of million pounds primarily due to higher tons mined and milled and higher ore grade in lower production in also was partly impacted by a planned week shutdown in july higher tons mined and milled in compared to was the result of the modified work schedule 
the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced increased to per pound in the fourth quarter of from per pound in the fourth quarter of see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced 
the increase in the fourth quarter cash cost per pound compared to the fourth quarter of was primarily the result of costs related to increased waste stripping activities together with lower production in the fourth quarter of as explained above 
the cash costs in the fourth quarter of included stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  compared to stripping costs of million  or per pound produced in the fourth quarter of the cash cost per pound produced in increased to per pound compared to per pound in primarily due to lower production and higher costs in the second half of associated with the planned mine pit sequencing  increased waste stripping activities and the lower grade ore and mill recovery rates  which was substantially offset by record production and higher ore grades and mill recovery rates at the tc mine in the first half of the cash costs in included stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  compared to stripping costs of million  or per pound produced in see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced 
the cash cost per pound produced in decreased to per pound compared to per pound in primarily due to record production in the cash costs in included stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  compared to stripping costs of million  or per pound produced in the impact of higher production in was partly offset by higher repairs and maintenance costs  higher fuel costs and higher employee compensation costs

see non gaap financial measures for additional information 
molybdenum production and cash costs our share of molybdenum production at the endako mine increased in the fourth quarter of to million pounds from million pounds in the fourth quarter of this increase was primarily due to higher tons mined and milled partly offset by lower ore grade and mill recovery rate in the fourth quarter of for  our share of molybdenum production at the endako mine decreased to million pounds compared to million pounds in this decrease was primarily due to lower ore grade and a lower mill recovery rate in compared to  partly offset by higher tons mined and milled 
our share of molybdenum production at the endako mine in increased slightly to million pounds compared to million pounds produced in the slight increase in production in was primarily due to higher ore tons mined and milled  which was offset by a lower mill recovery rate 
for the first half of  the mine and mill were operating at of capacity as planned due to weak economic conditions 
additionally  production was reduced due to a planned week shutdown in july the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced increased to per pound in the fourth quarter of from per pound in the fourth quarter of see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced 
the cash costs for the endako mine were impacted by higher mining costs primarily due to repairs and 
table of contents maintenance on crushing and conveyor systems  mill equipment repairs  and a write down of surplus and obsolete materials and supplies inventory for the existing mill 
for  the cash cost per pound produced increased to per pound compared to per pound in the increase in cash cost per pound produced in was primarily the result of higher repairs and maintenance costs to crushing and conveying systems  which also resulted in higher ore haulage costs and mill equipment repairs 
additionally  cold and wet weather conditions caused higher than expected downtime in the first half of due to material getting caught in chutes and plugging up screening systems 
costs were also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates converting c costs to us costs 
the foreign exchange rate averaged us c in compared to an average rate of us c in a change in the canadian foreign exchange rate results in a change in the cash cost per pound produced of approximately per pound 
for  the cash cost per pound produced increased to per pound compared to per pound in the increase in cash cost per pound produced in was primarily the result of higher mining and milling costs due to a breakdown of the in pit conveyor system  which resulted in higher truck haulage costs  and higher repairs and maintenance costs in the mill 
costs were also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates converting c costs to us costs 
the foreign exchange rate averaged us c in compared to an average rate of us c in molybdenum sold our share of molybdenum sold from the endako mine in the fourth quarter of was million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound compared to million pounds sold at an average realized sales price of per pound in the fourth quarter of for  our share of molybdenum sold from the endako mine was million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound compared to million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound in for  our share of molybdenum sold from the endako mine was million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound compared to million pounds sold at an average realized sales price of per pound in the decrease in pounds sold in resulted from higher sales in associated with a drawdown of product inventory 
mill expansion project during the three and twelve months ended december   we incurred c million and c million  respectively  representing our share of capital expenditures for the mill expansion project  excluding capitalized interest and debt issuance costs 
total capital expenditures for the endako mill expansion project are estimated at approximately c million c million basis  including start up and commissioning costs 
commissioning of the new endako mill is now complete and commercial production was achieved on february  the construction of the regrind circuit for the new mill is still in process and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of in the interim  we continue to use the cleaner and regrind circuit in the existing mill 
since inception of the project through december   approximately c million has been spent  of which our share is approximately c million 
in december  we entered into an agreement with sojitz pursuant to which the parties agreed that sojitz will pay of the cost of the endako expansion project between c million and c million and that its interest in the endako mine would remain unchanged 
if the cost of the endako expansion project exceeds c million  sojitz agreed it would fund of such excess up to c million  and its share of any amounts above c million would need to be negotiated 
this agreement settled a dispute between the parties regarding the 
table of contents parties respective obligations to fund the total capital cost of the project 
therefore  based upon the final estimated costs of c million c million basis  including start up and commissioning costs  our share of the expansion project capital expenditures are expected to be approximately c million c million

table of contents asset impairments we perform an impairment analysis on an annual basis or more often when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate our long lived assets and goodwill for impairment using a fair value based approach 
at each evaluation  the economic environment  molybdenum prices  and our stock price were considered as impairment indicators for the purposes of these impairment assessments 
goodwill is assessed for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
we performed this annual test for  and  and determined that the fair value of both reporting units were more than their respective carrying values including the goodwill  which did not require us to perform the second step test 
our impairment evaluation of long lived assets for   and did not result in the identification of an impairment of the long lived assets 
however  there may be future impairment charges if there are further declines in the market price of our common shares  molybdenum  copper  and gold prices  the future value of proven and probable mineral reserves  and significant changes in operating costs  level of capital expenditures  foreign currency exchange rates  discount  and interest rates 
such future impairment charges could have a material impact on our financial statements 
mineral reserves and depreciation  depletion and amortization property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment relating to new assets or improvements are capitalized if they extend useful lives or extend functionality 
fixed plant and machinery are amortized using the units of production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on contained pounds to be produced from estimated proven and probable mineral reserves 
facilities  mobile and other equipment are depreciated on either a declining balance basis or a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the life of the mine 
repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred  except when these repairs extend the life or functionality of the asset 
in these instances  that portion of the expenditure is capitalized and amortized over the period benefited 
the estimate that most significantly affects the unit of production rate is the quantity of proven and probable molybdenum mineral reserves 
the estimation of the extent of mineral reserves is a complex task in which a number of estimates and assumptions are made 
these involve the use of geological modeling and sampling  as well as estimates of long term molybdenum prices and future mining costs 
this data could change over time as a result of numerous factors  including new information gained from development activities  evolving production history and a reassessment of the viability of production under different economic conditions 
significant judgment is involved in the reserve estimates  and actual results may differ significantly from current assumptions 
asset retirement obligations accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates of the future costs we will incur to complete the work required to comply with existing laws and regulations at each mining operation 
actual costs may differ from the amounts estimated 
also  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from molybdenum sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  the product has been delivered  title has transferred  and collection is reasonably assured 
our sales contracts specify the point in the delivery process at which title 
table of contents transfers to the customer shipping point or destination 
shipping and handling fees are accounted for on a gross basis under the terms of the contract 
we recognize tolling and calcining revenue under contractual arrangements as the services are performed on a per unit basis 
we enter into provisionally priced sales contracts  whereby the contracts settle at prices to be determined at a future date based upon quoted prices 
the future pricing mechanism of these agreements constitutes an embedded derivative  which is bifurcated and separately marked to an estimated fair value at the end of each period 
changes to the fair value of embedded derivatives related to molybdenum sales agreements are included in molybdenum sales revenue in the determination of net income loss 
income and mining taxes in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates and laws is recognized in income loss in the period in which such changes are enacted 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income  reversal of taxable temporary differences  carry backs  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we make a determination that it ultimately will be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense 
at december   tax valuation allowances totaled approximately million and covered our us  foreign and alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards and some of the canadian capital and non capital tax loss carry forwards 
the determination of our tax expense for the year and its future tax assets and liabilities involves significant management estimation and judgment involving a number of assumptions 
in determining these amounts  management interprets tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and makes estimates of the expected timing of the reversal of future tax assets and liabilities 
we also make estimates of future earnings which affect cross border tax rate assumptions  tax planning strategies and the extent to which potential future tax benefits may be used 
we are subject to assessments by various taxation authorities which may interpret tax legislation differently 
these differences may affect the final amount or the timing of the payment of taxes 
we provide for such differences where known based on management s best estimate of the probable outcome of these matters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our consolidated molybdenum sales represent the sale of molybdenum in various forms from our mines and from third party material that is purchased  processed  and sold 
molybdenum sales for december  were million  with cash generated from operations of million 
for each per pound change in molybdenum prices using the molybdenum pounds sold from our mines in  the impact on our annual pre tax cash flow on sales from our mines would approximate million 
we enter into provisionally priced sales contracts  whereby the contracts settle at prices to be determined at a future date 
the future pricing mechanism of these agreements constitutes an embedded derivative  which is bifurcated and separately marked to estimated fair value at the end of each period 
changes to the fair value of embedded derivatives related to molybdenum sales contracts are included in molybdenum sales revenue in the determination of net income 
to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis  an increase or decrease to molybdenum sales is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing 
accordingly  in times of rising molybdenum prices  molybdenum sales benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior years  in times of falling molybdenum prices  the opposite occurs 
the following table sets forth our outstanding provisionally priced contracts as of december   which all mature in pounds to be sold purchased s lb provisionally priced sales provisionally priced purchases we also enter into certain molybdenum sales contracts to sell future molybdenum production at fixed prices 
these fixed prices may be different than the quoted market price at the date of sale 
the following table sets forth our outstanding fixed price molybdenum sales contracts as of december  december  molybdenum committed s lb average price lb historically  these contracts were recorded as derivatives with changes in the fair value recorded to net income loss 
beginning october   we elected to treat these contracts as normal purchase and normal sales contracts 
as such  these contracts are no longer recorded at market value mark to market at each reporting period 
the mark to market asset of million as of september  was realized in molybdenum sales as we made the physical deliveries related to those contracts 
for the fourth quarter of  a million loss was realized in molybdenum sales related to the september  value 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million in its consolidated statement of operations 
in and  a loss of million and million  respectively  were included in molybdenum sales in its consolidated statements of operations 
in the normal course of operations  we enter into agreements for the purchase of molybdenum 
as of december   we had commitments to purchase approximately million pounds of 
table of contents molybdenum sulfide concentrate from to  to be priced at a discount to the market price for molybdenum oxide at the time of purchase 
on acquisition of thompson creek usa  we acquired an unfavorable contractual agreement to sell of certain production at the tc mine at an amount that was less than the then prevailing market price 
deliveries under this contract commenced in and continued through all deliveries under the forward sales contracts related to this contractual agreement have now been completed and  as a result  as of december   we did not have any remaining liability related to this agreement 
as of december   we had a liability of million related to future deliveries under this agreement 
as this contractual agreement was satisfied by delivery of product  the liability was being drawn down with an offsetting adjustment to molybdenum sales in the determination of net income loss 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various currencies in the normal course of its operations and for capital expenditures 
moreover  with all of its revenues denominated in us dollars we have an on going foreign exchange risk with respect to its canadian operations 
to help mitigate this risk  from time to time  we enter into various derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts  options  and collars 
the terms of these instruments are typically less than one year 
as of december   we had open foreign currency option contracts for c million at exchange rates ranging from to and million at an exchange rate of 
at december   we had no open forward currency contracts
