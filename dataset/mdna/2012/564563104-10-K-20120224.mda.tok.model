overview mantech is a leading provider of innovative technologies and solutions for mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community  departments of defense  state  homeland security  energy and justice  including the federal bureau of investigations fbi  the space community  and other us federal government customers 
we combine deep domain understanding and technical capability to deliver comprehensive it  systems engineering  technical and other services and solutions primarily in support of mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community and dod 
our broad set of services is generally deployed in custom combinations to best address the requirements of our customers long term programs 
they generally include the following solution sets that are aligned with the long term needs of our national security clients command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr lifecycle support  cyber security  global logistics support  intelligence counter intelligence support  information technology modernization and sustainment  systems engineering  and test and evaluation 
mantech supports major national missions  such as military readiness  terrorist threat detection  information security and border protection 
we derive revenues primarily from contracts with us government agencies that are focused on national security and as a result  funding for our programs is generally linked to trends in us government spending in the areas of defense  intelligence  homeland security and other federal agencies 
as it relates to the evolving terrorist threats and world events  the us government has continued to increase its overall defense  intelligence and homeland security budgets 
however  this trend may not continue due to the mounting deficit of the us government and public pressure to reduce us government spending 
see item a risk factors for more information 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from our customers in the intelligence community and the department of defense 
these customers include the office of the secretary of defense  the department of state  the department of homeland security  various intelligence agencies  federal intelligence and terrorism task forces  the us army  navy  air force and marine corps  and joint military commands 
we also provide solutions to federal government civilian agencies  including national aeronautics and space administration and patent and trademark office  as well as to state and local governments and commercial customers 
the following table shows revenues from each type of customer as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented 
year ended december  department of defense and intelligence agencies federal civilian agencies state agencies  international agencies and commercial entities total revenues we provide our services and solutions under three types of contracts time and materials  cost reimbursable  and fixed price 
our contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors  including our business strategies and federal government procurement objectives 
recently  our customers have increasingly procured our services under cost reimbursable contracts  rather than time and material contracts 
we expect this trend to continue during the following table shows revenues from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented 
year ended december  time and materials cost reimbursable fixed price total revenues time and materials contracts under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may be either greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of securities and exchange commission sec topic  revenue recognition  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts and lowest risk of financial loss 
fixed price contracts under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenues on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues are recognized as those products are delivered and accepted 
we derive a majority of our revenues from contracts directly with the us government or as a subcontractor to other providers of services to the us government 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenues for the following periods year ended december  prime contract revenues subcontract revenues total revenues several years ago  management decided to pursue a prime position on contracts by bidding as a prime and through the acquisition of companies holding a prime position on desired contract vehicles 
as a result  our prime contract revenues as a percentage of our total revenues has continued to increase since the primary driver of our increase in prime contract revenues in and is due to the strategic services sourcing s vehicle acquired with our acquisition of sti 
revenues substantially all of our revenues are derived from services and solutions provided to the federal government or to prime contractors supporting the federal government  including services provided by our employees  our subcontractors and through solutions that include third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate as a part of our overall solutions 
these requirements may vary from period to period depending on specific contract and client requirements 
since we earn higher profits from labor services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable items such as hardware and software purchases for clients  we seek to optimize our labor services on all of our engagements 
cost of services cost of services primarily includes direct costs incurred to provide our services and solutions to customers 
the most significant portion of these costs are direct labor costs  including salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees directly serving customers  in addition to the related management  facilities and infrastructure costs 
cost of services also includes other direct costs  such as the costs of subcontractors and outside consultants and third party materials  including hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the customer as part of an integrated solution 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenues to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party materials 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenues to increase 
changes in the mix of services and equipment provided under our contracts can result in variability in our contract margins 
as a result of our increasing percentage of work in which we are the prime contractor  our use of subcontractors has continued to increase in both and general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees not performing work directly for clients  and associated facilities costs 
among the functions covered by these costs are corporate business development  bid and proposal  contracts administration  finance and accounting  legal  corporate governance and executive and senior management 
in addition  we included stock based compensation  as well as depreciation and amortization expense related to the general and administrative function 
depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of computers  furniture and other equipment  the amortization of third party software we use internally  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
intangible assets include customer relationships and contract backlogs acquired in business combinations  and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest expense incurred or accrued under our outstanding borrowings  our senior secured notes and deferred financing charges 
interest income interest income is primarily from cash on hand and notes receivable 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated statements of income the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income and the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenues as well as the year over year change from december  to december  year ended december  year to year change to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars in thousands revenues cost of services general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other income expense  net income from operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in revenue growth of million came from organic growth due to contract awards and expansion on prime positions in our cisr support business  including the s contract vehicle 
our acquisitions of s is  mtcsc  trantech and wins contributed revenue growth of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our global logistic services contracts 
we expect growth in revenues in as a result of our recent acquisitions and recent and anticipated contract awards in the areas of cisr and cyber security 
however we recognize that the government has expressed its intention to decrease its budgets related to professional and technical services contracts in the coming years 
additionally  us combat troops withdrew from iraq at the end of and the united states secretary of defense has announced the planned withdrawal of us combat troops from afghanistan in cost of services cost of services increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase in cost of services was primarily due to our acquisitions and continued organic growth

we expect cost of services in fiscal year to increase consistent with our growth in revenue 
as a percentage of sales  we expect cost of services to increase in primarily due to our continued trend towards cost reimbursable type contracts  which tend to have lower profit margins  and continued high percentage of subcontractors 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to our acquisitions  higher bid and proposal expenses driven by a few large proposals  higher expenses for non recurring legal services related to a case in which the company is the plaintiff and stock based compensation expenses increased due to higher forfeitures in resulting from the resignation of the company s former chief operating officer 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively due to the leveraging of our general and administrative expense over a larger base 
we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in to remain relatively consistent with interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in interest expense is primarily related to our senior unsecured notes being outstanding for all of as compared to nine months of we incurred million of interest expense for the year ended december  related to our senior unsecured notes issued in april in  we expect our interest expense to vary depending on our cash on hand balances and the use of our credit facility for future acquisitions 
interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in other income expense  net other income was million for the year ended december   compared to other expense of million for the same period in the increase was due to the sale of our investment in netwitness corporation  which resulted in a gain of million for the year ended december  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in our effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively

revenue growth of million came from our cyber security related contracts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease due to lower procurement of materials on our contracts for installation  sustainment and repair of communication systems and heavily armored vehicles designed to counter or clear mines and improvised explosive devices ied  such as the route clearance family of vehicles supporting us army tank automotive armament command 
cost of services cost of services increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase in cost of services was primarily due to our acquisition of sti

borrowings under our revolving credit facility were used to finance the acquisition of sti 
the interest rate on the senior unsecured notes is higher than interest currently available to us under our revolving credit facility 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in there was increased average cash on hand  which generated interest income during the period

effects of inflation inflation and uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment  such as conditions in the financial markets  could impact our labor rates beyond the predetermined escalation factors 
however  we generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner to accommodate the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
under our time and materials contracts  labor rates are usually adjusted annually by predetermined escalation factors 
our cost reimbursable contracts automatically adjust for changes in cost 
under our fixed price contracts  we include a predetermined escalation factor  but generally  we have not been adversely affected by near term inflation 
purchases of equipments and materials directly for contracts are usually cost reimbursable 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary liquidity needs are the financing of acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and our revolving credit facility 
on december   the company s cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we were contingently liable under letters of credit totaling million  which reduces our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
the maximum available borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  was million 
at december   we had million outstanding of our senior unsecured notes 
generally  cash provided by operating activities is adequate to fund our operations 
due to fluctuations in our cash flows and the growth in our operations  it is necessary from time to time to increase borrowings under our revolving credit facility to meet cash demands 
cash flows from operating activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from operating activities our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
we bill most of our clients and prime contractors monthly after services are rendered 
increased cash flow from operations during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to increased receivables  depreciation expense and billing in excess of revenue earned primarily related to a contract to provide mobile telecommunication services in afghanistan  and net income  partially offset by the timing of vendor payables and decreased deferred income taxes 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso ratio  based on fourth quarter sales  was and at december  and  respectively 
the increase in our dso ratio was primarily due to a delay in payment on our largest contract related to new contract audit procedures on invoices by dcaa 
increased cash flows from operations for the year ended december  compared to the same period for was a result of the timing of vendor payments and accrued salaries  increased net income and amortization expense  partially offset by the timing of receivables 
cash flows from investing activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from investing activities our cash flow from investing activities consists primarily of business acquisitions  expenditures for equipment  leasehold improvements and software

capital resources we believe the capital resources available to us from cash on hand of million at december  and up to million in loan commitments under our revolving credit facility  and cash from our operations are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and to support the internal growth we expect to achieve for at least the next year 
we anticipate financing our external growth from acquisitions and our longer term internal growth through one or more of the following sources cash from operations  use of our revolving facility  additional senior unsecured notes  and additional borrowing or issuance of equity 
short term borrowings from time to time  we borrow funds against our revolving credit facility for working capital requirements and funding of operations  as well as acquisitions

revenue recognition and cost estimation we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a standard internal process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
our revenues consist primarily of services provided by our employees and the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with our customers 
cost of services consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
we derive the majority of our revenues from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price or time and materials contracts 
revenues for cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  that are subject to the provisions of asc  construction type and certain production type contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of sec topic  revenue recognition  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
for time and materials contracts  revenues are recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus materials and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenues are recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered or by other methods to measure services provided 
revenues from other long term fixed price contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts  specifically described in the scope section of asc  we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
the impact on revenues and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
both the individual changes in contract estimates and aggregate net changes in contract estimates recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting were not material to the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 
accounting for business combinations and goodwill the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets  financial assets and separately recognized intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have elected to perform this review annually during the second quarter of each calendar year 
no adjustments were necessary as a result of this review during the quarter end june  whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset may not be fully recoverable  we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows  without interest charges  will be less than carrying amount of assets 
if any impairment were indicated as a result of this review  we recognize a loss based on the amount by which that carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis
