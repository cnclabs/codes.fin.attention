overview for years  carter s has been one of the most recognized and trusted brand names in the children s apparel industry 
we also own the oshkosh brand  which over years has earned the position of a highly trusted and well known brand 
on june   we acquired bonnie togs  a canadian children s apparel retailer and a former international licensee 
specifically  the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of bonnie togs for total consideration of up to cad million  of which usd million was paid in cash at closing 
such payment is subject to post closing adjustments  which we expect to be finalized in the first quarter of fiscal the sellers may also be paid contingent consideration ranging from zero to cad million if the canadian business meets certain earnings targets for the period beginning july  and ending on june  sellers may receive a portion of the contingent consideration of up to cad million if interim earnings targets are met through june and june  respectively 
any such payments are not recoverable by the company in the event of any failure to meet overall targets 
as of july   the company had a discounted contingent consideration liability of approximately million based upon the high probability that bonnie togs will attain its earnings targets 
the fair value of the discounted contingent consideration liability as of december  was approximately million and is included in other long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the million change in the fair value of the liability is reflected as million in accretion expense and million in other comprehensive income resulting from a favorable foreign currency translation adjustment 
the company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration based upon a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis 
the company will continue to revalue the contingent consideration at each reporting date 
in light of the acquisition  the company reevaluated and realigned certain of its reportable segments 
as a result  the company s reportable segments include a new international segment reflecting our new canadian operations  our existing international wholesale business  and royalty income from our international licensees 
in addition  the company combined its historical mass channel segments with its wholesale segments 
the company believes these changes in segment reporting better reflect how its five business segments  carter s wholesale  carter s retail  oshkosh retail  oshkosh wholesale  and international  are managed and how each segment s performance is evaluated 
effective october   the company changed its segment presentation to reflect this new structure  and recast all prior periods presented to conform to the new presentation

our oshkosh and carter s brand names are also licensed through international licensing arrangements 
during fiscal  we earned approximately million in royalty income from these arrangements 
we source substantially all of our products through a network of vendors primarily in asia 
various sourcing agents coordinate this process  with one sourcing agent currently managing approximately of our inventory purchases 
our product costs  driven by inflation in significant component costs such as cotton  polyester  labor  fuel  and transportation increased substantially throughout fiscal and are expected to continue to remain at elevated levels for at least the first half of fiscal these cost increases have resulted in higher cost of goods sold and inventory values 
although we have raised our selling prices on many of our products  we have been unable to fully absorb these cost increases and our profitability was negatively impacted 
we do not expect in the near term to be able to fully absorb these elevated costs and our profitability may continue to be adversely impacted

these inflationary and currency risk factors have resulted in higher costs of goods sold and inventory values 
although we raised our selling prices on many of our products  we were unable to fully absorb these cost increases and our profitability was adversely impacted 
we do not expect in the near term to be able to fully absorb these inflated costs and our profitability may continue to be adversely impacted 
in recent years  the company has also experienced deflationary pressure on its selling prices  in part driven by intense price competition in the young children s apparel industry 
in this environment there is a risk that customers will not accept our price increases 
if the company is unable to effectively raise selling prices to help offset higher production costs  the adverse effect on our profitability may be even greater than anticipated 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability due to the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods  generally resulting in lower sales and gross profit in the first half of our fiscal year 
more of our consolidated net sales over the past five fiscal years  excluding the effect of the acquisition  have typically been generated in the second half of our fiscal year approximately 
accordingly  our results of operations during the first half of the year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those policies that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize wholesale and ecommerce revenue after shipment of products to customers  when title passes  when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
in the normal course of business  we grant certain accommodations and allowances to our wholesale customers to assist these customers with inventory clearance or promotions 
such amounts are reflected as a reduction of net sales and are recorded based upon agreements with customers  historical trends  and annual forecasts 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns and deductions 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments and other actual and estimated deductions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectability 
our credit and collections department reviews all other balances regularly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we contract with a third party service to provide us with the fair value of cooperative advertising arrangements entered into with certain of our major wholesale customers 
such fair value is determined based upon  among other factors  comparable market analysis for similar advertisements 
in accordance with accounting guidance on consideration given by a vendor to a customer reseller  we have included the fair value of these arrangements of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a component of selling  general  and administrative expenses on the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations rather than as a reduction of revenue 
amounts determined to be in excess of the fair value of these arrangements are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
inventory we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  additional write downs may be required 
goodwill and tradename as of december   we had approximately million in carter s and bonnie togs goodwill and million of aggregate value related to the carter s  oshkosh  and bonnie togs tradename assets 
the fair value of the carter s tradename was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis at the time of the acquisition of carter s  inc which was consummated on august  the particular discounted cash flow approach utilized the hypothetical cost savings that accrue as a result of our ownership of the tradename 
the fair value of the oshkosh tradename was estimated at its acquisition date  july   using an identical discounted cash flow analysis 
the carter s and oshkosh tradenames were determined to have indefinite lives 
the bonnie togs tradename was also estimated using an identical discounted cash flow analysis at the time of acquisition on june  the bonnie togs tradename was determined to have a definite life and is being amortized over two years 
the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinite lived tradename assets are subject to annual impairment reviews in accordance with accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets  as of the last day of each fiscal year 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances affecting our business 
factors affecting such impairment reviews include the continued market acceptance of our offered products and the development of new products 
we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of these assets  using assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount equal to that excess 
we perform impairment tests of our goodwill at our reporting unit level  which is consistent with our operating segments 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit 
the assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  as discussed above  in accordance with accounting guidance  we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed 
therefore  we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets even though realized actual cash flows are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 
accrued expenses accrued expenses for workers compensation  incentive compensation  health insurance  and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on actual commitments  statistical trends  and estimates based on projections and current expectations  and these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
loss contingencies we record accruals for various contingencies including legal exposures as they arise in the normal course of business 
in accordance with accounting guidance on contingencies  we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our internal and external counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal  and foreign 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting dates 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  associated interest is also recognized 
we also assess permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant  and equipment  stock based compensation expense  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations 
foreign currency the functional currency of the company s foreign operations is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
employee benefit plans we sponsor a defined contribution plan  a frozen defined benefit pension plan and other unfunded post retirement plans 
the defined benefit pension and post retirement plans require an actuarial valuation to determine plan obligations and related periodic costs 
we use independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
plan valuations require economic assumptions  including expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates to value plan obligations  employee demographic assumptions including mortality rates  and changes in health care costs 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are reflected as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or market value of assets are amortized to earnings over the estimated service life of the remaining plan participants 
significant assumptions used in valuing the company s net obligation under its oshkosh b gosh pension plan under which retirement benefits were frozen as of december  are expected long term rates of return on plans assets and the discount rate used to determine the plan s projected benefit obligation 
expected long term rates of return on plan assets were estimated to be for the fiscal year ended december  our strategy with regards to the investments in the pension plan is to earn a rate of return sufficient to fund all pension obligations as they arise 
the long term rate of return assumption considers current market trends  historical investment performance  and the portfolio mix of investments and has been set at for fiscal the discount rate used to determine the plan s projected benefit obligation was for the year ended december  this discount rate was used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows for benefit payments 
the rate used reflects the comparable long term rate of return on a pool of high quality fixed income investments 
any future obligations under our plan not funded from investment returns on plan assets will be funded from cash flows from operations 
the assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligations have a significant impact on the amounts recorded 
a change in the assumptions identified below would have had the following effects on the net pension expense and projected benefit obligation as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease dollars in millions discount rate return on plan assets discount rate return on plan assets net pension expense projected benefit obligation the most significant assumption used to determine the company s projected benefit obligation under its post retirement life and medical plan under which retirement benefits were frozen in is the discount rate used to determine the plan s projected benefit obligation 
a change in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase or decrease  as applicable  in the plan s projected benefit obligation of approximately million 
see note  employee benefits plans  to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further details on rates and assumptions 
stock based compensation arrangements the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of accounting guidance on share based payments 
the company adopted this guidance using the modified prospective application method of transition 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the following volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
the company uses actual monthly historical changes in the market value of our stock covering the expected life of stock options being valued 
an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense 
risk free interest rate this is the us treasury rate as of the grant date having a term equal to the expected term of the stock option 
an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
expected term this is the period of time over which the stock options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience and estimated future exercise behavior 
separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
an increase in the expected term will increase compensation expense 
dividend yield the company does not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense 
forfeitures the company estimates forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations 
the company accounts for its performance based awards in accordance with accounting guidance on share based payments and records stock based compensation expense over the vesting term of the awards that are expected to vest based on whether it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved 
the company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period for awards with performance criteria and adjusts stock based compensation expense based on its probability assessment 
forward looking statements statements contained herein that relate to our future performance  including  without limitation  statements with respect to our anticipated results of operations or level of business for fiscal or any other future period  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on current expectations only and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency and interest rate risks in the operation of our business  we have market risk exposures including those related to foreign currency risk and interest rates 
these risks and our strategies to manage our exposure to them are discussed below 
we contract for production with third parties primarily in asia 
while these contracts are stated in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and the local currencies of these contractors 
due to the number of currencies involved  we cannot quantify the potential impact of future currency fluctuations on net income loss in future years 
in order to manage this risk  we source products from over vendors in over countries  providing us with flexibility in our production should significant fluctuations occur between the united states dollar and various local currencies 
to date  such exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
transactions by our canadian subsidiary may be denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency  which is the canadian dollar 
fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar  may affect our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
our canadian subsidiary employs foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the procurement of us dollar denominated finished goods destined for the canadian market 
these foreign exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  which could result in earnings volatility 
our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our revolving credit facility  which carries variable interest rates 
as of december   our outstanding variable rate debt aggregated approximately million 
an increase or decrease of in the applicable rate would increase or decrease our annual interest cost by million and could have an adverse effect on our net income loss and cash flow 
other risks we enter into various purchase order commitments with our suppliers 
we can cancel these arrangements  although in some instances  we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation 
as we rely exclusively on our full package global sourcing network  we could incur more of these termination charges  which could increase our cost of goods sold and have a material impact on our business
