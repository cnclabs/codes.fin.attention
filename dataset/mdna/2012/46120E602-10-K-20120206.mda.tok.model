item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body 
however  the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to the patient  resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times  increased hospitalization costs and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery mis where mis is available 
over the past two decades  mis has reduced trauma to the patient by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions  often resulting in shorter recovery times  fewer complications and reduced hospitalization costs 
mis has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures  but it has not been widely adopted for complex reconstructive surgeries 
the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to extend the benefits of mis to many patients typically receiving open surgery by using computational  robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of conventional minimally invasive surgery 
surgeons operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a high resolution  d  hd image of the surgical field 
this immersive visualization connects the surgeon to the surgical field and their instruments 
while seated at the console  the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner  similar to the way he or she has been trained to do in open surgery 
our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist  while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon s hand 
in designing our products  we focus on making our technology easy to use 

table of contents our products fall into four broad categories da vinci surgical systems  insite and firefly fluorescence imaging systems  instruments and accessories eg  endowrist  endowrist one  single site and training technologies 
we have commercialized three generations of da vinci surgical systems  the first is our da vinci standard surgical system  first commercialized in  the second is our da vinci s surgical system  commercialized in and the third is our most current surgical system  da vinci si  commercialized in systems include a surgeon s console  imaging electronics  a patient size cart and computational hardware and software 
instruments and accessories are used with systems to allow surgeons flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed in a particular surgery 
lastly  training technologies include our recently developed da vinci skills simulator and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery 
we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy invasiveness 
here procedure efficacy is a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself 
when the patient value of robotic surgery is significantly higher than competing treatment options  we have seen that patients will seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer da vinci procedures 
market adoption occurs procedure by procedure  and is driven by the relative patient value of da vinci procedures compared to alternatives for the same disease state 
procedures the adoption of da vinci surgery has the potential to progress for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non da vinci alternatives 
we focus our organization and investments on developing  marketing and training those products and procedures where we believe da vinci can bring significant patient value relative to competitive therapies 
in  da vinci was used primarily in urology  gynecology  general surgery  cardiothoracic surgery and head and neck surgery 
target procedures in urology include da vinci prostatectomy dvp and da vinci partial nephrectomy 
target procedures in gynecology include da vinci hysterectomy dvh  da vinci myomectomy and da vinci sacral colpopexy 
target procedures in general surgery include da vinci colon resection 
in cardiothoracic surgery  they include da vinci lobectomy and da vinci mitral valve repair 
lastly  in head and neck surgery  they include da vinci trans oral robotic surgery tors 
in  approximately  surgical procedures were performed with the da vinci surgical system  up approximately compared to the growth in our overall procedure volume was driven primarily by da vinci hysterectomy dvh in the us  da vinci prostatectomy dvp outside the us and other urologic and gynecologic procedures including nephrectomy partial and full  sacralcolpopexy  myomectomy and endometriosis resection in the us emerging procedures within other specialties  including lobectomy for lung cancer and low anterior resection for colon cancer also contributed to procedure growth 
dvh is our highest volume procedure  having surpassed dvp in dvh procedure volume grew from approximately  cases in to approximately  cases in  of which approximately  were for the treatment of cancer and the remaining  related to benign conditions 
the very large majority of our dvh volume came from the us market  where we estimate the total annual addressable robotic market to be approximately  to  cases  of which approximately  are for cancer 
dvp procedure volume grew from approximately  cases in to approximately  cases worldwide in we estimate that the majority of the approximately  prostatectomies performed each year in the us are done robotically with the da vinci surgical system  as such  the us dvp growth rate was modest 
the majority of our worldwide dvp growth came from european markets  led by germany and france 
other procedures non dvh dvp grew over approximately in to approximately  cases 
growth in these other procedures was driven by da vinci adoption in urologic and gynecologic procedures such as da vinci partial nephrectomy and da vinci sacral colpopexy as well as early stage growth in other emerging procedures from other surgical specialties  including lobectomy for lung cancer  low anterior resection for colon 
table of contents cancer  and transoral robotic surgery tors for head and neck surgery 
while early results in emerging procedures are encouraging and may point to significant patient value  their growth is off of smaller absolute bases and their future growth rates are uncertain 
business model we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue  derived from sales of instruments  accessories  and service 
the da vinci surgical system generally sells for between million and million  depending upon configuration and geography  and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers 
we generate recurring revenue as our customers consume our endowrist instruments and accessory products used in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system 
endowrist instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery  at which point they are replaced 
we also generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service 
we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold 
these service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period  typically at an annual rate of approximately  to  per year  depending upon the configuration of the underlying system 
recurring revenue has grown at a rate equal to or faster than the rate of growth of system revenue 
recurring revenue increased from million  or of total revenue in to million  or of total revenue in to million  or of total revenue in the increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da vinci surgical systems 
we expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future 
the installed base of da vinci surgical systems has grown to  at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  we have a direct sales force in the united states and in europe  excluding spain  italy  greece and eastern european countries 
we utilize distributors in all other markets that we serve 
on january   we completed the acquisition of our korean distributor and began selling directly to korean customers 
the transaction is not material to our financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations 
regulatory activities we believe that we have obtained the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the united states and most of europe 
as we make additions to target procedures and introduce new products  we will continue to seek necessary clearances 
in november  we received regulatory shonin approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor  and welfare mhlw for our da vinci s system in japan 
since this regulatory approval we have sold systems into japan in and systems in these sales were primarily made to early adopters 
we are currently focusing our efforts on obtaining specific reimbursement for da vinci procedures in japan 
to date  we have not received reimbursement approval in japan 
if we are not successful in obtaining market authorization  certifications and adequate procedure reimbursements or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures  then the demand for our products in japan could be limited 
we have partnered with the experienced regulatory team from johnson johnson kk medical company japan in our japanese regulatory process and are continuing to work with them to transfer the responsibilities for regulatory support of our products in japan to our subsidiary  intuitive surgical kk we continue to partner with adachi co  ltd as our separate independent distribution partner in japan who is responsible for marketing  selling  and servicing our products in japan 
the march earthquake and tsunami in japan and their aftermath have created economic uncertainty that may disrupt economic activities in japan for a substantial period of time  including a reduction in hospital spending 
as a result  our sales in japan may be adversely affected 
given the relatively small proportion of our 
table of contents total revenue coming from japanese customers approximately of our global revenue in  we do not expect the overall impact on our revenues resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in japan to be material 
business events and trends economic environment 
during the first half of  the world wide economic recession curtailed capital purchases of our da vinci surgical systems 
beginning in the second half of through  the us economy has been recovering slowly 
demand for da vinci systems in europe has recovered more slowly than in the us european demand  driven by procedure growth  has been stronger and more consistent in the larger german  french  and italian markets 
demand in the smaller european economies has been more sporadic 
economic uncertainties within europe could adversely impact demand for our products 
demand for da vinci systems fluctuates quarter to quarter based upon changing economic and geopolitical factors 
da vinci si surgical system market acceptance 
in the second quarter of we launched our newest da vinci model  the da vinci si 
the da vinci si surgical system was fda approved and ce conformit europ enne marked upon launch and is currently available in most countries in europe and asia  excluding japan  among others 
da vinci si systems are available with an option to purchase a second console 
the da vinci s system can be upgraded to the da vinci si system  however  most customers have chosen to trade out their da vinci s systems rather than receiving component level field upgrades 
we continue to sell  service and support the da vinci s surgical system as well 
our sales of the standard da vinci surgical system have substantially ended  however  we continue to service and support this product line as well 
market acceptance of the da vinci si surgical system has been positive since its market introduction in the first quarter of during the years ended december  and december   out of and out of systems sold  respectively  were da vinci si models  representing approximately and  respectively  of system sales 
da vinci skills simulator 
in the first quarter of  we began shipping our da vinci skills simulator 
the simulator is a practice tool for the da vinci si surgical system that gives a user the opportunity to practice in his or her facility with the surgeon console controls 
the simulator incorporates three dimensional  physics based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment 
the user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console 
upon completion of a skills exercise  the simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task specific metrics 
the simulator is intended to augment  not replace  existing training programs for the da vinci si surgical system 
most da vinci skills simulators have been sold in connection with new da vinci si surgical system sales 
we sold da vinci skills simulators in the year ended december  da vinci single site instruments 
da vinci single site is a set of instruments and accessories that allow the da vinci si systems to work through a single incision rather than multiple incisions 
single incision surgery is intended to minimize trauma to patients by reducing the number of ports required to enter the body 
non robotic single incision surgery today is typically performed with modified laparoscopic instruments 
early clinical adoption of this manual technique has been mostly positive  however  physicians have reported that manual single incision surgery is technically and ergonomically challenging 
da vinci single site instruments and accessories were designed to address these issues 
in february we received the ce mark for our da vinci single site instrument kit and began selling these new products in europe 
the vast majority of da vinci single site procedures performed in europe to date have been cholecystectomies 
in december we received fda regulatory clearance to market our single site instrumentation in the united states for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures 
we are not able to predict whether or the extent to which da vinci single site will be adopted 
we also are not able to predict whether the fda will approve single site for use in other indications 
da vinci firefly fluorescence imaging 
in the first quarter of  we launched our new firefly fluorescence imaging product for use with the da vinci si surgical system in the us and europe 
this new 
table of contents imaging capability combines a fluorescent dye with a specialized da vinci camera head  endoscope and laser based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces to visualize critical anatomy 
our phased roll out of the firefly fluorescence imaging product is progressing  with its initial use targeted in partial nephrectomy procedures 
general surgeons are beginning to evaluate the value of fluorescence imaging in colorectal surgery to assess tissue perfusion 
endowrist one vessel sealer 
in december  we received fda clearance for the endowrist one vessel sealer 
the endowrist one vessel sealer is a wristed  single use instrument intended for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument 
this instrument enables da vinci si surgeons to fully control vessel sealing  while providing the benefits of da vinci surgery 
this instrument is designed to enhance surgical efficiency and autonomy in a variety of general surgery and gynecologic procedures 
we are not able to predict whether or the extent to which the encowrist one vessel sealer will be adopted 
other product introductions 
in the second quarter of  we released in the us and europe our new thoracic grasper and dissecting bipolar instruments 
in the us we also released a medium large clip applier 
these new instruments are targeted to enhance the da vinci system s surgical capability in emerging lobectomy and general surgery procedures 
we had also received the ce mark in the second quarter of and fda approval in the third quarter of for our new suction irrigation instrument  which is also designed to facilitate thoracic as well as general surgery and gynecologic procedures

table of contents instruments and accessories revenue increased to million for the year ended december   up compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was driven by an approximate increase in procedure volume and  to a lesser extent  higher initial instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with higher system unit sales and recently released instrument and accessory products  including the mm endoscope  thoracic grasper  firefly fluorescence imaging products  and da vinci single site instruments 
procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dvh and dvp being the largest drivers of growth 
utilization per installed system for the year ended december  also increased as compared with the year ended december  instrument and accessory list pricing remained unchanged from to systems revenue increased to million during the year ended december   up from million during the year ended december  primarily due to the sale of more systems in prior to the fourth quarter  transactions involving customers transitioning from da vinci s to a da vinci si surgical system were included in upgrade revenue and excluded from the system count 
the current treatment reflects the current nature of the higher priced transactions where customers are now shipped completely new da vinci si surgical systems in exchange for their used da vinci s surgical systems  rather than receiving component level field upgrades of their da vinci s units 
there were field upgrades of da vinci s surgical systems to da vinci si surgical systems during the first nine months of the average selling price asp of million was approximately equal the asp

a california tax law change enacted in february allows an elective single sales factor for state apportionment for taxable years beginning on or after january  we expect to benefit from the california single sales factor election for apportioning income for years and beyond 
as a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor  in accordance with asc  income taxes  we re measured our deferred tax assets in the first quarter of  taking into account the reversal pattern and the expected california tax rate under the elective single sales factor 
in addition  a valuation allowance of million was recorded against the california deferred tax assets as of december  because it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result of the reduction in california taxes under the single sales factor election 
the federal r d credit expired as of december   and it is uncertain whether it will be extended 
if the credit is extended by the us congress for the year  the associated tax benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the quarter in which the extension is granted
