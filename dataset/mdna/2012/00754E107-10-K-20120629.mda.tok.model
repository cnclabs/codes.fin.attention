these forward looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risks described in the risk factors sections and elsewhere in this filing 
except for our ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws  we do not intend to update you concerning any future revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
global economic conditions the credit markets and the financial services industry continue to experience a period of significant disruption characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions  increased volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and a significant level of intervention from the united states and other governments 
continued concerns about the current economic environment  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the global commercial and residential real estate markets and related mortgage markets and consumer confidence have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for most developed and emerging economies 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of capital and credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by uncertain credit markets and wider credit spreads 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies could restrict our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness  increase our costs of borrowing  limit our access to capital necessary to meet our liquidity needs and materially harm our operations or our ability to implement our business strategy

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain prior year balances have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation 
application of critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make certain judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
we use historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts could be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory cost adjustments  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  warranty costs  taxes and contingencies 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and or as areas most dependent on management s judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is derived principally from the sales of our products 
we recognize revenue when the basic criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
are met 
specifically  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  usually in the form of a purchase order  when shipment has occurred since title and risk of loss passes at that time  or when services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in terms of both credit worthiness of the customer and there are no post shipment obligations or uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
we sell certain of our products to customers with a product warranty that provides warranty repairs at no cost 
the length of the warranty term is one year from date of shipment 
we accrue the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
we do not provide price protection or a general right of return 
our return policy only permits product returns for warranty and non warranty repair or replacement and requires pre authorization by us prior to the return 
credit or discounts  which have been historically insignificant  may be given at our discretion and are recorded when and if determined 
we predominantly sell directly to original equipment manufacturers with a direct sales force with limited sales through representatives  var s and distributors 
distributor and var sales represented approximately of total revenue for the year ended march  significant terms and conditions of distributor agreements include fob source  net days payment terms  with no return and limited exchange rights  and no price protection 
since the product transfers title to the distributor at the time of shipment by us  the products are not considered inventory on consignment 
revenue is also derived from technology research and development contracts 
we recognize revenue from these contracts as services and or materials are provided 
impairment of long lived assets as of march  and march   our consolidated balance sheet included million in goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over amounts assigned to tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our business acquisitions 
goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset to our carrying amount  as defined 
this guidance requires a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have selected march as the date for our annual impairment test 
we continue to meet the criteria of operating in a single segment and having a single reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization plus a control premium 
market capitalization is determined by multiplying the shares outstanding on the assessment date by the average market price of our class a common stock over a day trading period before and a day trading period after each assessment date 
we use this day duration to remove inherent market fluctuations that may affect any individual closing price 
we believe that our market capitalization alone does not fully capture the fair value of our business as a whole  or the substantial value that an acquirer would obtain from its ability to obtain control of our business 
as such  in determining fair value  we add a control premium  which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be required to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies  direct operations and make decisions 
our valuation as of march  indicated there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value calculated as described above was million including a control premium of million  while our carrying value including goodwill was million 
as evidenced above  our stock price and control premium are significant factors in assessing our fair value for purposes of the goodwill impairment assessment 
our stock price can be affected by  among other things  changes in industry or market conditions  changes in our results of operations  and changes in our forecasts or market expectations relating to future results 
our stock price has fluctuated from a high of to a low of on an intra day basis during fiscal the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles and property and equipment  are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred relative to a given asset or assets 
impairment is deemed to have occurred if projected undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimated cash flows include our assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset  or group of assets used in conjunction with the specific asset  in operations 
the amount of the impairment loss recognized is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset  or asset group  over its then estimated fair value 
as a result of the current year operating loss  we performed an impairment evaluation and concluded that for the fiscal year ended march  there were no impairments of any amortizing intangibles or property and equipment expected based upon future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining estimated lives 
accounting for income taxes income tax provisions and benefits are made for taxes currently payable or refundable  and for deferred income taxes arising from future tax consequences of events that were recognized in the our financial statements or tax returns and tax credit carry forwards 
the effects of income taxes are measured based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in accordance with fasb guidance pertaining to accounting for income taxes 
as part our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent operating results and our forecasting process 
we forecast taxable income through our budgeting and planning process each year 
the process takes into account existing contracts  firm sales backlog  and projected sales based upon customer supplied forecasts of product purchases  resources needed to fulfill these customers requirements  and extraordinary expenses that may be part of long term initiatives to increase shareholder value through revenue growth and efficiency improvements leading to profit improvement 
we have substantial history  more than years in most cases  with our customers and markets on which our forecasts are based 
at march   we had net operating loss carry forwards nol s of approximately million for federal income tax purposes and million for michigan and california state income tax purposes that expire at various dates through fiscal year the tax laws related to the utilization of loss carry forwards are complex and the amount of the loss carry forward that will ultimately be available to offset future taxable income may be subject to annual limitations under internal revenue code irc section resulting from changes in the ownership of our common stock 
we performed an analysis to determine whether an ownership change under irc section had occurred 
the effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of the net operating loss carry forwards attributable to periods before the change 
as of march   we believe there are no limitations on the use of these federal nols 
at march   we had net deferred tax assets before consideration of a valuation allowance of approximately million  mainly consisting of net operating loss carry forwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we have determined that at this time it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized  primarily due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards before they expire based on the negative evidence of our recent years history of losses  including tax losses in two of the last three years and cumulative taxable losses over the past three years  outweighing the positive evidence of taxable income projections in future years 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or within the periods before nol carry forwards expire 
as of both march  and march   we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes 
the calculation of federal income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step involves evaluating the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step involves estimating and measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
our evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we have taken no tax positions which would require disclosure 
although the irs is not currently examining any of our income tax returns  tax years to remain open and are subject to examination 
inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost on a first in first out basis or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are reviewed throughout the year to assess whether a cost adjustment is required 
our review of slow moving and obsolete inventory begins with a listing of all inventory items which have not moved regularly within the past months 
in addition  any residual inventory  which is customer specific and remaining on hand at the time of contract completion  is included in the list 
the complete list of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reviewed by the production  engineering and or purchasing departments to identify items that can be utilized in the near future 
these items are then excluded from the analysis and the remaining amount of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then further assessed and a write down is recorded when warranted 
additionally  non cancelable open purchase orders for parts we are obligated to purchase where demand has been reduced may also be written down 
impairments for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price are also recorded 
the impairments established for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory create a new cost basis for those items 
the cost basis of these parts is not subsequently increased if the circumstances which led to the impairment change in the future 
if a product that had previously been impaired is subsequently sold  the amount of reduced cost basis is reflected as cost of goods sold 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march revenues we predominantly operate in one industry segment  light and radiation detection devices  and sell to five major markets including telecommunications  industrial sensing non destructive testing  military and aerospace  medical  and homeland security 
revenues by market consisted of the following year ended march  march  telecommunications industrial sensing ndt military aerospace medical homeland security total revenues our total revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of approximately  or  from revenues of million for fiscal three of our five market segments showed growth in fiscal relative to fiscal telecommunications sales were million  an increase of  or from fiscal this increase in our telecommunications revenues for fiscal was the result of our product development investment over the past few years and growth in the g and emerging g markets 
our telecommunications revenue in the fourth quarter decreased approximately million from the prior year fourth quarter and increased approximately  from the third quarter of the current year 
we saw sequential quarterly revenue improvement as some of our customers began to recover from the supply chain disruption caused by the flooding in thailand  although volumes have not returned to the levels experienced in the comparable quarter last year 
in addition  we are seeing price decreases in certain segments which reduced the revenue on a comparable basis 
industrial sensing ndt market revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from fiscal revenues of million 
our industrial sensing ndt revenue in the fourth quarter of the current year decreased  from the comparable prior year quarter 
these decreases are the result of lower revenue from several of our optosolutions customers 
revenues in this market during the fourth quarter of the current year also decreased approximately  or  from the third quarter of the current year as several industrial customers invested in terahertz research systems in our third quarter and similar sales did not occur in the fourth quarter 
military aerospace market revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from the comparable prior year revenues of million  due to timing on certain government development contracts 
our military aerospace market revenue in the fourth quarter of the current year increased  from the prior year fourth quarter due to timing of orders from our optosolution customers 
our military aerospace market revenues increased  from the third quarter of the current year 
this increase was attributable primarily to the increase in funding of a terahertz development contract 
medical market revenues increased  or to million from the prior year revenue of  our medical market revenue in the fourth quarter of the current year increased  from the prior year fourth quarter of  and increased  from the third quarter of the current year 
the increases were primarily a result of increased sales from existing customers in fiscal year homeland security revenues increased  from the prior year revenue of  although our homeland security market revenue in the fourth quarter of the current year increased  from the third quarter of the current year  our revenue decreased  or over the prior year fourth quarter 
all fluctuations were the result of the timing of revenues associated with the in q tel development contract 
we have completed the development phase of this contract and any revenues for our fiscal will be dependent on a follow on contract by in q tel  adoption by the transportation security administration of our terahertz based anomaly detectors in their security screening process or purchases from other entities to use our terahertz based anomaly detection screening system 
in looking out to next year  we believe telecom revenues in fy will be flat to slightly up for the year and heavily weighted to the second half 
we expect growth in the industrial ndt market in fiscal year driven by the increasing adoption of the of the terahertz products for use in process control and non destructive testing 
the military aerospace market is expected to be flat to down primarily driven by the wind down of worldwide conflicts and federal deficit reduction efforts curtailing defense spending 
we expect medical market revenues to grow in fiscal year our guidance does not include any meaningful homeland security revenue for fiscal year as our products are currently under evaluation by the tsa 
overall  we expect fiscal year to be one of transition as the telecom market recovers and thz adoption accelerates 
gross profit gross profit was million or of revenue  compared to the prior year of million of revenue  a decrease of  the lower gross profit rate was due primarily to lower gross margin percentage experienced on the thz and optosolutions products 
gross margin dollars have decreased because of lower sales volumes obtained in our optosolutions products 
gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million of revenue versus million of revenue during the prior year fourth quarter as price pressures in our hsor product line prior to implementation of cost reductions affected the dollars and rate 
we expect to complete cost reductions on our hsor products in the first half of fiscal to restore more normal margins in the second half of fiscal gross profit was million of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal and declined by approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  predominantly due to product mix and the hsor pricing pressures 
operating expenses research and development expenses r d our r d expenses increased approximately  or  over the prior year 
r d expenses of million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal were and of sales  respectively 
in fiscal  we increased headcount to develop the next generation g g hsor products  and accelerate thz application and market development 
these investments have allowed us to gain customer acceptance on these new products and move thz from the laboratory to promising applications in security  process control and non destructive testing 
sales and marketing expenses s m s m expenses increased  or to million of sales in fiscal compared to million of sales in fiscal the increased spending was spread equally between our three product lines including higher hsor commissions  increased optosolutions salespeople  and thz market development support 
general and administrative expenses g a g a expenses increased  to approximately million of sales for fiscal  as compared to million of sales for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of a new chief financial officer  related relocation and recruiting fees and stock compensation expense 
amortization expense decreased approximately  to million compared to the prior year of approximately million 
we use the cash flow amortization method on the majority of our intangible assets which results in a declining expense profile over the life of the assets 
financing and other income expense  net interest income for fiscal was approximately  the same as in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  primarily attributable to lower interest rates and reductions in debt obligations with certain related parties and the michigan economic development corporation 
for the year ended march   there was a reduction in the fair value of the warrant liability that triggered other income of  which compared to other expense of  for the year ended march  fasb guidance requires certain of our outstanding warrants to be recorded as a liability at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a monte carlo option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
the income of  related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability for fiscal is primarily due to the decrease in our stock price and declining contractual life 
during fiscal year  we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of  as a result of amending the picometrix notes  which did not reoccur in fiscal net loss for fiscal was million per share  as compared to net loss of million per share in fiscal  an increase in the loss of approximately  the increase in losses for the year were primarily attributable to the lower gross margin realized of  increased r d and sg a expenses of million  offset by lower interest expense of approximately  and a net reduction in non cash charges of million which includes lower amortization of intangibles of  a decrease in the fair value on our warrants causing a change in expense of million and no loss on debt extinguishments 
liquidity and capital resources at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from million as of march  as the proceeds from the equity offering in the fourth quarter of fiscal were used to pay down certain debt obligations including insider debt in fiscal cash generated from operating activities in fiscal were  offset by a reduction in cash from investing activities of  and a reduction in cash from financing activities of million 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended march  was the result of net cash provided by operations of  and by net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of  the net cash provided by operations included a net loss of million and non cash income of  for the change in the fair value of warrants  offset by non cash expenses of million from depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
the net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of  primarily resulted from a reduction in inventory offset by decreases in accounts payable as our production levels in fiscal were lower than the end of fiscal net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended march  was primarily the result of net cash provided by operations of million offset by net cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the net cash provided by operations included a net loss of million  offset by non cash expenses of million  including million from depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense  approximately  for the change in the fair value of warrant liability  and  from the loss on debt extinguishment 
the net use of cash for changes in operating assets and liabilities of million was primarily a result of higher revenues which increased accounts receivable by million  inventories by million and prepaid assets by  offset by increases in accounts payable of million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended march   consisting of capital expenditures of  and patent expenditures of  offset by the elimination of restricted cash of  required under the privatebank loan agreement 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended march  the amount consisted of capital expenditures of approximately million and patent expenditures of financing activities net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended march  the amount consisted of a net increase in bank debt of  offset by the payoff of related party debt of approximately million  and the reduction in medc msf debt of  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended march  the amount consisted of net proceeds from the sale of class a common stock of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and proceeds from the exercise of warrants of  these were partially offset by a net reduction in debt of million 
debt bank debt on september   we executed a loan agreement the privatebank loan agreement with the privatebank and trust company privatebank 
the initial privatebank loan agreement provided us with a term loan and a million line of credit 
on september   we entered into a fifth amendment to the privatebank loan agreement the fifth amendment which established a new million term loan and extended the existing million line of credit 
the term loan was to be repaid in monthly principal payments of  plus interest at prime plus  until maturity on october  the line of credit incurred interest at prime plus and any outstanding borrowings were due on september  the availability under the line of credit was determined by a calculation of a borrowing base that includes a percentage of accounts receivable and inventory 
the line of credit was guaranteed by each of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the term loan was secured by a security agreement among api  our subsidiaries and privatebank  pursuant to which privatebank received a first priority security interest in certain described assets 
the privatebank loan agreement contained financial covenants including minimum debt service coverage ratio  adjusted ebitda level  and net worth requirements  each as defined in the loan agreement 
on january   we entered into a loan and security agreement and such other documents which constitute the svb loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb and terminated the privatebank loan agreement by paying off the outstanding balances 
the terms of the svb loan agreement provide for a million line of credit with a million export import ex im sublimit at an interest rate that ranges from prime plus basis points on up to prime plus basis points depending on our liquidity ratio and adjusted six month rolling ebitda as defined in the svb loan agreement 
the svb loan agreement contains a covenant for an initial minimum six month rolling adjusted ebitda of negative  which reduces over time to as of april  there is also a minimum liquidity ratio of based on outstanding cash  receivables and debt as defined in the svb loan agreement 
the amount that can be drawn on the line of credit is subject to a formula based on our outstanding receivables and inventory 
in addition  the svb loan agreement provides for a million term loan with principal payable over three years in equal monthly installments and interest at a rate ranging from prime plus basis points to prime plus basis points dependent on our liquidity ratio and adjusted six month rolling ebitda as defined in the svb loan agreement 
under the svb loan agreement  we may prepay all  but not less than all  of the term loan by paying a prepayment premium equal to i of the amount outstanding if prepayment occurs before the first anniversary of the term loan  ii of the amount outstanding if prepayment occurs after the first  but before the second anniversary of the term loan  and iii of the amount outstanding if prepayment occurs after the second anniversary of the term loan 
in addition  if the term loan becomes due and payable because of the occurrence and continuance of an event of default as defined in the svb loan agreement  we will be required to pay a termination fee equal to of the amount outstanding 
the interest rate on the svb term loan and line of credit as of march  were and  respectively 
we had  outstanding on the svb line of credit with approximately million in additional borrowing capacity as of march  the ex im line of credit with svb is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries and all borrowings under the svb loan agreement are secured by a first priority security interest that we and our subsidiaries granted to svb over substantially all our respective assets 
as of march   we have been and expect to be in compliance with the related liquidity and adjusted ebitda covenant with svb 
the term of the svb term loan and line of credit is three years and two years  respectively  the latter of which can be extended by mutual consent 
total interest payments made to our bank lenders during the years ended march  and march  were approximately  and  respectively 
medc msf loans the michigan economic development corporation medc entered into two loan agreements with our subsidiary  picometrix  one in fiscal medc loan and one in fiscal medc loan 
both loans are unsecured 
the medc loan was issued in the original principal amount of  under the original terms of the medc loan  the interest rate was and interest accrued but unpaid through october would be added to then outstanding principal balance of the promissory note issued pursuant to the medc loan and the restated principal would be amortized over the remaining four years september  
effective september   the medc loan was amended and restated to change the start date of repayment of principal and interest from october to october during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began negotiations with the medc to further amend the medc loan promissory note 
we agreed with medc that the payment of restated principal and accrued interest was to be suspended until the negotiations were completed 
in may  we entered into a debt conversion agreement with the medc whereby the medc converted the accrued and unpaid interest as of november  totaling  into  unregistered shares of our class a common stock at a price per share of market value of the stock on the day of conversion 
in addition we granted the medc a put option to sell back to us the shares received pursuant to the debt conversion agreement in the event of a trigger event as defined in the debt conversion agreement 
in conjunction with the debt conversion agreement  we amended the medc loan promissory note to retroactively change the interest rate from to beginning in december  and to change the repayment terms of the outstanding principal and interest such that beginning in october  we were to repay the remaining principal and accrued interest on a monthly basis through maturity in november medc loan  which was assigned to the michigan strategic fund msf in june  was issued in the original principal amount of million 
under the original terms of the medc loan  the interest rate was and interest accrued  but unpaid in the first two years of this agreement was added to the then outstanding principal of the promissory note issued pursuant to the medc loan during the third year of this agreement  we were to pay interest on the restated principal of the promissory note until october  at which time we were to repay the restated principal over the remaining three years september  
effective january   the medc loan was amended and restated to change the start date of repayment of principal and interest from october to november and to extend the repayment period to october during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began negotiations with the medc to further amend the medc loan promissory note 
we agreed with medc that the payment of restated principal and accrued interest was to be suspended until the negotiations were completed 
in may  we entered into a debt conversion agreement with the medc whereby the medc transferred the medc loan promissory note to the msf which converted the accrued and unpaid interest as of october  totaling  into  unregistered shares of our class a common stock at a price per share of market value of the stock on the day of conversion 
in addition  we granted the msf a put option to sell back to us the shares received pursuant to the debt conversion agreement in the event of a trigger event as defined in the debt conversion agreement 
in conjunction with the debt conversion agreement  we amended the medc loan promissory note to retroactively change the interest rate from to beginning in november  and to change the repayment terms of the outstanding principal and interest such that beginning in july  we are to repay the remaining principal and accrued interest on a monthly basis through maturity in september we performed an assessment of the amendments made to the medc and msf loans during the second quarter of fiscal to determine whether or not the amendments constituted a troubled debt restructuring or a substantial modification in accordance with fasb guidance and concluded that the amendments did not constitute either a troubled debt restructuring or a substantial modification 
furthermore  we performed an assessment of the balance sheet classification of the common shares issued as part of the debt conversion agreements in light of the put options granted and determined that equity classification of the shares was appropriate since the trigger event related to the put option is considered to be in our control 
interest payments made to the medc msf were approximately  and  during the years ended march  and march   respectively 
related parties debt as a result of the acquisition of picotronix llc  we issued four year promissory notes the picometrix notes to robin risser  our coo  and steve williamson  our cto collectively  the note holders in the aggregate principal amount of  api had the option of prepaying the picometrix notes without penalty 
the maturity date of the picometrix notes was subsequently extended in a series of amendments 
in particular  on november   we and the note holders entered into the fifth amendment to the picometrix notes the fifth note amendment 
the fifth note amendment required us to pay the note holders a restructuring fee of  and extended the due dates for the remaining principal balance payments on the picometrix notes through in the aggregate amount of  september  as part of the fifth note amendment  the interest rate on the picometrix notes was increased from prime plus to prime plus  and interest was to be paid quarterly through the maturity date 
we received board approval to pay both the september  and december  principal payments on september  pursuant to the terms of the svb loan agreement  on january   we used  of the proceeds of the term loan to pay all indebtedness including accrued interest owed to the note holders 
interest payments made to related parties during the twelve month periods ended march  and march  were approximately  and  respectively 
in conjunction with the fifth note amendment  on november   we and the note holders entered into a security purchase agreement the spa  which was subsequently amended and restated on november  pursuant to the terms of the spa  we issued the note holders for an aggregate purchase price of   units comprised of i  shares of class a common stock and ii warrants the warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock at an exercise price of per share 
while the exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  such adjustment cannot reduce the exercise price below per share 
we performed an assessment of the fifth note amendment in the third quarter of fiscal and determined that the fifth note amendment constituted a substantial modification in accordance with fasb guidance as the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the fifth note amendment  combined with the fair value of the consideration given as part of the spa  was more than different than the present value of cash flows under the prior amendment to the picometrix notes 
as a result  we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of  during the third quarter of fiscal  which is equal to the  restructuring fee and the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the spa which was  at november  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the warrants 
we believe that current cash levels combined with cash generated from operations  our revolving line of credit and or additional debt or equity financing will be sufficient for our fiscal year 
summary of contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at march  contractual obligations payments due by period total fy fy fy fy later bank line of credit bank term loan long term medc loans subtotal balance sheet expected interest expense on current debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received the goods or services 
we enter into agreements with suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon agreements defining our material and services requirements 
although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or the performance of services 
off balance sheet arrangements at march  and march   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued updated guidance that modifies the manner in which the two step impairment test of goodwill is applied 
under the amendments in this update  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that it s carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if we conclude otherwise  then we are required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test prescribed by existing standards 
the updated guidance is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year ended march  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at march   most of our interest rate exposure is linked to the prime rate  subject to certain limitations  offset by interest that may be earned on our cash balances 
as such  we are at risk to the extent of changes in the prime rate that are not reflected in money market rates 
we do not believe that moderate changes in the prime rate will materially affect our operating results or financial condition 
all of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars 
at march   we were not at risk to foreign currency exchange fluctuations
