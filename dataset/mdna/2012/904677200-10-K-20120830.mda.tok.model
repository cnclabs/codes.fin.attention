item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of forward looking statements about the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company faces intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign yarn producers and importers of textile and apparel products 
the company competes not only against domestic and foreign yarn producers  but also against importers of foreign sourced fabric and apparel into the us and other countries in which the company does business 
the company anticipates that competitor expansions or new competition within these regions may lead to reduced industry utilization rates that could result in reduced gross profit margins for the company s products  which may materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the primary competitive factors in the textile industry include price  quality  product styling and differentiation  flexibility of production and finishing  delivery time and customer service 
the needs of particular customers and the characteristics of particular products determine the relative importance of these various factors 
because the company  and the supply chains in which the company operates  do not typically operate on the basis of long term contracts with textile and apparel customers  these competitive factors could cause the company s customers to rapidly shift to other producers 
a large number of the company s foreign competitors have significant competitive advantages  including lower labor costs  lower raw materials  government subsidies  and favorable currency exchange rates against the us dollar 
if any of these advantages increase  the company s products could become less competitive  and its sales and profits may decrease as a result 
in addition  while traditionally these foreign competitors have focused on commodity production  they are now increasingly focused on value added products  where the company continues to generate higher margins 
the company  and the supply chains in which the company operates  may not be able to continue to compete effectively with imported foreign made textile and apparel products  which would materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in brazil  petrosuape companhia petroquimica de pernambuco petrosuape  a subsidiary of petrobras petroleo brasileiro sa  a public oil company controlled by the brazilian government  is constructing a polyester manufacturing complex located in the northeast sector of the country 
petrosuape will produce pta  polyethylene terephthalate pet resin  poy and textured polyester 
once fully operational  the textured polyester operations of petrosuape will most likely be a significant competitor as the textured polyester operations of petrosuape are expected to have approximately twice the capacity of the company s subsidiary unifi do brasil 
petrosuape s textured polyester operation started limited production in july and is expected to be in full commercial production by late such significant capacity expansion may negatively affect the utilization rate of the synthetic textile filament market in brazil  thereby negatively impacting the operating results of unifi do brasil 
an increase of illegal transshipments of textile and apparel goods into the us could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
according to industry experts and trade associations  there has been a significant amount of illegal transshipments of apparel products into the us and such illegal transshipments continue to negatively impact the us textile market 
illegal transshipment involves circumventing duties by falsely claiming that textiles and apparel are a product of a particular country of origin or include yarn of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties or to receive benefits from regional free trade agreements  such as nafta and cafta 
if illegal transshipments are not monitored and enforcement is not effective  these shipments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as product demand flow shifts from a region or within a region the company could lose its cost competitiveness due to the location of its assets 
the company s polyester segment primarily manufactures its products in the us and el salvador 
the company s nylon segment primarily manufactures its products in the us and colombia 
the company s international segment primarily manufactures its products in brazil and has a sales office in china 
as product demand flow shifts from specific regions or within the regions in which the company does business  it could lose its cost competitiveness due to the location of its assets 
the company s operations may incur higher manufacturing  transportation and or raw material costs in its present operating locations than it could achieve should its operations be located in these new product demand centers 
this could adversely affect the competitiveness of the company s operations and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in the trade regulatory environment could weaken the company s competitive position dramatically and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a number of sectors of the textile industry in which the company sells its products  particularly apparel  hosiery and home furnishings  are subject to intense foreign competition 
other sectors of the textile industry in which the company sells its products may in the future become subject to more intense foreign competition 
there are currently a number of trade regulations and duties in place to protect the us textile industry against competition from low priced foreign producers  such as those in china and vietnam 
changes in such trade regulations and duties may make the company s products less attractive from a price standpoint than the goods of its competitors or the finished apparel products of a competitor in the supply chain  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  increased foreign capacity and imports that compete directly with the company s products could have a similar effect 
furthermore  one of the company s key business strategies is to expand the company s business within countries that are parties to free trade agreements with the us any relaxation of duties or other trade protections with respect to countries that are not parties to those free trade agreements could therefore decrease the importance of the trade agreements and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
during  the us government has engaged in numerous rounds of negotiations to forge a new transpacific partnership agreement tpp 
countries currently participating in the tpp negotiations include australia  brunei  chile  malaysia  new zealand  peru  singapore  and vietnam  with mexico and canada recently announcing their intention to join tpp 
immediate duty free treatment or the lack of a yarn forward rule of origin in the final tpp could adversely affect the us textile and apparel industries and western hemisphere supply chains 
in addition  increased transshipments and the lack of strong customs enforcement could further reduce the cost of foreign made products in the us and result in a tpp that could adversely affect the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company will require a significant amount of cash to service its indebtedness  fund capital expenditures and strategic initiatives  and continue to execute its deleveraging strategy  and its ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under its  senior secured credit facility the abl facility and a secured term loan in the initial aggregate principal amount of  term b loan 
the abl facility consists of a  revolving credit facility the abl revolver and a  term loan abl term loan 
the company s ability to make payments on its indebtedness  to fund planned capital expenditures and its strategic initiatives  as well as to execute its strategy to further reduce its outstanding indebtedness  will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
the business may not generate cash flows from operations  and future borrowings may not be available to the company in an amount sufficient to enable the company to pay its indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs 
if the company is not able to generate sufficient cash flow or borrowings  the company may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity  reduce or delay strategic initiatives or the planned reduction of its outstanding indebtedness  or seek to raise additional capital 
the company may not be able to implement one or more of these alternatives on terms that are acceptable or at all 
the terms of its existing or future debt agreements may restrict the company from adopting any of these alternatives 
the failure to generate sufficient cash flows or to achieve any of these alternatives could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
for additional information regarding the abl facility and term b loan  see footnote long term debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the company s substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition or restrict its ability to pursue certain business opportunities and take certain action 
the company currently maintains  and plans to maintain  outstanding balances under its abl facility and term b loan 
the terms of the company s outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the company 
these restrictions could limit or prohibit  among other things  its ability to incur and guarantee indebtedness or issue preferred stock  repay subordinated indebtedness prior to its stated maturity  pay dividends or make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase the company s stock  issue certain capital stock  make certain investments or acquisitions  create liens  sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into certain transactions with stockholders and affiliates  and restrict dividends  distributions  loans or other payments from its subsidiaries 
these restrictions  in turn  could have important consequences to the company s operations  including the restrictions imposed on the operation of its business may hinder its ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow its business  the company s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  the company must use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay interest on its indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to the company for operations and other purposes  the company s high level of indebtedness could place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that may have proportionately less debt  it may be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of its borrowings  including borrowings under its abl facility and term b loan  are at variable rates of interest  its cost of borrowing may increase  its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it operates may be limited  and its high level of indebtedness makes the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its business 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  prospects and ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness 
the company s deleveraging strategy could result in the company maintaining balances outstanding under its abl facility and decrease the company s excess borrowing availability  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its debt agreements 
on an ongoing basis  the company anticipates utilizing its liquidity to continue to reduce borrowings under its abl facility and term b loan 
the company expects to maintain a continuous balance outstanding under the abl facility and to hedge a substantial amount of the interest rate risk in order to ensure its interest savings as it executes its deleveraging strategy 
the company s abl facility and term b loan require the company to meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test if excess availability under the abl revolver falls below the greater of  or of maximum availability 
the execution of the company s may debt refinancing and the continuation of its deleveraging strategy may result in the company maintaining reduced levels of excess availability under the abl facility  but the company does not expect that the amount of borrowing will be to an extent that the fixed charge coverage ratio test applies 
if the company s availability under the abl revolver falls below the greater of  or of maximum availability  it may not be able to maintain the required fixed charge coverage ratio 
additionally  the abl facility restricts the company s ability to make certain distributions and investments should its borrowing capacity fall below certain thresholds 
these restrictions could limit the company s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet its capital needs 
the company may not be granted waivers or amendments to its abl facility or term b loan if for any reason the company is unable to meet its requirements 
the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the abl facility and term b loan 
an event of default under its debt agreements would permit some of its lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable 
such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
in addition  an event of default under its abl facility or term b loan would permit the company s lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the abl facility 
furthermore  if the company was unable to repay the amounts due and payable under its abl facility or term b loan  those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness and force the company into bankruptcy or liquidation 
in the event its lenders accelerate the repayment of its borrowings  the company and its guarantor subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness 
as a result of these restrictions  the company may be limited in how it conducts its business  unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns  or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities 
the significant price volatility of many of the company s raw materials and rising energy costs may result in increased production costs  which the company may not be able to pass on to its customers  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a significant portion of the company s raw materials and energy costs are derived from petroleum based chemicals 
the prices for petroleum and petroleum related products and energy costs are volatile and dependent on global supply and demand dynamics  including geo political risks 
additionally  inflation can have a long term impact as increasing costs of materials  labor and other costs such as utilities and fuel may impact the company s ability to maintain satisfactory margins 
while the company enters into raw material supply agreements from time to time  these agreements typically provide index pricing based on quoted feedstock market prices 
therefore  supply agreements provide only limited protection against price volatility 
while the company has at times in the past matched cost increases with corresponding product price increases  the company has not always been able to immediately raise product prices  and  ultimately  pass on underlying cost increases to its customers 
the company has in the past lost and expects that it may continue to lose  customers to its competitors as a result of price increases 
in addition  its competitors may be able to obtain raw materials at a lower cost due to market regulations that favor local producers  and certain other market regulations that favor the company over other producers may be amended or repealed 
additional raw material and energy cost increases as well as increases due to inflation that the company is not able to fully pass on to customers or the loss of a large number of customers to competitors as a result of price increases could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company depends upon limited sources for raw materials  and interruptions in supply could increase its costs of production and cause its operations to suffer 
the company depends on a limited number of third parties for certain raw material supplies  such as poy and chip 
although alternative sources of raw materials exist  the company may not continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies of such materials on acceptable terms  or at all  from other sources 
the company is dependent on nafta and cafta qualified suppliers of poy which in the future may experience interruptions or limitations in the supply of its raw materials  which would increase its product costs and could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these poy suppliers are also at risk with their raw material supply chains 
any disruption or curtailment in the supply of any of its raw materials could cause the company to reduce or cease its production in general or require the company to increase its pricing  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows 
the company is currently implementing various strategic business initiatives  and the success of the company s business will depend on its ability to effectively develop and implement these initiatives 
the company is currently developing and implementing various strategic business initiatives to improve the company s competitive advantage and profitability and enhance shareholder value 
these initiatives include the company s deleveraging strategy  expanding branded pva yarns and increasing the market penetration of repreve product offerings 
the development and implementation of these initiatives requires financial and management commitments outside of day to day operations 
these commitments could have a significant impact on the company s operations and profitability  particularly if the initiatives prove to be unsuccessful 
moreover  if the company is unable to implement an initiative in a timely manner  or if those initiatives turn out to be ineffective or are executed improperly  the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
failure to modernize the company s facilities and fund capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and net sales 
the company s operating results depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to introduce innovative products and applications and to continue to develop its production processes to be a competitive producer 
accordingly  to maintain its competitive position and its revenue base  the company must continually modernize its manufacturing processes  plants and equipment 
to the extent sources of funds are insufficient to meet its ongoing capital improvement requirements  the company would need to seek alternative sources of financing or curtail or delay capital spending plans 
the company may not be able to obtain the necessary financing when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company fails to make future capital improvements necessary to continue the modernization of its manufacturing operations and the reduction of its costs  its competitive position may suffer  and its net sales may decline 
a decline in general economic or political conditions and changes in consumer spending could cause the company s sales and profits to decline 
the company s products are used in the production of fabric primarily for the apparel  hosiery  home furnishing  automotive  industrial and other similar end use markets 
demand for furniture and durable goods  such as automobiles  is often affected significantly by economic conditions 
demand for a number of categories of apparel also tends to be tied to economic cycles and customer preference 
domestic demand for textile products therefore tends to vary with the business cycles of the us economy  as well as changes in global trade flows  and economic and political conditions 
the company has significant foreign operations and its results of operations may be adversely affected by the risks associated with doing business in foreign locations 
the company has operations in brazil  china  colombia and el salvador and participates in a joint venture in israel 
the company serves customers in canada  mexico  israel and various countries in europe  central america  south america  africa  and asia 
the company s foreign operations are subject to certain political  tax  economic and other uncertainties not encountered by its domestic operations that can materially impact the company s supply chains  or other aspects of its foreign operations 
the risks of international operations include trade barriers  duties  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  social and political unrest  general economic risks  required compliance with a variety of foreign laws  including tax laws  the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  taxes on distributions or deemed distributions to the company or any of its us subsidiaries  maintenance of minimum capital requirements and import and export controls 
if the company is unable to react favorably to any of these changing conditions  the company s results of operations and business could be adversely affected 
through its foreign operations  the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact period to period comparisons of its reported results 
additionally  the company operates in countries with foreign exchange controls 
these controls may limit its ability to repatriate funds from its international operations and joint ventures or otherwise convert local currencies into us dollars 
these limitations could adversely affect the company s ability to access cash from these operations 
as a result of recent legislation in brazil  unifi do brasil is expected to lose some or all economic incentives related to the purchase of imported yarn 
if unifi do brasil is unable to make up for the loss of these incentives through increases in its local manufacturing business  price increases and or efficiency gains  this could have a material adverse effect on unifi do brasil s and or the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the success of the company depends on the ability of its senior management team  as well as the company s ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the company s success is highly dependent on the abilities of its management team 
the management team must be able to effectively work together to successfully conduct the company s current operations  as well as implement the company s strategies 
the company currently does not have any employment agreements with its corporate officers and cannot assure investors that any of these individuals will remain with the company 
the company currently does not have life insurance policies on any of the members of the senior management team 
the failure to retain current key managers or key members of the design  product development  manufacturing  merchandising or marketing staff  or to hire additional qualified personnel for its operations could be detrimental to the company s operations and ability to execute its strategic business initiatives 
unforeseen or recurring operational problems at any of the company s facilities may cause significant lost production  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s manufacturing processes could be affected by operational problems that could impair its production capability 
disruptions at any of its facilities could be caused by maintenance outages  prolonged power failures or reductions  a breakdown  failure or substandard performance of any of its equipment  the effect of noncompliance with material environmental requirements or permits  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including railroad tracks  bridges  tunnels or roads  fires  floods  earthquakes or other catastrophic disasters  labor difficulties  or other operational problems 
any prolonged disruption in operations at any of its facilities could cause significant lost production  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the economic adjustment assistance to users of upland cotton may be discontinued  which could adversely affect the parkdale america llc joint venture and thereby the company s investment income and cash flows 
one of the company s joint ventures  parkdale america  llc pal  receives economic adjustment payments eap from the commodity credit corporation under the economic assistance program to users of upland cotton  subpart c of the farm bill 
the economic assistance received under this program must be used to acquire  construct  install  modernize  develop  convert or expand land  plant  buildings  equipment  or machinery directly attributable to the purpose of manufacturing upland cotton into eligible cotton products in the us should pal no longer meet the criteria to receive economic assistance under the program or should the program be discontinued  pal s business could be significantly impacted 
the company relies on accurate financial reporting information from pal  an entity that it does not control 
errors in pal s financial reporting could be material to the company and cause it to have to restate past financial statements 
the company has ownership interests in pal  which is an equity method investee that it does not control 
the company relies on accurate financial reporting information from pal for preparation of its quarterly and annual financial statements 
errors in the financial reporting information received by the company from pal could be material to the company and require it to have to restate past financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
such restatements  if they occur could have a material adverse effect on the company or the market price of its securities 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property rights  and the company s inability to enforce these rights could cause it to lose sales and any competitive advantage it has 
the company s success depends in part upon its ability to protect and preserve its rights in the trademarks and other intellectual property it owns or licenses  including its proprietary know how  methods and processes and intellectual property related to its repreve brand 
the company relies on the trademark  copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries  as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements  to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  the company may be unable to prevent third parties  employees or contractors from using its intellectual property without authorization  breaching any nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements with it  or independently developing technology that is similar to the company s property 
the use of the company s intellectual property by others without authorization may reduce any competitive advantage that it has developed  cause it to lose sales or otherwise harm its business 
the company has made and may continue to make investments in entities that it does not control 
the company has established joint ventures and made minority interest investments designed  among other things  to increase its vertical integration  increase efficiencies in its raw material procurement  manufacturing processes  marketing and distribution in the us and other markets 
the company s inability to control entities in which it invests may affect its ability to receive distributions from those entities or to fully implement its business plan 
the incurrence of debt or entry into other agreements by an entity not under its control may result in restrictions or prohibitions on that entity s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions 
even where these entities are not restricted by contract or by law from making distributions  the company may not be able to influence the occurrence or timing of such distributions 
in addition  if any of the other investors in these entities fails to observe its commitments  that entity may not be able to operate according to its business plan or the company may be required to increase its level of commitment 
if any of these events were to occur  its business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
because the company does not own a majority or maintain voting control of these entities  the company does not have the ability to control their policies  management or affairs 
the interests of persons who control these entities or partners may differ from the company s  and they may cause such entities to take actions which are not in the company s best interest 
if the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its partners in these entities  the company could lose its ability to operate in these areas which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

deleveraging strategy during the june quarter  the company successfully completed its comprehensive debt refinancing 
the refinancing allowed the company to extend the maturity profile of its indebtedness to may and will generate approximately  of annual interest expense savings 
in addition  the company believes that this new financing will provide the availability and flexibility needed to execute its strategic objectives 
raw materials polyester raw material costs for fiscal year averaged to cents per pound higher than fiscal year throughout most of fiscal year  and for the latter half of fiscal year  polyester raw material costs remained at their highest levels in over thirty years 
in addition  asian imported yarns have become more competitive and continued to place pressure on the company s commodity business as the us asia gap in polymer pricing averaged to cents per pound in fiscal year versus the to cents average per pound for the prior fiscal year period 
inventory destocking the company believes inventory in the us apparel supply chain reached elevated levels during the first quarter of the company s recently completed fiscal year  and producers and wholesalers reacted to the elevated inventory levels by curtailing purchases from august to december the company reacted by adjusting its production below its sales levels in order to reduce its on hand inventory units 
as a result of the company s actions  the production volume and per unit manufacturing costs in the company s polyester and nylon segments were negatively impacted during the first half of fiscal brazil the strengthening of the brazilian real during the first half of fiscal year began to negatively impact the competitiveness of the local apparel supply chain by making imports of competing fibers  garments and apparel more competitively priced 
the return of the real to more normalized levels during the second half of the fiscal year and the initiatives taken by the brazilian government to help support the domestic manufacturers have helped shift demand back to the domestic brazilian textile producers 
due to the long supply chain for the procurement of its raw materials  the company s brazilian business was negatively impacted by the cost of higher priced inventory flowing through the operation in the current fiscal year 
lower sales and production volume also caused unfavorable increases in production costs due to lower utilization rates as well as higher spending due to inflationary increases for employee costs and power 
strategy while the company continues to face a challenging operating environment caused by global competition across the supply chain  inflation in input costs and raw materials  and potential decreased demand caused by continuing weakness of the us and global economies  the company believes it has the appropriate strategies to succeed in such an environment 
the company continues to focus on its key strategies striving for continuous improvement across all operational and business processes  enriching its product mix by growing its higher margin pva product portfolio  increasing sales of yarns with regional rules of origin requirements  and continuing its strategic penetration in global growth markets  such as china  central america and brazil 
going forward  the company expects to continue its support of these strategies through investments in product and geographic growth opportunities and utilizing excess liquidity to continue its deleveraging strategy  with the goal of reducing leverage  prepaying its term b loan  and developing other strategies to enhance shareholder value 
company outlook the company expects operating profit improvements for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year due to anticipated higher sales volume from the lessening effect of the inventory destocking and signs of improvement in the company s key markets and gross margin improvement

recent accounting pronouncements there have been no newly issued or newly applicable accounting pronouncements that have  or are expected to have  a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those involving accounting estimates that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time and where different reasonable estimates or changes in the accounting estimate from quarter to quarter could materially impact the presentation of the financial statements 
the following discussion provides further information about accounting policies critical to the company and should be read in conjunction with footnote summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
receivables reserves 
an allowance for losses is provided for known and potential losses arising from yarn quality claims and for amounts owed by customers 
reserves for yarn quality claims are based on historical claim experience and known pending claims 
the collectability of accounts receivable is based on a combination of factors including the aging of accounts  historical write off experience  present economic conditions such as customer bankruptcy filings and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
since losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions  and the health of the textile industry  a significant level of judgment is required to arrive at the allowance for uncollectible accounts which is established based on percentages applied to accounts aged for certain periods of time  supplemented by specific reserves for certain customer accounts where collection is no longer certain 
establishing reserves for yarn claims and uncollectible accounts requires management judgment and estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions it uses to assess allowance for losses 
certain unexpected events such as a customer bankruptcy filing could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its accounts receivable loss reserves during the past three fiscal years 
a plus or minus change in its aged accounts receivable reserve percentages would not have been material to the company s financial statements for the past three years 
inventory reserves 
inventory reserves are established based on percentage markdowns applied to items aged for certain time periods 
specific reserves are established based on a determination of the obsolescence of the inventory and whether the inventory value exceeds amounts to be recovered through expected sales prices  less selling costs 
estimating sales prices  establishing markdown percentages and evaluating the condition of the inventories require judgments and estimates  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross margins 
the company uses current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of its markdown percentages and expected sales prices 
the company believes it is unlikely that differences in actual demand or selling prices from those projected by management would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years 
a plus or minus change in its aged inventory markdown percentages would not have been material to the company s financial statements for the past three years 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held for sale  an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value less costs to sell 
estimates are required to determine the fair value  the disposal costs and the time period to dispose of the assets 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
for assets held and used  impairment may occur if projected undiscounted cash flows are not adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets 
in such cases  additional analysis is conducted to determine the amount of loss to be recognized 
the impairment loss is determined as the amount the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value  measured by future discounted cash flows 
the analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and  where applicable  judgments associated with  among other factors  the appropriate discount rate 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of an asset s carrying value is based on several factors including  but not limited to  changes in business environment  a decline in operating cash flows or a decision to close a manufacturing facility 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events and general economic conditions 
impairment of investment in unconsolidated affiliates 
the company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the ability of an affiliate to sustain sufficient earnings and cash flows to justify its carrying value 
reductions in an affiliate s cash flows that are other than temporary and indicative of a loss of investment value are assessed for impairment purposes 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company determined there were no other than temporary impairments related to the carrying value of its investments 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company currently has a valuation allowance against certain of its net deferred tax assets in the us and foreign subsidiaries due to negative evidence concerning the realization of those deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences reverse 
management considers the scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback periods  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company reviews its estimates of future taxable income on a quarterly basis to assess if the need for a valuation allowance exists 
the company continually evaluates both positive and negative evidence to determine whether and when the valuation allowance  or a portion thereof  should be released 
a release of the valuation allowance could have a material effect on earnings in the period of release 
the valuation allowance as of june  was  management and the board s audit committee discussed the development  selection and disclosure of all of the critical accounting estimates described above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates  fluctuation in currency exchange rates and raw material and commodity risks which may adversely affect its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes nor is it a party to any leveraged financial instruments 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowing activities 
the company has borrowings under its abl revolver  an abl term loan and a term b loan  which all have variable rates of interest 
the company hedges a significant portion of its interest rate variability on its abl revolver and abl term loan using interest rate swaps 
as of june    of the company s  of debt obligations are hedged through interest rate swaps with the  outstanding under the term b loan subject to a libor floor of 
after giving effect to these arrangements  the company s sensitivity analysis shows that a basis point increase in the libor rate as of june  would result in an increase of in annual cash interest expense 
currency exchange rate risk the company conducts its business in various foreign countries and in various foreign currencies 
each of the company s operations may enter into transactions sales  purchases  or fixed purchase commitments  etc 
that are denominated in currencies other than the operation s functional currency and subject the company to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company may enter into forward currency contracts to hedge this exposure 
for sales transactions such as these  the company typically hedges to of the sales value of these orders by using forward currency contracts 
the maturity dates of the forward contracts are intended to match the anticipated collection dates of the receivables and as of june   the latest maturity date was in july the company may also enter into forward currency contracts to hedge its exposure for certain equipment or inventory purchase commitments 
as of june   the company does not have a significant amount of exposure related to forward currency contracts 
as of june   the company s subsidiaries outside the us  whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  held approximately of consolidated total assets 
the company does not enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge its net investment in its foreign operations

more information regarding the company s derivative financial instruments as of year end is provided in footnote derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
raw material and commodity risks a significant portion of the company s raw materials and energy costs are derived from petroleum based chemicals 
the prices for petroleum and petroleum related products and energy costs are volatile and dependent on global supply and demand dynamics  including certain geo political risks 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge its exposure to changes in these costs 
the costs of the primary raw materials that the company uses throughout all of its operations are generally traded on us dollar pricing and are purchased at market or at fixed prices that are established with individual vendors as part of the purchase process for quantities expected to be consumed in the ordinary course of business 
other risks the company is also exposed to political risk  including changing laws and regulations governing international trade such as quotas  tariffs and tax laws 
the degree of impact and the frequency of these events cannot be predicted 
market capitalization versus book value as of the end of fiscal year  the company s book value was per share 
during fiscal year  the company s shares of common stock traded at a high of and at a low of per share 
due to the disparity between the share values  the company periodically considers the recoverability of its assets and does not believe any of its assets to be impaired at this time
