item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled risk factors in part i item a of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview overview we are an innovative drug discovery and development company seeking to discover  develop and deliver to patients best in class medicines for difficult to treat diseases 
we combine proven scientific expertise with a passion for developing novel small molecule drugs that target emerging disease pathways 
our programs in the inhibition of the hedgehog pathway  the heat shock protein chaperone system  and phosphoinositide kinase are evidence of our innovative approach to drug discovery and development 
hedgehog pathway inhibitor program 
our lead product candidate is saridegib  also known as ipi  a novel  potent  oral molecule that inhibits the hedgehog pathway by binding to the smoothened receptor  a protein that plays a critical role in the malignant activation of the hedgehog pathway 
we believe that smoothened inhibition represents a significant opportunity for addressing a number of difficult to treat cancers by disrupting malignant activation of the hedgehog pathway through multiple  distinct mechanisms 
we are evaluating saridegib in a randomized  double blind phase clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of saridegib compared to placebo in approximately patients with metastatic or locally advanced  inoperable chondrosarcoma 
we believe this trial is the first and only randomized clinical trial being conducted in this indication 
we expect to complete enrollment in this trial in the second half of and to report data from this trial in the first half of in addition  we are actively enrolling patients in an exploratory phase clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of saridegib in patients with myelofibrosis 
we expect to report data from this trial in the second half of in january  we discontinued our randomized phase clinical trial evaluating saridegib in combination with gemcitabine  a chemotherapy  in patients with previously untreated  metastatic  pancreatic cancer  following a preliminary analysis of data showing a difference in survival favoring the placebo plus gemcitabine treatment group 
this difference in survival was due to a higher rate of progressive disease in the saridegib plus gemcitabine treatment group  and not a result of the safety profile of saridegib 
we expect to present final data from this trial after our analyses are complete 
mundipharma international corporation limited  or mundipharma  has commercialization rights outside of the united states for products arising out of our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program 
hsp inhibitor program 
retaspimycin hydrochloride hcl  also known as ipi  is a novel  potent and selective inhibitor of heat shock protein  or hsp cancer cells depend on hsp to maintain many proteins critical for cancer growth  proliferation and survival in a functional state 
certain anticancer therapies may enhance the dependency of cancer cells on hsp therefore  combining an hsp inhibitor with another anticancer therapy may enhance cancer cell killing 
retaspimycin hcl is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double blind phase clinical trial in combination with docetaxel  a chemotherapy  compared to placebo and docetaxel in approximately patients with second or third line non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  who are naive to docetaxel treatment and have a history of heavy smoking 
we expect to complete enrollment in this trial in the second half of and to report data from this trial in the second half of we are also enrolling patients in a phase b trial to explore the safety and efficacy of retaspimycin hcl in combination with everolimus  an mtor inhibitor  in nsclc patients with a kras mutation 
the objective of this phase b trial is to determine the recommended dose for the combination treatment and to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of retaspimycin hcl in combination with everolimus 
we expect to report top line data from this trial in the second half of we have worldwide development and commercialization rights for our hsp inhibitor program 

table of contents pik inhibitor program 
the phosphoinositide kinases  or piks  are a family of enzymes involved in key immune cell functions  including cell proliferation and survival  cell differentiation  and cellular trafficking 
pik delta and pik gamma  two isoforms of pik  play key roles in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
additionally  in certain hematologic malignancies  pik gamma and pik delta contribute to the survival and proliferation of cancer cells 
therefore  inhibition of pik delta and pikgamma may have therapeutic potential across a broad range of inflammatory diseases and hematologic malignancies 
our lead compound in this program is ipi  a potent  orally available inhibitor of pik delta and pik gamma 
in the second half of  we initiated two phase clinical trials of ipi the first phase trial of ipi is a double blind  randomized  placebo controlled study designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple escalating doses of ipi in healthy adult subjects 
the second phase trial is an open label  dose escalation study designed to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of ipi in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies 
following the determination of the maximum tolerated dose in the dose escalation phase of this study  we plan to conduct an expansion phase in patients with specific hematologic malignancies 
we expect to report data from both phase trials in the second half of and to commence phase development of ipi in inflammation in mundipharma has commercialization rights outside of the united states for products arising from our pik inhibitor program 
other programs 
in addition to our three clinical stage programs  we have several innovative projects in earlier stages of development  encompassing emerging targets in fields such as cancer metabolism  apoptosis and protein homeostasis 
through our internal discovery efforts  we also discovered ipi  a novel  orally available inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase  or faah 
it is believed that inhibition of faah may enable the body to bolster its own analgesic and anti inflammatory response  and may have applicability in a broad range of painful or inflammatory conditions 
we have licensed worldwide development and commercialization rights to our faah program to mundipharma and its independent associated company  purdue pharmaceutical products lp  or purdue 
strategic alliances mundipharma and purdue scope in november  we entered into a strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products 
the alliance is governed by strategic alliance agreements that we entered into with each of mundipharma and purdue 
the agreement with purdue is focused on the development and us commercialization of products targeting faah 
the agreement with mundipharma is focused on the development and commercialization outside of the united states of all products and product candidates covered by the alliance  including those targeting faah 
the alliance currently includes product candidates that inhibit or target the hedgehog pathway  faah  pik  and product candidates arising out of our early discovery projects in all disease fields that are conducted during a prescribed discovery period that runs through december  our hsp program is expressly excluded from the alliance 
mundipharma also has the option to include in the alliance certain products or product candidates that we may in license during the discovery period by paying us a prescribed percentage of the up front license fee or other acquisition cost  which percentage could be up to of such fee or cost  and by funding research and development costs in the same manner as products or product candidates arising out of our internal discovery programs  as described below 
if we in license any product or product candidate during the discovery period for which glp good laboratory practice toxicology studies have not been initiated  as we did with our pik inhibitor program in  such products are automatically included in the alliance just as if they arose out of our internal discovery projects 
we have responsibility and decision making authority for the development of all of our product candidates and performance of early discovery projects on a worldwide basis 
there are no joint steering or similar 
table of contents committees for the alliance 
except with respect to products targeting faah  for which mundipharma and purdue currently have global commercialization rights  and products for which mundipharma has opted out of development as described below  we will have the right and responsibility to market and sell products arising from the alliance in the united states and mundipharma will have the right and responsibility to market and sell products arising from the alliance outside of the united states 
other than pursuant to the strategic alliance agreements  neither we  purdue nor mundipharma may develop  manufacture or commercialize products that are directed to the same target or pathway as a product included in the strategic alliance  unless and until a party terminates its rights with respect to such products 
following entry into the strategic alliance agreements  we consider mundipharma  purdue and their respective associated entities to be related parties for financial reporting purposes because of their equity ownership in our company 
research and development funding for each alliance program other than faah  mundipharma is obligated to reimburse us for all research and development expenses we incur  up to an annual aggregate cap  until the later of december  and the commencement of the first phase clinical trial of a product candidate  which we refer to as the transition date 
the funding caps for the years ending december  and december  are million and million  respectively 
the funding caps for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the funding cap for the period between november  and december  was million 
we are obligated to fund any activities in excess of the annual funding cap ourselves  which we did in primarily as the result of costs associated with the licensing of our pik inhibitor program  and in primarily due to expanded clinical trial activities for saridegib and the commencement of clinical development of ipi after the transition date for each product candidate  we are obligated to share equally with mundipharma all research and development costs for such product candidate 
we are recognizing revenue for reimbursed research and development services we perform for mundipharma and purdue 
we recognized million  million and million in such revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in october  following the completion of the first phase clinical trial of ipi  mundipharma and purdue exercised their rights to assume all worldwide development and commercialization activities and to fund all subsequent research  development and commercialization expenses for products arising out of our faah program 
all expenses associated with activities we conduct related to the transition of the faah program to purdue and mundipharma are reimbursed by purdue and mundipharma  with such amounts not counting towards the annual funding cap 
we recognized million and million in revenue related to reimbursed research and development services for the transition of the faah program in the years ended december  and  respectively 
opt out and termination rights mundipharma has the right to opt out of any alliance program  except the hedgehog program  on an annual basis in november of each year 
in the event of an opt out decision  mundipharma would continue to provide funding for  in the aggregate  of our contractually budgeted research and development expenses for all programs included in the alliance for the calendar year following the date of such opt out  up to an annual cap 
this funding commitment for the year ending december  is million for our pik and early discovery programs 
mundipharma may next exercise its right to opt out of the hedgehog program in november mundipharma is obligated to fund the hedgehog program until it is required to make the decision to opt out or continue funding the program 
if mundipharma elects to opt out of participation in the hedgehog program in november  then mundipharma would be obligated to make an immediate payment of million to us  which we can use on any program in the alliance 
in addition  mundipharma would be obligated to reimburse us 
table of contents for up to million of additional expenses incurred during that are associated with the completion of phase clinical trials of saridegib that are ongoing at that time 
if mundipharma elects to continue participation in the hedgehog program in november  it would thereafter have the same annual opt out right  and one year residual funding obligation  that applies to the other alliance programs 
in addition  we and mundipharma each have the right to opt out of continued development of a product candidate after it has reached the transition date  with a one year tail funding obligation for of post transition date research and development expenses for the product candidate 
if a party exercises its right to opt out of the development of a product or product candidate after the transition date  the other party may elect to continue the development and assume responsibility for the worldwide commercialization of such product or product candidate  subject to the payment of a royalty 
each of the strategic alliance agreements expire when the parties thereto have no further obligations to each other thereunder 
either party may terminate the strategic alliance agreement to which it is a party on days prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the day notice period 
the agreements may also be terminated by mundipharma or purdue in the event of a change in control of infinity or in the event that  during the discovery period  either adelene perkins or julian adams is no longer a full time executive of infinity 
upon termination of either strategic alliance agreement by us or either mundipharma or purdue  either party to the other strategic alliance agreement may terminate that agreement 
royalties except with respect to products that have been in licensed by us following initiation of glp toxicology studies  for which no royalties will be payable between the parties  we are obligated to pay mundipharma a royalty on net sales of the commercialized products until such time as mundipharma has recovered all research and development expenses paid to us under the research program prior to the applicable transition date 
after such cost recovery  we are obligated to pay a tiered  to royalty on us net sales of those products 
for products in which mundipharma has opted out of development prior to the transition date  we are obligated to pay royalties of to of worldwide net sales as a function of the stage of development of the applicable product candidate at the time of opt out 
for products in which either party has opted out of development following the transition date  the commercializing party is obligated to pay the other party a royalty on net sales 
mundipharma is obligated to pay us a tiered  to royalty on annual net sales outside of the united states of each product arising out of the alliance  and purdue is obligated to pay us a tiered  to royalty on annual net sales of faah products in the united states 
royalties are payable until the later to occur of the expiration of specified patent rights and the expiration of non patent regulatory exclusivities in a country  provided that if royalties are payable solely on the basis of non patent regulatory exclusivity  each of the rates above is reduced by one half 
in addition  all royalties payable under the strategic alliance agreements  whether by us  mundipharma or purdue  are subject to reduction on account of third party royalty payments or patent litigation damages or settlements  with any such reductions capped at of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period 
securities purchase and line of credit agreements in connection with the entry into the strategic alliance agreements  we also entered into a securities purchase agreement and a line of credit agreement in november with purdue and its independent associated company  purdue pharma lp  or pplp 
in march  purdue assigned its interest under the line of credit agreement to pplp 
under the securities purchase agreement  we issued and sold in two separate closings an aggregate of six million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of six million shares of our common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
an equal number of securities were sold to each purchaser 

table of contents the line of credit agreement provided for the borrowing by us of one or more unsecured loans up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of million 
in november  we borrowed the full million available to us under the line of credit 
the loan matures and is payable in full  including principal and any accrued interest  on april   which we refer to as the maturity date  and will be subordinate to any senior indebtedness that we may incur 
the loan bears interest at a fluctuating rate set at the prime rate on the business day prior to the funding of the loan and is reset on the last business day of each month ending thereafter 
interest is compounded on each successive three month anniversary of the funding of the loan 
the loan may be prepaid without penalty or premium prior to the maturity date 
even if we prepay the loan  we do not have the ability to borrow under the line of credit agreement again 
we have certain rights to repay the loan in shares of our common stock 
the extension of the line of credit at an interest rate below our incremental borrowing rate represented the transfer of additional value to us in the arrangement 
as such  we recorded the fair value of the line of credit of million as a loan commitment asset  with the offset to deferred revenue  on our balance sheet in we began amortizing this asset to interest expense over the life of the loan arrangement  or years  on april  we recorded approximately million  million and million of related amortization expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 
upon drawing down the million under the line of credit agreement  we reclassified the loan commitment asset as a debt discount which reduced the debt on our balance sheet 
we are recording interest on the net amount borrowed using the effective interest method 
we recorded million of related interest expense in the year ended december  subsequent to the borrowing in november using an effective interest rate of 
we will owe approximately million in interest and principal at the maturity date  assuming the prime rate of interest remains at 
we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses to mundipharma and purdue  which consisted of the excess of the amount paid for the purchased shares over the closing market price on the day before the equity closings and the value of the loan commitment asset 
we determined that the rights and licenses did not have stand alone value  and we considered all of the obligations under the arrangement to be a single unit of accounting 
there is no obligation for us to repay the million  and we are recognizing this deferred revenue ratably over years  which is our estimated period of performance under the arrangement 
we periodically review this estimate and may make adjustments as facts and circumstances dictate 
we recognized million in such revenue in each of the years ended december   and millennium 
in july  we entered into a development and license agreement with intellikine  inc  or intellikine  under which we obtained rights to discover  develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products targeting the delta and or gamma isoforms of pik  including ipi in january  intellikine was acquired by takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda  acting through its millennium business unit 
we refer to our pik program licensor as millennium 
we paid millennium a million up front license fee 
the entirety of this fee was included as research and development expense in the year ended december   although million of this fee was paid in january in addition to developing ipi  we are seeking to identify additional novel delta  gamma and dual delta gamma specific inhibitors of pik for future development 
we are obligated to pay up to million in success based milestones for the development of two distinct product candidates  and up to million in success based milestones for the approval and commercialization of two distinct products 
in addition  we are obligated to pay millennium tiered royalties on net sales ranging from single digits to low teens upon successful commercialization of products licensed to us  which are payable until the later to occur of the expiration of specified patent rights and the expiration of non patent regulatory exclusivities in a country  subject to reduction in certain circumstances 
during  we paid millennium million in milestone payments associated with the initiation of two phase studies of ipi  which we recorded as research and development expense during the year 
under the agreement  we obtained rights to direct all development and commercialization activities worldwide for products arising from the agreement for all therapeutic indications 
for a product in which the first 
table of contents phase clinical trial conducted is in an oncology indication  which we refer to as an oncology product  millennium will have the option  at the end of phase clinical development and upon payment of an option fee  to convert its royalty interest in us sales into the right to share in of profits and losses on us development and commercialization  and to participate in up to of the detailing effort for these products in the united states 
mundipharma  pursuant to its strategic alliance agreement with us  has commercialization rights outside the united states for products arising out of our pik inhibitor program 
millennium may terminate its participation rights in any oncology product with months prior written notice to us  after which millennium s participation rights would revert back to the original milestone and royalty based payment structure  provided that millennium would not be entitled to receive royalty payments for net sales occurring prior to the termination date and certain specified milestone payments 
other than pursuant to the agreement  neither we nor millennium may research  develop or commercialize products directed to the delta and or gamma isoforms of pik which meet certain selectivity criteria  except that millennium may research  develop or commercialize such products that it was researching  developing or commercializing on its own or with a third party prior to its acquisition of intellikine 
the agreement expires when the parties have no further obligations to each other thereunder  unless earlier terminated 
either party may terminate the agreement on days prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the applicable notice period  provided that the notice period is reduced to days where the alleged breach is non payment 
additionally  millennium may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice if we or a related party bring an action challenging the validity of any of the licensed patents  provided that we have not withdrawn such action before the end of the day notice period 
we may terminate the agreement at any time upon days prior written notice provided after the end of the research term that is currently set to expire in july financial overview revenue all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  the reimbursement of research and development costs  contract service revenue and milestones payments received from our collaboration partners 
license fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the expected research and development period under our arrangement with mundipharma and purdue 
because our agreements with mundipharma and purdue also provide for funding for our research and development efforts  we recognize this cost reimbursement as revenue in the period earned in proportion to our forecasted total expenses as compared to the total research funding budget for the year 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales  research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  research and development reimbursement  milestone and other payments earned under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments that we earn upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
if we fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our financial statements  would be materially adversely affected 
research and development expense we are a drug discovery and development company 
our research and development expense primarily consists of the following compensation of personnel associated with research activities  clinical testing costs  including payments made to contract research organizations  
table of contents costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and materials  costs of manufacturing drug candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies  costs associated with the licensing of research and development programs  preclinical testing costs  including costs of toxicology studies  fees paid to external consultants  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs for collaboration partners to perform research activities  including development milestones for which a payment is due when achieved  depreciation of equipment  and allocated costs of facilities 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation of personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology infrastructure  corporate communications  corporate development  human resources and commercial functions 
other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expense also consists of the costs of maintaining our intellectual property portfolio 
other income and expense interest expense and other interest and investment income typically consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  net of interest expense  and amortization of warrants 
interest expense includes amortization of the loan commitment asset from purdue entities  net  from april through november when we drew down the full million loan available under the line of credit agreement 
interest expense also includes accrued interest on the loan  including amortization of the debt discount 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  assumptions in the valuation of stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
differences between actual and estimated results have not been material and are adjusted in the period they become known 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition to date  all of our revenue has been generated under research collaboration agreements 
the terms of these research collaboration agreements may include payment to us of non refundable  up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved  and or royalties on product sales 
on january   we adopted on a prospective basis a newly issued accounting standard related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we will apply this standard to new 
table of contents revenue arrangements or material modifications of existing revenue arrangements 
this standard eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon our best estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previous accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item was the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item was sold separately by the vendor 
under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  we recognize revenues from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is the research or development term 
we regularly consider whether events warrant a change in the estimated period of performance under an agreement 
such a change would cause us to modify the period of time over which we recognize revenue from the up front license fee on a prospective basis and would  in turn  result in changes in our quarterly and annual results 
we recognize research and development funding as earned over the period of effort as related research costs are incurred in proportion to our forecasted total expenses as compared to the total research funding budget for the year 
we recognize the impact of any change in forecasted total expenses as a change in accounting estimate 
on january   we adopted on a prospective basis a newly issued accounting standard related to the milestone method of revenue recognition 
we will apply this standard to new revenue arrangements or material modifications to existing revenue arrangements 
at the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments  we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone 
this evaluation includes an assessment of whether  the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  the consideration relates solely to past performance  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the clinical  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
we recognize revenues related to substantive milestones in full in the period in which the substantive milestone is achieved 
if a milestone payment is not considered substantive  we recognize the applicable milestone over the remaining period of performance 
our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue does not include potential milestone payments 
we will recognize royalty revenue  if any  based upon actual and estimated net sales by the licensee of licensed products in licensed territories  and in the period the sales occur 
we have not recognized any royalty revenue to date 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities  including salaries and benefits  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  materials and supplies  preclinical expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  stock based compensation expense  depreciation of equipment  contract services  and other outside expenses 
we also include as research and development expense up front license payments related to acquired technologies which have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative use 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
we are party to collaboration agreements in which we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of 
table of contents the collaborator  as well as one in which we reimburse the collaborator for work it has performed 
we record all appropriate expenses under our collaborations as research and development expense 
if the arrangement provides for reimbursement of research and development expenses  as is the case with our alliance with mundipharma and purdue  we record the reimbursement as revenue 
if the arrangement provides for us to reimburse the collaborator for research and development expenses or achieving a development milestone for which a payment is due  as is the case with our agreement with millennium  we record the reimbursement or the achievement of the development milestone as research and development expense 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with pharmaceutical development work and to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials and preclinical studies 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers  or if we over or under estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
we often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
our estimates of expenses in future periods may be over or under accrued 
stock based compensation we expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity compensation 
we use our judgment in determining the fair value of our equity instruments  including in selecting the inputs we use for the black scholes valuation model 
equity instrument valuation models are by their nature highly subjective 
any significant changes in any of our judgments  including those used to select the inputs for the black scholes valuation model  could have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity instruments granted and the associated compensation charge we record in our financial statements 
fair value measurements we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we determine fair value based on the assumptions market participants use when pricing the asset or liability 
we also use the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop these assumptions 
we value our available for sale securities utilizing third party pricing services 
the pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value  including benchmark yields  reportable trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  new issue data  monthly payment information and collateral performance 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other pricing sources  and confirming those securities trade in active markets 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standard update no 
 comprehensive income  or asu no 
 which will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the update does not change the items which 
table of contents must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 comprehensive income asu no 
 which deferred the adoption of changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
because this update only requires enhanced disclosure  the adoption of asu no 
and asu no 
will not impact our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended december   and  in thousands  together with the change in each item as a percentage 
change change revenue research and development expense general and administrative expense interest expense interest and investment income income from therapeutic discovery grants income from nih reimbursement income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program income tax benefit revenue our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance entered into with mundipharma and purdue in november  which includes million related to the transition of our faah program to mundipharma and purdue  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  which includes million related to the transition of our faah program to mundipharma and purdue  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
in the absence of any business development activities that generate revenue  we currently expect that all of our revenue in will be derived from reimbursed research and development services and amortization of deferred revenue under our alliance with purdue and mundipharma 

table of contents research and development expense research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   and of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of million in clinical expenses  an increase of million in pharmaceutical development expenses and an increase in million in consulting expenses as our hedgehog and pik programs have advanced  and million associated with the achievement of milestones for the initiation of two phase clinical trials in our pik program 
these increases were partially offset by an upfront fee of million to license our pik program  which was recorded as research and development expense during the year ended december  the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the million upfront fee to license our pik program and million of related reimbursement for research and development services performed by millennium  an increase of million in compensation and benefits  which was primarily driven by annual base salary increases and an increase in our contingent cash compensation program  an increase of million in clinical expenses associated with advancement of our hedgehog and faah programs  and an increase of million in consulting expenses primarily related to our hedgehog and faah programs 
we began to track and accumulate costs by major program starting on january  the following table sets forth our estimates of research and development expenses  by program  over the last three years and cumulatively from january  to december  these expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs  process development and manufacturing  preclinical toxicology studies  clinical trial costs and allocated costs of facilities 
from august through december  our hsp inhibitor program was conducted in collaboration with medimmune  a division of astrazeneca plc  or medimmune  and from august through november  our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program was conducted in collaboration with medimmune 
under this collaboration  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune 
pursuant to our cost sharing arrangement  reimbursable amounts from medimmune were credited to research and development expense  and the expenses for the hsp inhibitor and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs below include credits of approximately million in years prior to dollars in millions program year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  january  to december  hedgehog pathway inhibitor hsp chaperone inhibitor faah inhibitor pik inhibitor includes an upfront license fee of million in and million in development milestones in 
table of contents we expect expenses for our clinical development to increase if our programs successfully advance 
we do not believe that the historical costs associated with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs nor represent what any other future drug development program we initiate may cost 
due to the variability in the length of time and scope of activities necessary to develop a drug candidate and uncertainties related to cost estimates and our ability to obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total costs required to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our programs  the anticipated completion dates of these programs  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence  if at all  from the programs described above and any potential future product candidates 
there is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to successfully develop any drug candidates 
these risks include the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials that we are currently running or may commence in the future  the scope and rate of progress of our preclinical studies and other research and development activities  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights relating to our programs under development  the terms and timing of any strategic alliance  licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish in the future relating to our programs under development  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing clinical supplies of any product candidates  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of million in consulting expenses  principally related to early commercial development and corporate development activities  and an increase of million in patent expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which is primarily related to the transition of our executive chair to a non employee position during the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which was primarily driven by an increase in accrued amounts under our contingent cash compensation program as well as stock based compensation expense related to the transition of our executive chair to a non employee position  and 
table of contents an increase of million in patent expenses  principally related to the addition of our pik program 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in consulting expenses  principally related to a decrease in early commercial development activities 
interest expense interest expense increased for the years ended december  and compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of amortizing the loan commitment asset from purdue 
we expect interest expense in to be higher than in primarily due to our draw down of all available amounts under the million line of credit from purdue during november interest and investment income interest and investment income decreased in the years ended december  and as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower yields on our cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we expect interest and investment income in to be comparable to income from therapeutic discovery grants during the year ended december   we received tax grants aggregating million under the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project program for qualified expenses related to our hedgehog  hsp and faah programs 
income from nih reimbursement during the year ended december   we received million from the national institutes of health  or nih  relating to contract work performed by discovery partners international  inc from august through june we do not expect any such income in future periods 
income from residual funding of hsp program in december  we regained from medimmune worldwide development and commercialization rights under our hsp inhibitor program 
following reacquisition of the hsp program  medimmune remained obligated to fund an amount equivalent to its share of the hsp program costs for the ensuing six month period 
in january  we agreed with medimmune to settle the residual funding obligations through lump sum payments totaling million  which we recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program in the year ended december  income tax benefit during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million because an uncertain tax position we took in a prior year was no longer subject to examination due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
we realized an income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of this law contains a provision that permits companies to carry back certain or net operating losses for a period of up to five years and receive a benefit for prior tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources we have not generated any revenue from the sale of drugs to date  and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the next several years  if at all 
we have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities  interest on investments  license fees  expense reimbursement under our collaborations  milestone 
table of contents payments  contract service payments and debt to fund our operations 
our available for sale debt securities primarily trade in liquid markets  and the average days to maturity of our portfolio  as of december   is less than six months 
because our product candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain  we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether  or when  we may achieve profitability 
our significant capital resources are as follows in thousands december  december  cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities including long term working capital years ended december  cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above financing activities cash flows the principal use of cash in operating activities in all periods presented was our net spending on our research and development programs that is  investments in research and development that are not reimbursed by our strategic alliance partners 
currently  spending on all of our research and development programs other than our hsp program is reimbursed by purdue and mundipharma up to contractually specified annual caps  which were million in and million in we exceeded the contractually budgeted amount for both and due primarily to advancement in our hedgehog and pik programs 
other than the income from residual funding of million in  we have not been reimbursed for any of our investments in the hsp program since we reacquired the program from medimmune in december during the year ended december   we recorded million in research and development expense related to the up front license fee for our pik program 
during the year ended december   we paid million of this million fee and recorded the remaining million in accrued liabilities 
we paid the remaining million license fee during the year ended december  our cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  included a decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to the amortization of million to license revenue 
cash flows from operations in future periods can vary significantly due to the level of research and development reimbursement or future collaboration arrangements 
in november  we entered into a strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue and issued four million shares of our common stock to purdue and one of its independent associated companies for cash proceeds of million 
of this amount  the shares were recorded at million  which represents the fair market value of our issued common stock and recorded in our cash flows from financing activities  and million was accounted for as an up front license fee in deferred revenue and recorded in our cash flows from operating activities 
during january  we issued to purdue and one of its independent associated companies an aggregate of two million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to six million shares of our common stock for cash proceeds of million 
these securities were recorded at their fair value of million and reflected as cash flows from financing activities 
the balance of million was accounted for as an up front license fee in deferred revenue and recorded in our cash flows from operating activities 
during the year ended december   we collected all of our unbilled receivables from mundipharma  purdue and medimmune 

table of contents our investing activities for the years ended december   and included the purchase of and proceeds from maturities and sales of available for sale securities and purchases of property and equipment 
our investing activities for the year ended december  included million in purchases of available for sale securities  proceeds of million from maturities of available for sale securities and proceeds of million from sales of available for sale securities 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  of million primarily consisted of laboratory equipment and software 
our financing activities for the year ended december  includes borrowings of million on the line of credit made available to us by pplp on attractive terms 
the loan matures on april   which we refer to as the maturity date  and will be subordinate to any senior indebtedness that we may incur 
the loan bears interest  payable on the maturity date  at a fluctuating rate set at the prime rate on the business day prior to the funding of the loan and is on the last business day of each month ending thereafter 
interest is compounded on each successive three month anniversary of the funding of the loan 
the loan may be prepaid without penalty or premium prior to the maturity date  however  any prepayments made cannot be re borrowed 
we have certain rights to repay borrowed amounts in shares of our common stock as a share settled obligation 
we will need substantial additional funds to support our planned operations 
we are entitled to receive up to million and million in research and development funding under our strategic alliance with mundipharma for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the absence of additional funding or business development activities and based on our current operating plans  we expect that our current cash and investments  together with research and development funding from mundipharma are sufficient to fund our planned operations into we may  however  need to raise additional funds before that date if our research and development expenses exceed our current expectations  if we do not receive the payments we expect to receive from mundipharma and purdue  if we acquire a third party or if we acquire or license rights to additional drug candidates or new technologies from one or more third parties 
we may need to raise additional funds for other reasons  including if our drug candidates require more extensive clinical or preclinical testing than we currently expect  we advance more of our drug candidates than expected into costly later stage clinical trials  we advance more preclinical drug candidates than expected into early stage clinical trials  the cost of acquiring raw materials for  and of manufacturing  our drug candidates is higher than anticipated  we are required  or consider it advisable  to acquire or license intellectual property rights from one or more third parties  mundipharma or purdue elects to discontinue its participation in a partnered program  or we experience a loss in our investments due to general market conditions or other reasons 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings of equity or debt securities  but such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly in light of current market conditions 
in addition  the terms of our financings may be dilutive to  or otherwise adversely affect  holders of our common stock  and such terms may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or incur additional debt 
we may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties  or through project financing 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our product development programs 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations  excluding contingent milestone payments payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond long term debt  including interest software contract obligation operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations as of december   the prime rate was 
the principal amount is million 
the above table does not include contracts with contract research organizations as they are generally cancellable  with notice  at our option 
in addition  we have obligations to make milestone payments under our license agreement with millennium 
for a description of these obligations  please see our description of our license agreement with millennium under the heading strategic alliances millennium above 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are in money market funds  corporate obligations  and us government sponsored enterprise obligations 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december   as compared to an approximate  decrease as of december  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments 
our long term debt bears interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the prime rate  reset each month 
at the time of the borrowing  prime rate was 
a hypothetical increase in the prime rate on the outstanding debt amount as of december  would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  over the next twelve month period
