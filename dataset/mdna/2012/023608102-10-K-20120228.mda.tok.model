item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ameren executive summary operations during  ameren remained committed to providing its customers with safe  reliable  environmentally responsible and reasonably priced energy while at the same time enhancing value for our shareholders 
ameren missouri and ameren illinois seek to earn competitive returns on their investments by improving their regulatory frameworks and seeking rate increases as needed 
ameren s merchant generation business seeks to protect and enhance shareholder value by minimizing operating and capital spending during the current period of low power prices while advocating for regulatory policies and power market improvements that will lead to improved economics 
ameren is committed to allocating capital to projects that have an opportunity to earn a competitive return and to aligning its spending with regulatory outcomes and economic conditions 
there were several developments during and early that have the potential to improve the level or predictability of earned returns at ameren missouri and ameren illinois 
in january  ameren illinois elected to participate in the ieima s performance based formula ratemaking process for electric delivery service 
as a result  ameren illinois electric delivery service earnings in and beyond are expected to reflect performance based formula ratemaking  which will enable additional infrastructure investment and the creation of jobs 
the improved infrastructure will enhance reliability and provide customers with the energy usage options made possible by smart meters 
also in january  the icc approved an increase in annual ameren illinois revenues for natural gas delivery service 
in  ameren missouri received rate increases for its electric and natural gas businesses 
in february  ameren missouri filed an electric rate case with the mopsc seeking to recover its operating and capital costs and to earn a fair return on investments made to serve its customers 
in addition to that pending electric rate case  in january  ameren missouri filed its first request with the mopsc for approval of new and expanded energy efficiency programs along with a cost recovery mechanism under the meeia 
the meeia was designed to enable utilities to pursue cost effective energy efficiency programs by aligning the utility s financial incentives with those of its customers 
also  ferc is expected to issue an order on miso s proposal to establish a capacity market within the rto 
the miso proposal calls for the first annual capacity auction to be held in april for the june to may planning year 
ameren supports the miso proposal as well as miso s efforts to increase the amount of capacity that can be shared between miso and pjm 
ameren will continue to advocate for a multi year capacity construct to improve the functioning of power markets 
the creation of a miso capacity market would more accurately reflect the value of capacity  improve efficiency and reliability  and benefit customers over the long term 
the merchant generation segment expects its cash flows from operating activities to exceed capital expenditures in reflecting the benefit of its forward power sales and hedging programs as well as actions taken to reduce spending 
in early  there has been a sharp decline in forward power prices 
the decline in power prices is believed to be caused by factors such as declining natural gas prices and the stay of the csapr 
it is unclear when legal and regulatory uncertainties related to csapr will be resolved and when natural gas prices will recover 
as a result of the declining price of power  merchant generation and genco have revised their capital spending plans 
genco is decelerating construction of its newton energy center scrubber project  postponing installation until such time as the incremental investment necessary for completion is justified by visible market conditions 
in addition  aerg has removed from its five year capital expenditure plans the previously planned precipitator upgrades at its ed edwards energy center 
merchant generation believes these actions are the best path to achieving appropriate returns on incremental environmental investments during this period of low power prices 
these merchant generation actions will reduce capital needs by approximately million from through compared to prior plans 
genco will decelerate the newton scrubber project in a manner that preserves the value of the work commissioned to date 
genco has reduced its expected capital expenditures for the newton scrubber project to approximately million 
after  genco will perform minimal amounts of ongoing construction activities such that when the economics merit completing the newton scrubber project  the project can be completed in an orderly and cost effective manner 
ameren plans to significantly grow its investment in electric transmission assets  which are regulated by ferc 
ameren expects to invest a total of approximately billion in transmission projects over the five year period ending in of that total  ameren illinois expects to invest million in transmission projects that are focused on local load growth and reliability needs 
in december  miso approved the illinois rivers  spoon river  and mark twain projects 
atx and atxi s total investment in these three miso approved projects is expected to be more than billion through  with potential investment of approximately million from to in  atxi is moving forward with the line routing and siting process for the illinois rivers project 
earnings ameren reported net income of million  or per share  for compared with net income of million  or cents per share  in the main factor contributing to the increase in earnings in compared with was a reduction in goodwill  impairment and other charges of million  or per share 
the charges were the result of the mopsc s july disallowance of costs of enhancements related to the rebuilding of ameren missouri s taum sauk energy 
table of contents center in excess of amounts recovered from property insurance  as well as new environmental rules  the primary impact of which was genco s closure of the meredosia and hutsonville energy centers 
ameren s earnings also increased in  compared with  because of higher electric utility rates for ameren missouri and ameren illinois and lower interest expense 
offsetting factors included reduced electric margins in the merchant generation segment due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation related expenses  lower electric sales to native load utility customers due  in part  to summer temperatures that while warmer than normal  were below those of a very hot  unrealized net losses on mtm activity related to nonqualifying power hedges and fuel related contracts  and higher major storm repair expenses 
additionally  ameren recorded a charge to earnings associated with the voluntary separation offers to eligible ameren missouri and ameren services employees during the fourth quarter of liquidity cash flows from operations of billion were used to pay dividends to common stockholders of million and to fund capital expenditures of billion 
at december   ameren  on a consolidated basis  had available liquidity  in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities  of approximately billion  which was a million increase in the amount of available liquidity at december  capital spending from through  ameren s cumulative capital spending is projected to range between billion and billion 
much of this spending is at ameren s rate regulated utilities  including a total of approximately million at atx and atxi  in the aggregate  to invest in their electric transmission assets 
the merchant generation segment s capital spending is expected to be up to million  primarily for environmental compliance  from through the decision to make pollution control equipment investments in ameren s merchant generation segment depends on whether the expected future market price for power reflects the increased cost of environmental compliance 
general ameren  headquartered in st 
louis  missouri  is a public utility holding company under puhca  administered by ferc 
ameren s primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries 
ameren s subsidiaries are separate  independent legal entities with separate businesses  assets  and liabilities 
these subsidiaries operate  as the case may be  rate regulated electric generation  transmission  and distribution businesses  rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses  and merchant electric generation businesses in missouri and illinois 
dividends on ameren s common stock and the payment of other expenses by ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries 
ameren s principal subsidiaries are listed below 
see note summary of significant accounting policies under part ii  item  of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries 
ameren missouri operates a rate regulated electric generation  transmission and distribution business  and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in missouri 
ameren illinois operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in illinois 
aer consists of non rate regulated operations  including genco  aerg  marketing company and medina valley 
the medina valley energy center was sold in february genco operates a merchant electric generation business in illinois and holds an ownership interest in eei 
on october   ameren  cips  cilco  ip  aerg and aer completed a two step corporate internal reorganization 
the first step of the reorganization was the ameren illinois merger 
upon consummation of the ameren illinois merger  the separate legal existence of cilco and ip ended 
the second step of the reorganization involved the distribution of aerg stock from ameren illinois to ameren and the subsequent contribution by ameren of the aerg stock to aer 
the ameren illinois merger and the distribution of aerg stock were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control 
in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance  assets and liabilities transferred between entities under common control were accounted for at the historical cost basis of the common parent  ameren  as if the transfer had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented 
ameren s historical cost basis in ameren illinois included purchase accounting adjustments related to ameren s acquisition of cilcorp in ameren illinois accounted for the aerg distribution as a spinoff 
ameren illinois transferred aerg to ameren based on aerg s carrying value 
ameren illinois has segregated aerg s operating results and cash flows and presented them separately as discontinued operations in its consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of cash flows  respectively  for all periods presented prior to october   in this report 
for ameren s financial statements  aerg s results of operations remain classified as continuing operations 
see note corporate reorganization and discontinued operations under part ii  item  for additional information 
effective january   as part of an internal reorganization  aer transferred its stock ownership interest in eei to genco through a capital contribution 
the transfer of eei to genco was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control  whereby genco accounted for the transfer at the historical carrying value of the parent ameren as if the transfer had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented 
ameren s historical cost basis in eei included purchase 
table of contents accounting adjustments relating to ameren s acquisition of an additional ownership interest in eei in this transfer required genco s prior period financial statements to be retrospectively combined for all periods presented 
consequently  genco s prior period consolidated financial statements reflect eei as if it had been a subsidiary of genco 
ameren and genco consolidate eei for financial reporting purposes 
the financial statements of ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
all tabular dollar amounts are in millions  unless otherwise indicated 
in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  we present certain information in cents per share

results of operations earnings summary our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors 
weather  economic conditions  and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services 
our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations winter heating and summer cooling demands 
the vast majority of ameren s revenues are subject to state or federal regulation 
this regulation has a material impact on the price we charge for our services 
merchant generation sales are also subject to market conditions for power 
we principally use coal  nuclear fuel  natural gas  and oil for fuel in our operations 
the prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political environment  weather  supply and demand  and many other factors 
we have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for our illinois and missouri natural gas delivery service businesses  a purchased power cost recovery mechanism for our illinois electric delivery service business  and a fac for our missouri electric utility business 
fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs 
we employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business 
the reliability of our energy centers and transmission and distribution systems and the level of purchased power costs  operations and maintenance costs  and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of operations  financial position  and liquidity

genco the effective tax rate increased  after the impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge was excluded  primarily because of the change in tax treatment of retiree health care costs and changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions mitigated by the increased impact of state tax credits  internal revenue code section production activity deductions  and investment tax credit amortization on lower pretax book income 
income from discontinued operations  net of tax ameren illinois on october   ameren  cips  cilco  ip  aerg and aer completed a two step corporate internal reorganization 
the first step of the reorganization was the ameren illinois merger 
the second step of the reorganization involved the distribution of aerg stock from ameren illinois to ameren and the subsequent contribution by ameren of the aerg stock to aer 
ameren illinois determined that the operating results of aerg qualified for discontinued operations presentation 
we have therefore segregated aerg s operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented prior to october   in this report 
for ameren s financial statements  aerg s results of operation remain classified as continuing operations 
see note corporate reorganization and discontinued operations under part ii  item  of this report for additional information 
ameren illinois income from discontinued operations aerg decreased million in  compared with aerg s results of operations were included in ameren illinois consolidated statement of income for all periods prior to october  the inclusion of only nine months in contributed to the decrease in income from discontinued operations as well as a decrease in electric margins caused by lower realized revenue per megawatt sold and higher fuel and related transportation costs 
the decrease was partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense primarily caused by lower pretax book income 
liquidity and capital resources the tariff based gross margins of ameren s rate regulated utility operating companies continue to be a principal source of cash from operating activities for ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries 
a diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential  commercial  and industrial classes and a commodity mix of natural gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows for ameren  ameren missouri and ameren illinois 
for operating cash flows  genco  through marketing company  sells power through primarily market based contracts with wholesale and retail customers 
in addition to using cash flows from operating activities  the ameren companies use available cash  credit facility borrowings  commercial paper issuances  money pool borrowings  or other short term borrowings from affiliates to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements 
the ameren companies may reduce their credit facility or short term borrowings with cash from operations or  at their discretion  with long term borrowings or  in the case of ameren subsidiaries  with equity infusions from ameren 
the ameren companies expect to incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure to support overall system reliability and 
table of contents other improvements 
ameren intends to finance those capital expenditures and investments with a blend of equity and debt so that it maintains a capital structure in its rate regulated businesses of approximately to equity  assuming constructive regulatory environments 
ameren  ameren missouri and ameren illinois plan to implement their long term financing plans for debt  equity  or equity linked securities in order to finance their operations appropriately  meet scheduled debt maturities  and maintain financial strength and flexibility 
genco and the merchant generation segment seek to fund their operations internally and therefore seek not to rely on financing from ameren or external  third party sources 
genco and the merchant generation segment will continue to seek to defer capital and operating expenses  sell certain assets  and take other actions as necessary to fund their operations internally while maintaining safe and reliable operations 
under its indenture  genco may not borrow additional funds from external  third party sources if its interest coverage ratio is less than a specified minimum or its leverage ratio is greater than a specified maximum 
see note long term debt and equity financings under part ii  item  of this report for additional information on genco s indenture provisions 
based on projections as of december   of genco s operating results and cash flows  we expect that  by the end of the first quarter of  genco s interest coverage ratio will be less than the minimum ratio required for the company to borrow additional funds from external  third party sources 
genco s indenture does not restrict intercompany borrowings from ameren s non state regulated subsidiary money pool 
however  borrowings from the money pool are subject to ameren s control  and if a genco intercompany financing need were to arise  borrowings from the non state regulated subsidiary money pool by genco would be dependent on consideration by ameren of the facts and circumstances existing at that time

at december   the ameren companies were in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained within their credit agreements  indentures  and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants 
we consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows 
inability to raise capital on reasonable terms  particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets  could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses 
after assessing our current operating performance  liquidity  and credit ratings see credit ratings below  we believe that ameren and its rate regulated businesses will continue to have access to the capital markets 
however  events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited 
such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 
genco s operating results and operating cash flows are significantly affected by changes in market prices for power  which have significantly decreased over the past few years 
under the provisions of genco s indenture described in note long term debt and equity financings  in part ii  item of this report  genco may not borrow additional funds from external  third party sources if its interest coverage ratio is less than a specified minimum or its leverage ratio is greater than a specified maximum 
based on projections as of december   of genco s operating results and cash flows  we expect that  by the end of the first quarter of  genco s interest coverage ratio will be less than the minimum ratio required for the company to borrow additional funds from external  third party sources 
dividends ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling million  or per share  in  million  or per share  in  and million  or per share  in the payout rate based on net income in and was and  respectively 
the payout of common stock dividends exceeded net income in because of the noncash goodwill  impairment and other charges recorded during dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were in  in  and in the amount and timing of dividends payable on ameren s common stock are within the sole discretion of ameren s board of directors 
the board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends 
however  as it has done in the past  the board of directors is expected to consider various issues  including ameren s overall payout ratio  payout ratios of our peers  projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements  historical earnings and cash flow  projected earnings  impacts of regulatory orders or legislation  and other key business considerations 
on february   the board of directors of ameren declared a quarterly dividend on ameren s common stock of cents per share  payable on march   to stockholders of record on march  certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that  among other things  restrict the ameren companies payment of dividends in certain circumstances 
ameren illinois articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus 
genco s indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making dividend payments on its common stock 
specifically  genco cannot pay dividends on its common stock unless the company s actual interest coverage ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters and the 
table of contents interest coverage ratios projected by management for each of the subsequent four six month periods are greater than a specified minimum level 
based on projections as of december   of genco s operating results and cash flows in and  we did not believe that genco will achieve the minimum interest coverage ratio necessary to pay dividends on its common stock for the six months ended june   or the six months ended december  as a result  genco was restricted from paying dividends on its common stock as of december   and we expect genco will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock in   and see note long term debt and equity financings under part ii  item  of this report for additional information on genco s indenture provisions 
ameren missouri  ameren illinois and genco as well as certain other nonregistrant ameren subsidiaries are subject to section a of the federal power act  which makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public utility  as defined in the federal power act  to participate in the making or paying of any dividend from any funds properly included in capital account 
the meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the federal power act or ferc regulations 
however  ferc has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed  the dividends are not excessive  and there is no self dealing on the part of corporate officials 
at a minimum  ameren believes that dividends can be paid by its subsidiaries that are public utilities from net income and retained earnings 
in addition  under illinois law  ameren illinois may not pay any dividend on its stock unless  among other things  its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves  or unless ameren illinois has specific authorization from the icc

outlook ameren seeks to earn competitive returns on its investments in its businesses 
ameren missouri and ameren illinois are seeking to improve their regulatory frameworks and cost recovery mechanisms 
at the same time  ameren s rate regulated businesses are pursuing constructive regulatory outcomes within existing frameworks and are seeking to align their overall spending  both operating and capital  with economic conditions and cash flows provided by their regulators 
consequently  ameren s rate regulated businesses expect to narrow the historic gap between allowed and earned returns on equity 
ameren s merchant generation segment maintains a fleet of competitive coal fired and natural gas generating assets 
ameren s merchant generation strategy is to position itself as a low cost provider and to benefit from an expected future recovery of power prices 
ameren intends to allocate its capital resources to those business opportunities  including electric and natural gas transmission  that offer the most attractive risk adjusted return potential 
below are some key trends  events  and uncertainties that are reasonably likely to affect the ameren companies financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity as well as their ability to achieve strategic and financial objectives for and beyond 
rate regulated operations ameren s strategy for earning competitive returns on its rate regulated investments involves meeting customer energy needs in an efficient fashion  working to enhance regulatory frameworks  making timely and well supported rate filings  and aligning overall spending with those rate case outcomes  economic conditions and return opportunities 
the ieima  enacted late in  provides for a performance based formula ratemaking framework for electric delivery utilities in illinois 
on january   ameren illinois elected to participate in this regulatory framework by making its initial performance based formula rate filing with the icc 
we believe that our 
table of contents participation in this framework will better enable ameren illinois to earn its allowed return on equity for its electric delivery service business 
this is expected to give ameren illinois the earnings predictability to invest in modernizing its distribution system 
during  ameren illinois is required to make a one time million nonrecoverable donation to the illinois science and energy innovation trust 
additionally  ameren illinois is required to make an annual donation to that same trust and to fund customer assistance programs  both of which will total approximately million  in the aggregate  in as they continue to experience cost recovery pressures  ameren missouri and ameren illinois expect to regularly seek electric and natural gas rate increases and timely cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from their regulators 
these pressures include lower load growth from a weak economy  customer conservation efforts  and the impacts of energy efficiency programs  increased investments and expected future investments for environmental compliance  system reliability improvements  and new baseload capacity  including renewable requirements 
increased investments also result in higher depreciation and financing costs 
increased costs are also expected from rising employee benefit costs  higher property and income taxes  and higher insurance premiums as a result of insurance market conditions and loss experience  among other things 
following recommendations from the nrc s task force on lessons learned from the reactor accident in japan  the nrc is expected to issue orders in requiring united states nuclear plants to enhance nuclear plant readiness to safely manage severe events 
such orders are expected to result in increased costs or investments 
ameren s rate regulated businesses have procured rate increases 
in january  the icc issued an order that authorized a million increase in ameren illinois annual natural gas delivery service revenues 
this request was based on a future test year of  rather than a historical test year  in order to improve the ability to earn returns allowed by regulators 
in  ameren missouri received separate rate increases for its electric and natural gas businesses 
in january  the mopsc approved a stipulation and agreement that authorized an increase in annual natural gas delivery revenues of million 
in july  the mopsc issued an order approving an increase in annual revenues for electric service of million 
depreciation for the sioux scrubbers  previously deferred as a regulatory asset when placed in service in november  will result in an increase in annual expense of million  beginning in august in addition  capitalization of interest was discontinued in july the mopsc also issued an order  in april  with respect to its review of ameren missouri s fac for the period from march   to september  the order required ameren missouri to refund million  including million for interest  to customers related to earnings associated with certain long term partial requirements sales that were made by ameren missouri due to the loss of noranda s load caused by a severe ice storm in january ameren missouri has appealed this decision to the cole county circuit court 
the mopsc is currently conducting its fac review for periods after september it is possible that the mopsc could order additional refunds of million related to periods after september  and this could result in a charge to earnings 
ameren missouri filed a request with the mopsc in july for an accounting authority order that would allow ameren missouri to recover fixed costs totaling million that were not recovered as a result of the loss of load caused by the severe ice storm for potential recovery in a future electric rate case 
in january  ameren missouri made its initial filing under the meeia 
the meeia requires the mopsc to ensure that a utility s financial incentives are aligned with helping customers use energy more efficiently  to provide timely cost recovery  and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost effective energy efficiency programs 
ameren missouri s filing proposes a three year plan that includes a portfolio of energy efficiency programs along with a cost recovery mechanism 
if the proposal is approved  beginning in january  ameren missouri plans to invest million over three years in the proposed energy efficiency programs 
ameren missouri s second filing  made in february  was a request to increase its annual revenues for electric service by million  which includes recovery of the cost of the proposed energy efficiency programs included in the meeia filing 
a mopsc decision in ameren missouri s meeia filing is anticipated in the second quarter of  while an electric rate order is expected in december ameren and ameren missouri also are pursuing recovery from insurers  through litigation  for reimbursement of unpaid liability insurance claims for a december breach of the upper reservoir at ameren missouri s taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric energy center 
approximately employees of ameren missouri and ameren services accepted voluntary separation offers and left the company as of december  as a result of the voluntary separations  ameren and ameren missouri estimate an annual million reduction in operations and maintenance expense beginning in ameren missouri s callaway energy center completed a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage during the fourth quarter of ameren missouri s next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage is in the spring of during a scheduled outage  which occurs every months  maintenance and purchased power costs increase  and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases  versus non outage years 
ameren intends to allocate its capital to those investment opportunities with the highest expected 
table of contents risk adjusted returns 
ameren believes that because of its strategic location in the country  electric transmission may provide it with such an opportunity 
in december  miso approved three projects  which will be developed by atxi or atx 
the first project  illinois rivers  involves building a kilovolt line across the state of illinois  from the missouri border to the indiana border 
work on the first sections of this project will begin in  the expected in service date is the last section of this project is expected to be completed in the spoon river project in northwest illinois and the mark twain project in northeast missouri are the other two projects approved by miso in its current transmission expansion plan 
these two projects are expected to be completed in the estimated total investment in these three projects is expected to be more than billion 
ferc  in its order issued in may  approved transmission rate incentives for the illinois rivers project as well as for the big muddy project 
the big muddy project  located primarily in southern illinois  is currently being evaluated for inclusion in miso s transmission expansion plan 
during january  the weather conditions in ameren missouri s and ameren illinois service territories were unseasonably warm

merchant generation operations in this period of generally weak power prices  ameren is focused on improving and reducing the volatility of  operating cash flows within its merchant generation business so that cash flows from operations approximate required investments 
merchant generation has reduced operating costs and sought cost efficient methods to comply with significant environmental requirements 
merchant generation expects to continue to pursue these strategies while positioning themselves for an expected future recovery in power prices and margins 
as part of this strategy genco closed its meredosia and hutsonville energy centers at the end of  primarily because environmental investments expected to be required were not economical 
the closures and the retention of these energy centers emission allowances create flexibility to lower compliance costs at other merchant generation energy centers 
in addition  the closure of the hutsonville and meredosia energy centers is not expected to have a material impact on ameren s or genco s future earnings 
in  nearly all of merchant generation s margin was generated from sales of output from five baseload energy centers newton  joppa  coffeen  ed edwards  and duck creek 
the merchant generation segment expects to have available generation from its coal fired energy centers of million megawatthours in however  based on currently expected power prices  the merchant generation segment expects to generate approximately million genco million megawatthours of power in see note commitments and contingencies under part ii  item  of this report for further discussion of environmental matters and compliance plans 
power prices in the midwest affect the amount of revenues and cash flows merchant generation and genco can generate by marketing power into the wholesale and retail markets 
market prices for power have decreased over the past three years 
during  the market price for power for delivery in the current year has declined below levels because of factors such as declining natural gas prices and the stay of the csapr 
from december   through january   the market price for power at the indiana hub decreased by 
ameren s merchant generation segment and genco will be adversely impacted by the declining market price of power for any unhedged generation 
merchant generation and genco are currently evaluating this recent price decline and the impact of the stay of the csapr  and the potential impact these events may have on their operating and capital investment plans 
in  genco decelerated the construction of two scrubbers at its newton energy center  and aerg removed from its five year capital expenditures forecast previously planned precipitator upgrades at its ed edwards energy center 
based on current environmental rules and regulations  if merchant generation and genco do not complete these environmental upgrades by the beginning of  merchant generation and genco may need to reduce generation output at their energy centers to reduce emissions 
merchant generation and genco will also evaluate whether the decline in the market price for power in the first quarter of  and any changes to operating and capital plans  is indicative that the carrying value of its energy centers may not be recoverable 
a failure to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows  an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results and cash flows  or a reduction in the expected useful lives of merchant generation s energy centers could result in the recognition of long lived asset impairment charges 
merchant generation s energy centers without pollution control equipment are most exposed to declining power prices as compliance options for environmental laws and regulations could become prohibitively expensive 
to reduce cash flow volatility  marketing company  through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts  targets to hedge merchant generation s expected output by to for the following year  to 
table of contents for two years out  and to for three years out 
as of january   marketing company had hedged approximately million megawatthours of merchant generation s expected generation for  at an average price of per megawatthour 
for  marketing company had hedged approximately million megawatthours of merchant generation s forecasted generation sales at an average price of per megawatthour 
for  marketing company had hedged approximately million megawatthours of merchant generation s forecasted generation sales at an average price of per megawatthour 
any unhedged forecasted generation will be exposed to market prices at the time of sale 
as a result  any new physical or financial power sales may be at price levels lower than previously experienced and lower than the value of existing hedged sales 
merchant generation is also supporting development of an energy capacity market within miso  which is expected to support longer term investment 
ferc is expected to issue an order on miso s proposal to establish a capacity market within the rto 
the miso proposal calls for the first annual capacity auction to be held in april for the june to may planning year 
to further reduce cash flow volatility  merchant generation seeks to hedge fuel costs consistent with power sales 
as of january   for merchant generation had hedged fuel costs for approximately million megawatthours of coal and up to million megawatthours of base transportation at about per megawatthour 
for  merchant generation had hedged fuel costs for approximately million megawatthours of coal and up to million megawatthours of base transportation at about per megawatthour 
for  merchant generation had hedged fuel costs for approximately million megawatthours of coal and up to million megawatthours of base transportation at about per megawatthour 
in  genco and the merchant generation segment are targeting a reduction in coal inventories 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for through liquidity and capital resources the ameren companies seek to maintain access to the capital markets at commercially attractive rates in order to fund their businesses 
the enhancement of regulatory frameworks and returns is expected to improve cash flows  credit metrics  and related access to capital for ameren s rate regulated businesses 
genco and the merchant generation segment seek to fund their operations internally and therefore seek not to rely on financing from ameren or external  third party sources 
genco and the merchant generation segment will continue to seek to defer capital and operating expenses  sell certain assets  and take other actions as necessary to fund their operations internally while maintaining safe and reliable operations 
under its indenture  genco may not borrow additional funds from external  third party sources if its interest coverage ratio is less than a specified minimum or its leverage ratio is greater than a specified maximum 
based on projections as of december   of genco s operating results and cash flows  we expect that  by the end of the first quarter of  genco s interest coverage ratio will be less than the minimum ratio required for the company to borrow additional funds from external  third party sources 
genco s indenture does not restrict intercompany borrowings from ameren s non state regulated subsidiary money pool 
however  borrowings from the money pool are subject to ameren s control  and if a genco intercompany financing need were to arise  borrowings from the non state regulated subsidiary money pool by genco would be dependent on consideration by ameren of the facts and circumstances existing at that time 
the ameren companies have also entered into multiyear credit facility agreements that cumulatively provide billion of credit through september  we believe that our liquidity is adequate given our expected operating cash flows  capital expenditures  and related financing plans

as of december   ameren had approximately million in federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards ameren missouri million  ameren illinois million  genco million and million in federal income tax credit carryforwards ameren missouri million  ameren illinois million  genco million 
these carryforwards are expected to satisfy income tax liabilities through the end of ameren missouri  ameren illinois  genco between and  ameren currently expects to invest between billion to billion to retrofit its coal fired energy centers with pollution control equipment in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
any pollution control investments will result in decreased energy center availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses 
any pollution control investments at ameren missouri are expected to be recoverable from ratepayers  subject to prudence reviews 
regulatory lag may materially affect the timing of such recovery and returns on the investments  and therefore affect our cash flows and related financing needs 
the recoverability of amounts expended in our merchant generation segment will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for coal fired generators

accounting matters critical accounting estimates preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates 
these estimates involve judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures 
we have outlined below the critical accounting estimates that we believe are most difficult  subjective  or complex 
any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters  among others  could have a material impact on future financial results

determining whether or not a contract qualifies as a derivative under authoritative accounting guidance requires us to exercise significant judgment in interpreting the definition of a derivative and applying that definition 
authoritative accounting guidance regarding derivative instruments requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values  unless the npns exception applies 
we determine whether to exclude the fair value of certain derivatives from valuation under the npns provisions of authoritative accounting guidance after assessing our intent and ability to physically deliver commodities purchased and sold 
further  our forecasted purchases and sales also support our designation of some fair valued derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
fair value of our derivatives is measured in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance  which provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques 
we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
when we do not have observable inputs  we use certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation 
our valuations also reflect our own assessment of counterparty default risk  guided by the best internal and external information available 
if we were required to discontinue our use of the npns exception or cash flow hedge treatment for some of our contracts  the impact of changes in fair value for the applicable contracts could be material to our earnings and financial position 
valuation of long lived assets and asset retirement obligations we periodically assess the carrying value of our long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired 
we also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations

effects of inflation and changing prices ameren s rates for retail electric and natural gas utility service are regulated by the mopsc and the icc 
nonretail electric rates are regulated by ferc 
rate regulation is generally based on the recovery of historical or projected costs 
as a result  revenue increases could lag behind changing prices 
ameren illinois has recently elected to participate in the performance based formula ratemaking process for determining retail rates for its electric delivery service business established by the ieima 
ameren illinois participation in this formula ratemaking process will terminate if the average residential rate increases by more than annually from june through may the average residential rate includes generation service  which is outside of ameren illinois control as it is required to purchase all of its power through procurement processes administered by the ipa 
the cost of procured power can be affected by inflation 
within that formula  the monthly average yields of year united states treasury bonds are the basis for ameren illinois return on equity 
therefore  pending icc approval of ameren illinois initial filing under the ieima  which is expected to occur in october  there will be a direct correlation between the yield of united states treasury bonds  which are affected by inflation  and the earnings of ameren illinois electric distribution business 
inflation affects our operations  earnings  stockholders equity  and financial performance 

table of contents the current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost 
under existing regulatory practice  only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers 
as a result  cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years 
ameren s merchant generation business does not have regulated recovery mechanisms and is therefore dependent on market prices for power to reflect rising costs 
ameren missouri recovers the cost of fuel for electric generation and the cost of purchased power by adjusting rates as allowed through the fac 
ameren illinois recovers power supply costs from electric customers by adjusting rates through a rider mechanism to accommodate changes in power prices 
ameren missouri and ameren illinois are affected by changes in the cost of electric transmission services 
ferc regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission services 
each rto separately files regional transmission tariff rates for approval by ferc 
all members within that rto are then subjected to those rates 
because they are members of miso  ameren missouri s and ameren illinois transmission rates are calculated in accordance with miso s rate formula 
the transmission rate  updated in june of each year  is based on ferc filings for the previous year 
this rate is charged directly to wholesale customers 
ameren illinois also charges this rate directly to alternative retail electric suppliers 
for illinois retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier  the transmission rate is collected through a rider mechanism 
this rate is not directly charged to missouri retail customers because the mopsc includes transmission related costs in setting bundled retail rates in missouri 
in our missouri and illinois retail natural gas utility jurisdictions  changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through pga clauses 
ameren  ameren missouri and genco are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run cts 
these companies have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple natural gas pools and supply basins  and to minimize the impact to their financial statements 
ameren missouri s exposure to changes in market prices of natural gas is mitigated by its ability to recover increasing costs via a fac

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument  derivative or nonderivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
a derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on  or derived from  the value of some underlying asset or index 
the following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we handle market risks in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks  principally business  legal  and operational risks  are not part of the following discussion 
our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters 
our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee  which is composed of senior level ameren officers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with long term and short term variable rate debt  fixed rate debt  auction rate long term debt  and defined pension and postretirement benefit plans 
we manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of debt instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
for defined pension and postretirement benefit plans  we control the duration and the portfolio mix of our plan assets 
the following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by on variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest expense net income a ameren b ameren missouri ameren illinois c c genco a calculations are based on an estimated tax rate of   and for ameren  ameren missouri  ameren illinois and genco  respectively 
b includes intercompany eliminations 
c less than million 
the estimated changes above do not consider the potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist 
table of contents in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would probably act to mitigate further exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that might be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
exchange traded contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the respective exchanges and have nominal credit risk 
in all other transactions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction 
see note derivative financial instruments under part ii  item  of this report for information on the potential loss on counterparty exposure as of december  our rate regulated revenues are primarily derived from sales or delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers in missouri and illinois 
our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures 
the risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base 
at december   no nonaffiliated customer represented more than  in the aggregate  of our accounts receivable at ameren illinois 
noranda  ameren missouri s largest nonaffiliated electric customer  has appealed certain aspects of the and rate orders issued by the mopsc 
noranda has paid into court registries amounts that represent more than  in the aggregate  of ameren missouri s accounts receivable at december  in november  the missouri court of appeals issued a ruling that upheld the mopsc s january electric rate order 
therefore  ameren missouri expects to receive all of the funds held in the stoddard county circuit court s registry relating to the rate order  which totaled million as of december   during the first quarter of the funds related to the appeal will remain in the cole county circuit court s registry pending resolution  which is expected in see note rate and regulatory matters under part ii  item  of this report for additional information 
the risk associated with ameren illinois electric and natural gas trade receivables is also mitigated by a rate adjustment mechanism that allows ameren illinois to recover the difference between its actual bad debt expense under gaap and the bad debt expense included in its base rates 
ameren missouri and ameren illinois continue to monitor the impact of increasing rates on customer collections 
ameren missouri and ameren illinois make adjustments to their allowance for doubtful accounts as deemed necessary to ensure that such allowances are adequate to cover estimated uncollectible customer account balances 
ameren  ameren missouri  ameren illinois and genco may have credit exposure associated with off system or wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies 
at december   ameren s  ameren missouri s  ameren illinois and genco s combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated trading counterparties  excluding coal suppliers  deemed below investment grade either through external or internal credit evaluations  was million  net of collateral million 
almost all of the million exposure relates to ameren illinois long term purchase power and renewable energy credit contracts 
these contracts were procured through the ipa and are passed through directly to ameren illinois customers 
at december   the combined credit exposures to nonaffiliated coal suppliers  deemed below investment grade either through external or internal credit evaluations  net of collateral  were million  million and million at ameren  ameren missouri and genco  respectively 
million  million  million  respectively 
we establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program 
monitoring involves daily exposure reporting to senior management  master trading and netting agreements  and credit support  such as letters of credit and parental guarantees 
we also analyze each counterparty s financial condition before we enter into sales  forwards  swaps  futures  or option contracts 
we estimate our credit exposure to miso associated with the miso energy and operating reserves market to be million at december  million 
equity price risk our costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors  including the rate of return on plan assets 
ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in erisa 
ameren s goal is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to provide the benefits at the time they are payable while also to maximizing total return on plan assets and minimizing expense volatility consistent with its tolerance for risk 
ameren delegates investment management to specialists 
where appropriate  ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types 
ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines 
the expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio 
projected rates of return for each asset class were estimated after an analysis of historical experience  future expectations  and the volatility of the various asset classes 
after considering the target asset allocation for each asset class  we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns  and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets 

table of contents in future years  the costs of such plans will be reflected in net income  oci  or regulatory assets 
contributions to the plans could increase materially  if we do not achieve pension and postretirement asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of and  respectively 
ameren missouri also maintains a trust fund  as required by the nrc and missouri law  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities and debt securities 
it totaled million million 
by maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments  ameren missouri seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk 
however  the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
the debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ameren missouri actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options 
ameren missouri s exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated  because ameren missouri is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs  which would include unfavorable investment results  through electric rates 
additionally  ameren has company owned life insurance contracts that are used to support ameren s deferred compensation plans 
these life insurance contracts include equity and debt investments that are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in market prices for power  emission allowances  coal  transportation diesel  natural gas and uranium 
ameren s  ameren missouri s and genco s risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements 
merchant generation also seeks to sell power forward to wholesale  municipal  and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices 
we also attempt to mitigate financial risks through risk management programs and policies  which include forward hedging programs  and through the use of derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts  and financial swap contracts 
however  a portion of the generation capacity of ameren  ameren missouri and genco is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices 
the following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by on unhedged economic generation for through net income a ameren b ameren missouri c genco a calculations are based on an estimated tax rate of  and for ameren  ameren missouri and genco  respectively 
b includes amounts for ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations 
c less than million 
ameren s forward hedging power programs include the use of derivative financial swap contracts 
these swap contracts financially settle a fixed price against a floating price 
the floating price is typically the realized  or settled  price at a liquid regional hub at some forward period of time 
ameren controls the use of derivative financial swap contracts with volumetric and correlation limits that are intended to mitigate any material adverse financial impact 
historically  ameren has used swaps that settled against the cinergy hub miso locational marginal pricing 
this hub had traditionally been the most liquid location  with a strong correlation to the pricing that was realized at our generating locations 
as of december   miso stopped publishing cinergy hub pricing 
as a result  ameren will now use the indiana hub and other hubs as necessary for financial hedging 
ameren does not expect any material adverse financial impact to the outcomes of its forward hedging programs as a result of this change 
ameren will continue to pursue the best available options to fix pricing for the output of its generating units 
ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns 
due to our physical presence in the market  we are able to identify and pursue opportunities  which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities 
all of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process 
we establish value at risk var and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any material negative financial impact 
we manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation with techniques similar to those we use to manage risks associated with changing market prices for electricity 
merchant generation does not have the ability to pass higher fuel costs through to its customers for electric operations with the exception of an immaterial percentage of the output that has been contracted with a fuel cost pass through 
ameren missouri has a fac that allows ameren missouri to recover  through customer rates  of changes in fuel and purchased power costs  net of off system revenues  including miso costs and revenues  more or less than the amount set in base rates  without a traditional rate proceeding 
ameren missouri remains exposed to the remaining 

table of contents ameren  ameren missouri and genco have entered into coal contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal to manage their exposure to fuel prices 
the coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility 
additionally  the type of coal burned is part of ameren missouri s environmental compliance strategy 
ameren missouri has a multiyear agreement to purchase ultra low sulfur coal through to comply with the csapr and other environmental regulations 
the coal contract is with a single supplier 
disruptions of the deliveries of that ultra low sulfur coal from the supplier could compromise ameren missouri s ability to operate in compliance with emission standards 
other sources of ultra low sulfur coal are limited and the construction of pollution control equipment requires significant lead time to become operational 
should a temporary disruption of ultra low sulfur coal deliveries occur and its existing inventory of ultra low sulfur coal becomes fully depleted  and other sources of ultra low sulfur coal are not available  ameren missouri would use its existing emission allowances or purchase emission allowances in order to achieve compliance with environmental regulations 
genco purchases coal based on expected power sales  generally through bid procedures 
therefore  genco s forward coal requirements are dependent on the volume of power sales that have been contracted 
transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs 
ameren  ameren missouri and genco typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility 
natural gas transportation expenses for ameren s gas distribution utility companies and for the gas fired generation units of ameren  ameren missouri and genco are regulated by ferc through approved tariffs governing the rates  terms  and conditions of transportation and storage services 
certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by the ameren companies include rights to extend the term of contracts 
depending on our competitive position  we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements 
in addition  coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges 
we use forward fuel oil contracts both for heating and crude oil to mitigate this market price risk as changes in these products are highly correlated to changes in diesel markets 
if diesel fuel costs were to increase or decrease by a gallon  ameren s fuel expense could increase or decrease by million annually ameren missouri million  genco million 
as of december   ameren had a price cap for approximately of expected fuel surcharges in in the event of a significant change in coal prices  ameren  ameren missouri and genco would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources 
with regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel  ameren missouri has fixed priced  base price with escalation  and market priced agreements 
it uses inventories to provide some price hedge to fulfill its callaway energy center s needs for uranium  conversion  and enrichment 
there is no fuel reloading or planned maintenance outage scheduled for and ameren missouri has price hedges for approximately of its to nuclear fuel requirements 
nuclear fuel market prices remain subject to an unpredictable supply and demand environment 
ameren missouri has continued to follow a strategy of managing its inventory of nuclear fuel as an inherent price hedge 
new long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor 
new long term enrichment contracts usually have a base price with escalation price mechanism  and may also have either a market price related component or market based price re benchmarking 
ameren missouri expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the callaway energy center  at prices that cannot now be accurately predicted 
unlike the electricity and natural gas markets  nuclear fuel markets have somewhat limited financial instruments available for price hedging  so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts  if they are available 
the electric generating operations for ameren  ameren missouri and genco are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run cts 
the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs 
we optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins 
through the market allocation and auction process  ameren and ameren missouri have been granted ftrs associated with the miso energy and operating reserves market 
in addition  marketing company has acquired ftrs for its participation in the pjm northern illinois and miso market 
the ftrs are intended to mitigate electric transmission congestion charges related to the physical constraints of the transmission system 
depending on the congestion  ftrs could result in either charges or credits 
complex grid modeling tools are used to determine which ftrs to nominate in the ftr allocation process 
there is a risk of incorrectly modeling the amount of ftrs needed  and there is the potential that the ftrs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges 
with regard to ameren missouri s and ameren illinois electric and natural gas distribution businesses  exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place 
these cost recovery mechanisms allow ameren missouri and ameren illinois to pass on to retail customers prudently 
table of contents incurred costs for fuel  purchased power  and gas supply 
ameren missouri s and ameren illinois strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for their regulated customers 
the effects of price volatility cannot be eliminated 
however  procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier  as well as the management of physical assets 
the following table presents  as of december   the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired energy centers  nuclear fuel for ameren missouri s callaway energy center  natural gas for our cts and retail distribution  as appropriate  and purchased power needs of ameren illinois  which does not own generation  that are price hedged over the period through the projected required supply of these commodities could be significantly affected by changes in our assumptions for such matters as customer demand for our electric generation and our electric and natural gas distribution services  generation output  and inventory levels  among other matters
