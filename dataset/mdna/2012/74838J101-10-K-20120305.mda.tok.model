item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included in this annual report 
we base the scope of our operations and related expenses on our estimates of future revenues 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed  and we may not be able to rapidly adjust our expenses if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
our revenue estimates for future periods are based  among other factors  on estimated end user demand for our products 
furthermore  if end user consumption is less than estimated  revenues to our distribution partners would be expected to fall short of expectations 
factors that are beyond our control and that could affect our operating results in the future include seasonal fluctuations in our sales of infectious disease tests  which are generally highest in fall and winter  thus resulting in generally lower operating results in the second and third calendar quarters and higher operating results in the first and fourth calendar quarters  timing of the onset  length and severity of the cold and flu seasons  government and media attention focused on influenza and the related potential impact on humans from novel influenza viruses  such as hn and avian flu  changes in the level of competition  such as would occur if one of our larger and better financed competitors introduced a new or lower priced product to compete with one of our products  changes in the reimbursement systems or reimbursement amounts that end users rely upon in choosing to use our products  changes in economic conditions in our domestic and international markets  such as economic downturns  decreased healthcare spending  reduced consumer demand  inflation and currency fluctuations  changes in sales levels because a significant portion of our costs are fixed costs  relatively higher sales would be expected to increase profitability  while relatively lower sales would not reduce costs by the same proportion  and could cause operating losses  lower than anticipated market penetration of our new or more recently introduced products  significant quantities of our product or that of our competitors in our distributors inventories or distribution channels  and changes in distributor buying patterns 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop  obtain and protect our proprietary technology rights  otherwise  we may lose market share or need to reduce prices as a result of competitors selling technologically superior products that compete with our products 
our ability to compete successfully in the diagnostic market depends on continued development and introduction of new proprietary technology and the improvement of existing technology 
if we cannot continue to develop  obtain and protect proprietary technology  our total revenue and gross profits could be adversely affected 
moreover  our current and future licenses may not be adequate for the operation of our business 
our competitive position is heavily dependent on obtaining and protecting our own proprietary technology or obtaining licenses from others 
our ability to obtain patents and licenses  and their benefits  is uncertain 
we have issued patents both in the us and internationally  with expiration dates ranging from the present through approximately additionally  we have patent applications pending in various foreign jurisdictions 
these pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  or if issued  may not have priority over others applications or may not offer meaningful protection against competitors with similar technology or may not otherwise provide commercial value 
moreover  any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  found unenforceable or circumvented in the future 
in addition to our patents in the us  we have patents issued in various other countries including  australia  canada  japan and various european countries  including france  germany  italy  spain and the united kingdom 
third parties can make  use and sell products covered by our patents in any country in which we do not have patent protection 
we also license the right to use our products to our customers under label licenses that are for research purposes only 
these licenses could be contested and  because we cannot monitor all potential unauthorized uses of our products around the world  we might not be aware of an unauthorized use or might not be able to enforce the license restrictions in a cost effective manner 
in the future  we expect that we will require or desire additional licenses from other parties in order to refine our products further and to allow us to develop  manufacture and market commercially viable or superior products 
also  we may not be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others and required to produce our products on commercially reasonable terms 
to protect or enforce our patent rights  it may be necessary for us to initiate patent litigation proceedings against third parties  such as infringement suits or interference proceedings 
these lawsuits would be expensive  take significant time and would divert management s attention from other business concerns 
in the event that we seek to enforce any of our patents against an infringing party  it is likely that the party defending the claim will seek to invalidate the patents we assert  which could put our patents at risk of being invalidated  held unenforceable  or interpreted narrowly  and our patent applications at risk of not being issued 
further  these lawsuits may provoke the defendants to assert claims against us 
if we pursue any such claim  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of such suits or proceedings or that the damages or other remedies awarded to us  if any  will be economically valuable 
in addition to our patents  we rely on confidentiality agreements and other similar arrangements with our employees and other persons who have access to our proprietary and confidential information  together with trade secrets and other common law rights  to protect our proprietary and confidential technology 
these agreements and laws may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information or in the event that our competitors independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
moreover  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as those in the us in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information  if we encounter difficulties or are otherwise unable to effectively protect our intellectual property rights domestically or in foreign jurisdictions  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in order to remain competitive and profitable  we must expend considerable resources to research new technologies and products and develop new markets  and there is no assurance our efforts to develop new technologies  products or markets will be successful or such technologies  products or markets will be commercially viable 
we devote a significant amount of financial resources to researching and developing new technologies  new products and new markets 
the development  manufacture and sale of diagnostic products require a significant investment of resources 
moreover  no assurances can be given that our efforts to develop new technologies or products will be successful or that such technologies and products will be commercially viable 
the development of new markets also requires a substantial investment of resources  such as new employees  offices and manufacturing facilities 
accordingly  we are likely to incur increased operating expenses as a result of our increased investment in sales and marketing activities  manufacturing scale up and new product development associated with our efforts to accomplish our growth strategies discussed in item of this annual report 
as a result of any number of risk factors identified in this annual report  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our operational  growth and other strategic efforts 
in addition  the funds for our strategic development projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations and a working capital line of credit 
if our business slows and we become less profitable  and as a result have less money available to fund research and development  we will have to decide at that time which programs to reduce or eliminate  and by how much 
similarly  if adequate financial  personnel  equipment or other resources are not available  we may be required to delay or scale back our strategic efforts 
our operations will be adversely affected if our total revenue and gross profits do not correspondingly increase or if our technology  product and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed 
furthermore  our failure to successfully introduce new technologies or products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we rely on a limited number of key distributors which account for a substantial majority of our total revenue 
the loss of any key distributor or an unsuccessful effort by us to directly distribute our products could lead to reduced sales 
although we have many distributor relationships in the us  the market is dominated by a small number of these distributors 
four of our distributors  which are considered to be among the market leaders  collectively accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we had sales to two distributors for whom sales exceeded of total revenue for the year ended december  in addition  we rely on a few key distributors for a majority of our international sales  and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
the loss or termination of our relationship with any of these key distributors could significantly disrupt our business unless suitable alternatives were timely found or lost sales to one distributor are absorbed by another distributor 
finding a suitable alternative to a lost or terminated distributor may pose challenges in our industry s competitive environment  and another suitable distributor may not be found on satisfactory terms  if at all 
for instance  some distributors already have exclusive arrangements with our competitors  and others do not have the same level of penetration into our target markets as our existing distributors 
if total revenue to these or any of our other significant distributors were to decrease in any material amount in the future or we are not successful in timely transitioning business to new distributors  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our operating results are heavily dependent on sales of our influenza diagnostic tests 
although we continue to diversify our products  a significant percentage of our total revenues still continue to come from a limited number of our product families 
in particular  revenues from the sale of our influenza tests represent a significant portion of our total revenues and are expected to remain so in at least the near future 
in addition  the gross margins derived from sales of our influenza tests are significantly higher than the gross margins from our other core products 
as a result  if sales or revenues of our influenza tests decline for any reason whether as a result of market share loss or price pressure  obsolescence  a mild flu season  regulatory matters or any other reason our operating results would be materially and adversely affected on a disproportionate basis 
for the years ended december   and  sales of our infectious disease products including influenza test sales accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue 
if we are not able to manage our growth strategy or if we experience difficulties integrating companies or technologies we may acquire after their acquisition  our earnings may be adversely affected 
our business strategy contemplates further growth  which is likely to result in expanding the scope of operating and financial systems and the geographical area of our operations  including further expansion outside the us  as new products and technologies are developed and commercialized or new geographical markets are entered 
we may experience difficulties integrating the operations of other companies or technologies that we may acquire with our own operations  and as a result we may not realize our anticipated benefits and cost savings within our expected time frame  or at all 
because we have a relatively small executive staff  future growth may also divert management s attention from other aspects of our business  and will place a strain on existing management and our operational  financial and management information systems 
furthermore  we may expand into markets in which we have less experience or incur higher costs 
we expect to need to execute a number of tasks in a timely  efficient and successful manner in order to realize the benefits and cost savings of acquisitions  including retaining and assimilating key personnel  managing the regulatory and reimbursement approval processes  intellectual property protection strategies and commercialization activities  creating uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information systems  including with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  and meeting the challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees potentially in different geographic locations  including the need to implement appropriate systems  policies  benefits and compliance programs 
acquisitions may subject us to other risks  including unanticipated costs and expenditures  potential changes in relationships with strategic partners  potential contractual or intellectual property issues  fluctuations in quarterly results and financial condition as a result of timing of acquisitions and potential accounting charges and write downs  and potential unknown liabilities associated with the strategic combination and the combined operations 
should we encounter difficulties in managing these tasks and risks  our growth strategy may suffer and our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected 
intellectual property risks and third party claims of infringement  misappropriation of proprietary rights or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or attempt to seek licenses from third parties  and materially adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management and other key employees 
companies in or related to our industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
there are often intellectual property risks associated with developing and producing new products and entering new markets  and we may not be able to obtain  at reasonable cost or upon commercially reasonable terms  if at all  licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to be part of such new or existing products 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
we have hired and will continue to hire individuals or contractors who have experience in medical diagnostics and these individuals or contractors may have confidential trade secret or proprietary information of third parties 
we cannot assure you that these individuals or contractors will not use this third party information in connection with performing services for us or otherwise reveal this third party information to us 
thus  we could be sued for misappropriation of proprietary information and trade secrets 
such claims are expensive to defend and could divert our attention and result in substantial damage awards and injunctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that individuals or contractors apply technical or scientific information independently developed by them to our projects  disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data and may result in litigation 
moreover  in the past we have been engaged in litigation with parties that claim  among other matters  that we infringed their patents 
the defense and prosecution of patent and trade secret claims are both costly and time consuming 
we or our customers may be sued by other parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated their proprietary rights or that may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
an adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products  limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved with such products may perform for us  increase our costs of revenue and expose us to significant liability 
as a general matter  our involvement in litigation or in any claims to determine proprietary rights  as may arise from time to time  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations for reasons such as pending litigation may of itself cause our distributors or end users to reduce or terminate purchases of our products  it may consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources  its outcome would be uncertain and a court may find any third party patent claims valid and infringed by our products issuing a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall such products from the market  redesign such products offered for sale or under development or restrict employees from performing work in their areas of expertise  governmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees  former employees and us relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party s proprietary rights  an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability in the form of past royalty payments  penalties  special and punitive damages  the opposing party s attorney fees  and future royalty payments significantly affecting our future earnings  and failure to obtain a necessary license upon commercially reasonable terms  if at all upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or other products we may develop 
even if licenses to intellectual property rights are available  they can be costly 
we have entered into various licensing agreements  which largely require payments based on specified product sales as well as the achievement of specific milestones 
royalty expenses under these licensing agreements collectively totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
expenses relating to licensing arrangements totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe we will continue to incur substantial royalty expenses relating to future sales of our products and the achievement of specific milestones 
in addition to the foregoing  we may also be required to indemnify some customers  distributors and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another person s proprietary rights 
further  our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors  suppliers or customers 
we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
our contractors  suppliers and licensors may not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us  or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount  above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages 
our senior credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities  limits the amount we can borrow  and requires us to comply with various financial covenants 
we currently have a million senior secured syndicated credit facility senior credit facility  which matures on october  the senior credit facility bears interest at the lower of either the eurodollar rate or base rate 
the eurodollar rate is equal to the eurodollar rate plus the applicable rate  and the base rate is equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent plus the applicable rate  or the lenders prime rate 
the applicable rate is generally determined in accordance with a performance pricing grid based on our leverage ratio and ranges from to for eurodollar rate loans and from to for base rate loans 
the agreement governing the senior credit facility is subject to certain customary limitations  including among others limitation on liens  limitation on mergers  consolidations and sales of assets  limitation on debt  limitation on dividends  stock redemptions and the redemption and or prepayment of other debt  limitation on investments including loans and advances and acquisitions  limitation on transactions with affiliates  and limitation on annual capital expenditures 
the terms of the senior credit facility require us to comply with certain financial covenants that include a funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio as defined in the senior credit facility  with adjusted ebitda generally calculated as earnings before  among other adjustments  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization not to exceed to as of the end of each fiscal quarter  and an interest coverage ratio of not less than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
if we fail to comply with these restrictions or covenants  our senior credit facility could become due and payable prior to maturity 
as of december  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
we may incur significant additional indebtedness 
our indebtedness could be costly or have adverse consequences 
we may incur significant additional indebtedness  subject to the restrictions in our senior credit facility 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our million senior credit facility 
our borrowing capacity can fluctuate from time to time due to  among other factors  our funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio as and when measured under the senior credit facility 
our indebtedness could be costly or have adverse consequences  such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt  limiting our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt obligations and other general corporate requirements  making us more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the general economy or our industry and to fluctuations in our operating results  including affecting our ability to comply with and maintain any financial tests and ratios required under our indebtedness  limiting our flexibility to engage in certain transactions or to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and the diagnostics industry  putting us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less relative and or less restrictive debt  and subjecting us to additional restrictive financial and other covenants 
we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital or operating needs  which could have adverse consequences on our operations and the interests of our stockholders 
seasonal fluctuations in our operating results could limit the cash we have available for research and development and other operating needs or cause us to fail to comply with the financial covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness 
as a result  we may need to seek to raise funds through public or private debt or sale of equity to achieve our business strategy or to avoid non compliance with our financial covenants 
in addition  we may need funds to complete acquisitions  or may issue equity in connection with acquisitions 
if we raise funds or acquire other technologies or businesses through issuance of equity  this could dilute the interests of our stockholders 
moreover  the availability of additional capital  whether debt or equity from private capital sources including banks or the public capital markets  fluctuates as our financial condition and industry or market conditions in general change 
there may be times when the private capital markets and the public debt or equity markets lack sufficient liquidity or when our securities cannot be sold at attractive prices  in which case we would not be able to access capital from these sources on favorable terms  if at all 
we can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital 
volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  as well as our ability to access credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers 
the global capital and credit markets recently experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval  characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the us federal government 
these conditions could adversely affect the demand for our products and services and  therefore  reduce purchases by our customers  which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations  financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may limit our access to capital  and may also negatively affect our customers and our suppliers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses 
as a result  our customers needs and ability to purchase our products or services may decrease  and our suppliers may increase their prices  reduce their output or change their terms of sale 
if our customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  our customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to us  and our suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms or reduce or terminate production of products they supply to us 
any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services  or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms  may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
additionally  both state and federal government sponsored and private payers  as a result of budget deficits or reductions  may seek to reduce their health care expenditures by renegotiating their contracts with us 
any reduction in payments by such government sponsored or private payers may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
declining economic conditions may also increase our costs 
if economic conditions remain volatile  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may not achieve market acceptance of our products among physicians and other healthcare providers  and this would have a negative effect on future sales 
a large part of our business is based on the sale of rapid poc diagnostic tests that physicians and other healthcare providers can administer in their own facilities without sending samples to central laboratories 
clinical reference laboratories and hospital based laboratories are significant competitors of ours in connection with these rapid poc diagnostic tests and provide a majority of the diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers 
our future sales depend on  among other matters  capture of sales from these laboratories by achieving market acceptance of poc testing from physicians and other healthcare providers 
if we do not capture sales at the levels in our budget  our total revenue will not grow as much as we expect and the costs we incur or have incurred will be disproportionate to our sales levels 
we expect that clinical reference and hospital based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our poc diagnostic products in order to maintain and expand their existing dominance of the overall diagnostic testing market 
moreover  even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective  save time  or have better performance  physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing to poc tests 
our failure to achieve market acceptance from physicians and healthcare providers with respect to the use of our poc diagnostic products would have a negative effect on our future sales growth 
the industry and market segment in which we operate are highly competitive  and intense competition with other providers of poc diagnostic products may reduce our sales and margins 
in addition to competition from laboratories  our poc diagnostic tests compete with similar products made by our competitors 
there are a large number of multinational and regional competitors making investments in competing technologies and products  including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies 
in addition  there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets over the last few years 
we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 
we expect this trend toward industry consolidation may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
we also face competition from our distributors as some have created  and others may decide to create  their own products to compete with ours 
a number of our competitors have a potential competitive advantage because they have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources  and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we have 
moreover  some competitors offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we have 
if our competitors products are more effective than ours or take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing  our total revenue and profits could be materially and adversely affected 
our products are highly regulated by various governmental agencies 
any changes to the existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our ability to manufacture and market our products 
the testing  manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
the fda regulates most of our products  which are currently all class i or ii devices 
the us department of agriculture regulates our veterinary products 
our future performance depends on  among other matters  when and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval for new products 
in addition  certain of our foreign product registrations are owned or controlled by our international distribution partners  such that any change in our arrangement with such partners could result in the loss of or delay in transfer of any such product registrations  thereby interrupting our ability to sell our products in those markets 
regulatory review can be a lengthy  expensive and uncertain process  making the timing and costs of clearances and approvals difficult to predict 
our total revenue would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of approvals or clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances or the placement of limits on the marketing and use of our products 
furthermore  in the ordinary course of business  we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
if regulators subsequently disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with these regulations  we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties  as well as field corrective actions  product recall  seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products 
the assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and affect our operating results  and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes in government policy could adversely affect our business and profitability 
changes in government policy could have a significant impact on our business by increasing the cost of doing business  affecting our ability to sell our products and negatively impacting our profitability 
such changes could include modifications to existing legislation  such as us tax policy  or entirely new legislation  such as the recently adopted healthcare reform bill signed into law in the us although we cannot fully predict the many ways that health care reform might affect our business  the law imposes a excise tax on certain transactions  including many us sales of medical devices  which we expect will include us sales of our test kits and instruments 
this tax is scheduled to take effect january  it is unclear whether and to what extent  if at all  other anticipated developments resulting from health care reform  such as an increase in the number of people with health insurance  may provide us additional revenue to offset this increased tax 
if additional revenue does not materialize  or if our efforts to offset the excise tax through spending cuts or other actions are unsuccessful  the increased tax burden would adversely affect our financial performance 
we are subject to numerous government regulations in addition to fda regulation  and compliance with laws  including changed or new laws  could increase our costs and adversely affect our operations 
in addition to fda and other regulations referred to above  numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances impact our business operations 
if these laws or their interpretation change or new laws regulating any of our businesses are adopted  the costs of compliance with these laws could substantially increase our overall costs 
failure to comply with any laws  including laws regulating the manufacture and marketing of our products  could result in substantial costs and loss of sales or customers 
because of the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry  and the number of governmental agencies whose actions could affect our operations  it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of future legislation or regulatory developments relating to our industry and our products 
to the extent the costs and procedures associated with meeting new or changing requirements are substantial  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we use hazardous materials in our business that may result in unexpected and substantial claims against us relating to handling  storage or disposal 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
these regulations include federal statutes commonly known as cercla  rcra and the clean water act 
compliance with these laws and regulations is already expensive 
if any governmental authorities were to impose new environmental regulations requiring compliance in addition to that required by existing regulations  or alter their interpretation of the requirements of such regulations  such environmental regulations could impair our research  development or production efforts by imposing additional  and possibly substantial  costs  restrictions or compliance procedures on our business 
in addition  because of the nature of the penalties provided for in some of these environmental regulations  we could be required to pay sizeable fines  penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance with environmental laws 
any environmental violation or remediation requirement could also partially or completely shut down our research and manufacturing facilities and operations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated and exposure of individuals to these materials could result in substantial fines  penalties or damages that are not covered by insurance 
our total revenue could be affected by third party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints 
the end users of our products are primarily physicians and other healthcare providers 
in the us  healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third party payers  principally private health insurance plans  federal medicare and state medicaid  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure 
use of our products would be adversely impacted if physicians and other health care providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products by their patients third party payers 
our total revenue could also be adversely affected by changes or trends in reimbursement policies of these governmental or private healthcare payers 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to  and will continue to lead to  increased pressures on the healthcare industry  both foreign and domestic  to reduce the cost of products and services 
given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the us in recent years  currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development 
third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the us or foreign markets  current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payers may reduce the demand for our products or adversely impact our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
unexpected increases in  or inability to meet  demand for our products could require us to spend considerable resources to meet the demand or harm our reputation and customer relationships if we are unable to meet demand 
our inability to meet customer demand for our products  whether as a result of manufacturing problems or supply shortfalls  could harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry 
this  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we experience unexpected increases in the demand for our products  we may be required to expend additional capital resources to meet these demands 
these capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or even the cost of new manufacturing facilities 
this would increase our capital costs  which could adversely affect our earnings and cash resources 
if we are unable to develop or obtain necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner  our total revenue could be adversely affected 
failure to cost effectively increase production volumes  if required  or lower than anticipated yields or production problems  including those encountered as a result of changes that we may make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand or changes in applicable laws and regulations  could result in shipment delays as well as increased manufacturing costs  which could also have a material adverse effect on our total revenue and profitability 
unexpected increases in demand for our products could also require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the demand 
some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and we may not be able to timely access sufficient raw materials in the event of an unexpected increase in demand  particularly those obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
interruptions in the supply of raw materials and components could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
some of our raw materials and components are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
we have long term supply agreements with many of these suppliers  but these long term agreements involve risks for us  such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials and components and our reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery 
it is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials or components to us 
any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components  and our inability to quickly and cost effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply  could have a material adverse effect on our total revenue or cost of sales and related profits 
in addition  we use third party packaging companies to ship our products to customers 
an interruption in the businesses of these third party packaging companies could result in a delay of shipments to customers 
if one or more of our products is claimed to be defective  we could be subject to claims of liability and harm to our reputation that could adversely affect our business 
a claim of a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injuries and otherwise 
any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim would have a material adverse effect on our profitability and the damage to our reputation or product lines in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are exposed to business risk which  if not covered by insurance  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face a number of business risks  including exposure to product liability claims 
although we maintain insurance for a number of these risks  we may face claims for types of damages  or for amounts of damages  that are not covered by our insurance 
for example  although we currently carry product liability insurance for liability losses  there is a risk that product liability or other claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy 
also  our existing insurance may not be renewed at the same cost and level of coverage as currently in effect  or may not be renewed at all 
further  we do not currently have insurance against many environmental risks we confront in our business 
if we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage  whether arising out of product liability matters or from some other matter  that claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business could be negatively affected by the loss of or the inability to hire key personnel 
our future success depends in part on our ability to retain our key technical  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify and hire additional qualified personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  both in the industry in which we operate and where our operations are located 
further  we expect to grow our operations  and our needs for additional management and other key personnel are expected to increase 
if we are not able to retain existing key personnel  or timely identify and hire replacement or additional qualified personnel to meet expected growth  our business could be adversely impacted 
we face risks relating to our international sales  including inherent economic  political and regulatory risks  which could impact our financial performance  cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our growth 
our products are sold internationally  with the majority of our international sales to our customers in japan and europe 
we currently sell and market our products through distributor organizations and sales agents 
sales to foreign customers accounted for   and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international sales are subject to inherent economic  political and regulatory risks  which could impact our financial performance  cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our international growth 
these foreign risks include  among others compliance with multiple different registration requirements and new and changing registration requirements  our inability to benefit from registration for our products inasmuch as registrations may be controlled by a distributor  and the difficulty in transitioning our product registrations  compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations  including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials  could expose us or our employees to fines and criminal sanctions and damage our reputation  tariffs or other barriers as we continue to expand into new countries and geographic regions  exposure to currency exchange fluctuations against the us dollar  longer payment cycles  generally lower average selling prices and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  reduced  or lack of  protection for  and enforcement of  intellectual property rights  political and economic instability in some of the regions where we currently sell our products or that we may expand into in the future  potentially adverse tax consequences  and diversion to the us of our products sold into international markets at lower prices 
currently  the majority of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in us dollars 
nonetheless  these sales are subject to currency risks  since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
these exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products  as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
in order to maintain a competitive price for our products internationally  we may have to continue to provide discounts or otherwise effectively reduce our prices  resulting in a lower margin on products sold internationally 
continued change in the values of the euro  the japanese yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we have a supply agreement with a foreign vendor whereby we evenly share the foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 
we may  in the future  enter into similar arrangements 
investor confidence and our share price may be adversely impacted if we or our independent registered public accounting firm conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring us  as a public company  to include a report of management on our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
how companies are implementing these requirements  including internal control reforms  if any  to comply with section s requirements  and how independent registered public accounting firms are applying these requirements and testing companies internal controls  remain subject to uncertainty 
the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of are ongoing 
we expect that our internal controls will continue to evolve as our business activities change 
although we seek to diligently and vigorously review our internal controls over financial reporting in an effort to ensure compliance with the section requirements  any control system  regardless of how well designed  operated and evaluated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that its objectives will be met 
in addition  the integration of the business and operations of any future acquisitions could heighten the risk of deficiencies in our internal controls  particularly in the case of acquisitions of private companies  which may not have internal controls over financial reporting adequate for public company reporting 
if  during any year  our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated  tested or assessed  or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements  rules or regulations differently than we do  then it may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and effectiveness of our internal controls  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
risks related to our common shares our stock price has been highly volatile  and an investment in our stock could suffer a significant decline in value 
the market price of our common shares has been highly volatile and has fluctuated substantially in the past 
for example  between december  and december   the closing price of our common shares  as reported by the nasdaq global market  has ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect our common shares to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the risk factors discussed herein 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for healthcare companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that  at times  have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the relevant companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common shares 
sales of our common shares in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could negatively impact the market price of our common shares 
as of december  approximately million of our common shares were issued of which approximately million are generally tradable in the public markets without restrictions  approximately million of our common shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options under our various equity incentive plans at a weighted average exercise price of  and we had approximately million of our common shares underlying restricted stock 
we also have a number of institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our common shares 
if one or more of these stockholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time  for liquidity or other reasons  the prevailing market price of our common shares could be negatively affected 
in addition  the issuance of additional common shares as occurred in january  or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares or other equity linked securities  including preferred stock or warrants  will dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders and could depress the market price of our common shares and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
we may need to seek additional capital 
if this additional financing is obtained through the issuance of equity securities  debt convertible into equity or options or warrants to acquire equity securities  our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution upon the issuance  conversion or exercise of such securities 
our governing documents and rights plan may delay stockholder actions with respect to business combinations or the election of directors  or delay or prevent a sale of the company or changes in management 
our governing documents and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying stockholder actions with respect to business combinations or the election of directors  or delaying or preventing a sale of the company or a change in our management  including the following our amended and restated bylaws require stockholders to give written notice of any proposal or director nomination to us within a specified period of time prior to any stockholder meeting and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders  unless such stockholders hold at least of our stock entitled to vote at the meeting 
our board of directors may approve the issuance  without further action by the stockholders  of our preferred shares  and fix the rights and preferences thereof 
an issuance of preferred shares with dividend and liquidation rights senior to our common shares or convertible into a large number of our common shares could prevent a potential acquirer from gaining effective economic or voting control

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues primarily from product sales 
these revenues are recorded net of rebates and other discounts which are estimated at the time of sale 
the rebates and other discounts are largely driven by various customer program offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
change in title to the product and recognition of revenue occur upon delivery to the customer when sales terms are free on board fob destination and at the time of shipment when the sales terms are fob shipping point and there is no right of return 
we earn income from the licensing of technology 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
we also earn income from grants for research and commercialization activities which are recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable 
income earned from licensing and grant activities are a component of total revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation compensation expense related to stock options granted is recognized ratably over the service vesting period for the entire option award 
the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by estimated forfeiture rates 
we determine the estimated fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
compensation expense for time based restricted stock awards and units is measured at the grant date and recognized ratably over the vesting period 
we determine the fair value of time based and performance based restricted stock based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
a majority of the restricted stock granted in was performance based and vesting is tied to achievement of specific company goals in for purposes of measuring compensation expense  we estimate the amount of shares ultimately expected to vest at each reporting date based on management s expectations regarding achievement of the relevant performance criteria 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based restricted stock requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
this may result in significant expense recognition in the period in which the performance goals are met or when achievement of the goals is deemed probable or may result in the reversal of previously recognized stock based compensation expense if the performance criteria are deemed not probable of being met 
the grant date of the performance based restricted stock takes place when the grant is authorized and the specific achievement goals are communicated 
the communication date of the performance goals can impact the valuation and associated expense of the restricted stock 
the computation of the expected option life is based on a weighted average calculation combining the average life of options that have already been exercised and post vest cancellations with the estimated life of the remaining vested and unexercised options 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on the u 
s treasury yield curve over the expected term of the option 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
the estimated forfeiture rate is based on our historical experience and future expectations 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and adversely impact our reported results 
inventory our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our actual demand is less than our forecast demand  we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and adversely impact net operating results in the future 
intangible assets the effective life and related amortization of intangible assets with definite lives will be based on the higher of the percentage of usage or the straight line method 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
goodwill and in process research and development that have indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we are required to perform periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill and in process research and development as of december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
we recorded a million impairment charge of in process research and development related to a discontinued research and development project for the year ended december  determining the fair values and useful lives of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the alere amendment described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report requires the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets  we used the discounted cash flow method in determining the value of licensed technology associated with the alere amendment 
this method required significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates were required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we used to value and amortize intangible assets were consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and were based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
software development costs software development costs associated with software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  software development costs are capitalized 
the capitalized cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated product life or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  current tax assets and liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning opportunities 
to the extent that a determination is made to establish or adjust a valuation allowance  the expense or benefit is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained during an audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcome of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information on income taxes 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from excess tax benefits 
as of december  and  deferred tax assets do not include million and million  respectively of these excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of our net operating loss carryforwards 
additional paid in capital would be increased up to million if such excess tax benefits are realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the fair market value of our floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
we had million outstanding under our senior credit facility at december  the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings is currently 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december  and  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure from such instruments to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates 
our current investment policy with respect to our cash and cash equivalents focuses on maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity 
although we continually evaluate our placement of investments  as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were placed in money market or overnight funds that we believe are highly liquid and not subject to material market fluctuation risk 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in us dollars 
nonetheless  these sales are subject to currency risks  since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
these exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products  as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
continued change in the values of the euro  the japanese yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations  which means that we are fully exposed to exchange rate changes 
in addition  we have a supply agreement with a foreign vendor whereby we evenly share the foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk 
we may  in the future  enter into similar such arrangements
