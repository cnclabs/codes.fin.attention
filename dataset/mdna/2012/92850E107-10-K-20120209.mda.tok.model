with the acquisition of milan  vitran added service centers including expanded and new state coverage in alabama  georgia  mississippi  north carolina and south carolina 
within the united states  the company operates primarily within the eastern  southeastern  central  southwestern and western united states and delivers approximately of its freight shipments within one or two days 
in addition  the company offers its services to the other regions in the united states other than alaska and hawaii through its strategic inter regional relationships 
the service is provided over the road  mostly by company drivers  which allows more control in servicing these time sensitive shipments 
vitran s us ltl business represented approximately of total ltl revenues for the year ended december  within canada  the company provides next day service within ontario  quebec and parts of western canada  and generates most of its revenue from the movement of ltl freight within the three to five day east west service lanes 
the majority of its trans canada freight is shipped intermodally  whereby the company s containers are loaded onto rail cars and trans loaded to vitran facilities where vitran s network of owner operators pick up and deliver the freight to various destinations 
an expedited service solution is also offered nationally using over the road driver teams to complete these deliveries in a shorter time frame 
vitran s canadian ltl business represented approximately of total ltl revenues for the year ended december  vitran s transborder service solution inter regional provides over the road service between its canadian ltl and us ltl business units 
this is the company s highest margin and fastest growing service  achieving a five year compounded average growth rate of approximately per annum at december  supply chain operation vitran s sco segment represented approximately of its revenues for the year ended december  the sco involves the management and transportation of goods and the provision of information about such goods as they pass through the supply chain from manufacturer to end user 
the sco s role is to design a supply chain network for a customer  contract with the necessary suppliers including vitran s ltl services  as well as implement the design and management of the logistical system 
vitran s sco offers a range of services in canada and the united states including cross docks  inventory management  flow through distribution facilities  and dedicated distribution facilities that focus primarily on long term customized supply chain solutions 
in addition  sco provides over the road or intermodal freight brokerage services with sales offices in toronto  montreal and los angeles  so as to capitalize on international traffic flows in north america 
over the past decade  vitran has grown its sco segment organically  and on november   announced the strategic acquisition of las vegas la express inc lvla  a retail supply chain management specialist based in ontario  california 
lvla operated six facilities  and its acquisition by vitran added  square feet of logistics space 
as at december   vitran s sco had approximately million square feet of warehouse and distribution space under management 
truckload on november   the company sold the majority of the rolling stock of the former truckload segment for proceeds of million and retained the net working capital of million 
the company recorded a gain of million on the equipment sold and wrote off the remaining million of goodwill attributable to this business in fiscal the operating results and divestiture of the segment have been recorded as a discontinued operation 

table of contents the trucking industry the trucking industry consists of two segments  specifically private fleets and for hire carriers 
the private carrier segment consists of fleets owned and operated by shippers who move their own goods 
the for hire segment is further divided into truckload tl and ltl sub segments  based on the typical shipment size handled by the carrier 
tl refers to carriers transporting shipments greater than  pounds and ltl refers to carriers generally transporting shipments of less than  pounds 
vitran is predominantly an ltl carrier with a focus on regional and inter regional ltl lanes 
ltl carriers transport freight for multiple customers to multiple destinations on each trailer 
this service requires a network of local pick up and delivery terminals  hub facilities  and driver fleets 
the ltl business is capital intensive  and achieving significant density of operations in a given region can afford a competitive advantage since greater freight volumes are better able to support fixed costs 
vitran believes the regional ltl industry offers a favorable operating model and provides substantial growth opportunities for the following reasons the trend among shippers toward minimal inventories  deferred air freight  and regional distribution has increased the demand for next day and second day delivery service  regional carriers with sufficient scale and freight density to support local terminal networks can offer greater service reliability and minimize the costs associated with intermediate handling  regional carriers are predominantly non union  which offers cost savings  greater flexibility  and a lower likelihood of service disruptions  compared with unionized carriers  and there has been a reduction of capacity as weaker competitors exit the business 
marketing and customers vitran derives its revenue from thousands of customers from a variety of geographic regions and industries in canada and the united states 
the company has no customer that represents more than of vitran s revenues 
at december   the company employed sales associates 
sales associates maintain a dialogue with new and existing customers within the geographic market 
new customers are obtained through referrals  cold calls and trade publications 
the sales associates receive a base salary and  depending on the business unit  a variable compensation package that can be linked to revenue generation  business unit profitability and days sales outstanding 
the ltl segment analyzes the price level that is appropriate for each particular shipment of freight 
when necessary  vitran competes to secure revenue by participating in bid solicitations  provided its customer recognizes the company as a core carrier over a contracted period of time 
in sco  vitran customizes each solution to fit the needs of the customer 
the sco pursues opportunities that will not only increase the profitability of that segment but will supplement activity in vitran s ltl segment as well 
employees at december  vitran employed approximately  full and part time employees and contracted with approximately owner operators 
the vast majority of our employees are not represented by unionized collective bargaining agreements 
the advantage of employing predominantly non union labour is more work rules flexibility with respect to work schedules  routes and other similar items 
work rule flexibility is important in our business segments to meet the service level requirements of our customers 
a total of vitran employees are represented by two labor unions  representing of the company s labour force 
the international brotherhood of teamsters and the canadian auto workers association represent dock workers in two of vitran s canadian terminals 
the company has never had a work stoppage 
the collective bargaining agreements between the company and its unionized employees expire on february  and on march   respectively 

table of contents information technology vitran uses technology to reduce costs  improve productivity  and enhance its customer service 
vitran allows its customers to access or exchange information with the company via vitran s website  published web services  electronic data interchange  or over the telephone 
the company uses sophisticated freight handling software to maximize its load average  reduce freight handling  reduce transit times  and improve tracking of shipments through its system 
in the second quarter of  vitran s us ltl business unit completed the process of migrating all of its us ltl operations to a common transportation operating system that further enhanced the company s technology platform and helped deliver superior service to its customers 
vitran continues to develop its transportation operating systems to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of service to its customers and improve productivity throughout the organization 
vitran s sco segment customizes the technology platform to its client requirements spanning the simplest of connections to highly integrated solutions 
seasonality in the trucking industry for a typical year  the months of september and october usually have the highest business levels  while the months of december  january and february generally have the lowest business levels 
adverse weather conditions generally experienced in the first quarter of the year  such as heavy snow and ice storms  have a negative impact on operating results 
accordingly  revenue and profitability are normally lowest in the first quarter 
regulation regulatory agencies exercise broad powers over the trucking industry  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety and financial reporting 
the industry also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  ergonomics  or limits on vehicle weight and size 
additional changes in the laws and regulations governing the trucking industry could affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to customers 
in addition to the us department of transportation dot  vitran is subject to regulations from  but not limited to  the department for homeland security  environmental protection agency  and the food and drug administration 
from time to time  various legislative proposals that might affect the trucking industry are introduced  including proposals to increase federal  state  provincial or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels 
vitran cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to the company will be enacted 
increased taxes could adversely affect vitran s profitability 
vitran s employees and owner operators also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot  specifically  comprehensive safety analysis csa mandated by the federal motor carrier safety administration fmsca and various regulatory authorities in canada  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
competition vitran competes with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes within canada and the united states 
in the united states  vitran competes mainly in the eastern  southeastern  central  southwestern and western states 
the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
the company competes with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers  truckload carriers  third party logistics companies and  to a lesser extent  small package carriers  air freight carriers and railroads 
the company competes effectively in its markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices

table of contents item a risk factors risks and uncertainties an investment in our company involves a high degree of risk 
before making an investment in the common shares of the company  you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company or otherwise associated with an investment in our company 
if we do not successfully address any of the risks described herein or therein  there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results and business  and the trading price of our common shares may decline 
we can provide no assurance that we will successfully address these risks 
risks relating to our company our industry is highly competitive  and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect operations and profitability 
the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
we compete with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers  truckload carriers  third party logistics companies and  to a lesser extent  small package carriers  air freight carriers and railroads 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
these factors include the following we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes  many of which have more equipment  a broader coverage network  a wider range of services and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages  some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase our prices or maintain significant growth in our business  many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved transportation service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected  our customers may negotiate rates or contracts that minimize or eliminate our ability to offset fuel price increases through a fuel surcharge on our customers  many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors  the trend towards consolidation in the surface transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources than us and other competitive advantages relating to their size  advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments  and competition from non asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and prices 
we are subject to financial covenants under our revolving credit facility 
under our current revolving credit facility  we are subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that requires compliance only when certain triggering events occur 
this financial covenant  as well as other financial covenants that may in the future be imposed under our current or future credit facilities  could limit our ability to raise additional capital to fund future growth 
in addition  any adverse change to our business that has a material negative impact on our financial performance could cause us not to be able to be in compliance with these covenants 
our inability to remain in compliance with our financial covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities which would require us to attempt to re negotiate these financial covenants  attempt to obtain new financing or scale back our business operations to achieve compliance 
there is no assurance that we would be able to re negotiate our financial covenants in this event  which could reduce the amount of credit available under our credit facilities 

table of contents we are subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
our business is subject to a number of general economic factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  many of which are largely out of our control 
these include recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customer business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries  such as retail  manufacturing and chemical  where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions may adversely affect the business levels of our customers  the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services 
it is not possible to predict the long term effects of above mentioned factors on the economy or on customer confidence in canada or the united states  or the impact  if any  on our future results of operations 
adverse changes in economic conditions could result in declines to our revenues and a reduction in our current level of profitability 
if the world wide financial crisis worsens  it could adversely impact demand for our services 
the global capital markets have been experiencing significant disruption and volatility over the past few years as evidenced by a lack of liquidity in the debt markets  significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and failure of certain major financial institutions 
continued market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns which may lead to lower demand for our services  increased incidence of customers inability to pay their accounts  or insolvency of our customers  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity  cash flows and financial condition 
moreover  such market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access debt and equity capital markets 
market conditions may affect our ability to refinance indebtedness as and when it becomes due 
we are unable to predict the effect the uncertainty in the capital markets may have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
our supply chain operation business is dependent upon long term relationships with our customers 
we have entered into long term relationships with our customers whereby we have agreed to provide supply chain solutions to our customers which involve the establishment and operation of warehousing  inventory management and flow through distribution facilities 
the success of these relationships is dependent upon our continued ability to meet the requirements under our customers contracts  as well as the continued financial success and business operations of our customers 
if we are unable to continue to deliver our supply chain solutions to our customers  either as a result of a determination by our customers not to continue to use our services or our customer ceasing to operate its business for any reason  our revenues from our supply chain solutions business may decline and we may not be able to recover our investment in the distribution facilities that we have established to deliver these services to our customers 
increases in our operating expenses could cause our profitability to decline 
our significant cash operating expenses include salaries  wages and employee benefits  purchased transportation  maintenance expenses  rents and leases  purchased labor and owner operators  fuel and fuel related expenses 
increases in our operating expenses will adversely impact on our profitability to the extent that we are not able to pass these increased expenses on to our customers through increased rates for our transportation services 
many of these operating expenses are beyond our control and  in addition  are subject to competitive forces 
further  we operate in a price sensitive industry where customers have many alternatives for their transportation services and  as a result  we may have limited ability to pass on increased operating expenses to our customers 
unsuccessful execution of our acquisition strategy could cause our business and future growth prospects to suffer 
we may not be able to implement our strategy to acquire other transportation companies  which depends in part on the availability of suitable candidates 
in addition  we may face competition for the acquisition of attractive carriers from other consolidators in the freight transportation industry who may be larger or better financed than we are 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that if we acquire what we consider to be a suitable candidate in 
table of contents accordance with our growth strategy  we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company into our operations on an accretive basis 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company  we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisition and the performance of our operations after completion of such acquisition could be adversely affected 
significant ongoing capital requirements could limit growth and affect profitability 
our business is capital intensive 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our capital requirements  we may have to limit our growth  utilize our existing revolving credit facility  or enter into additional  financing arrangements 
while we intend to finance expansion and renovation projects with existing cash  cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our existing credit agreement  we may require additional financing to support our continued growth 
however  due to the existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets  capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow the necessary capital to fund our planned capital expenditures  we will be forced to limit our growth and or operate our equipment for longer periods of time  resulting in increased maintenance costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are or continue to be adversely affected by current economic conditions and disruption to the capital and credit markets  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
availability and cost of real estate could limit growth and affect profitability 
our businesses in the united states and canada are dependent on the cost and availability of terminal facilities and distribution centers within key markets 
shortages in the availability of existing facilities and distribution centers for sale or lease could increase our operating expenses and prevent us from effectively serving certain markets 
unavailability of land for purchase and construction delays due to various reasons such as delays in obtaining permits may also adversely impact cash flows 
the engines in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions control regulations which could substantially increase operating expenses 
tractor engines that comply with the environmental protection agency epa emission control design requirements that took effect on january  are possibly less fuel efficient and have increased maintenance costs compared to engines in tractors manufactured before these requirements became effective 
in addition  compliance with the more stringent epa requirements that were made effective in could result in further declines in fuel efficiency and increases in maintenance costs 
if we are unable to offset resulting increases in fuel expenses or maintenance costs with higher freight rates  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are a corporation based outside the united states 
we are a canadian based corporation with substantial operations in the united states 
changes in united states laws or the application thereof  including regulatory  homeland security or taxation  that primarily impact foreign corporations could have a material adverse effect on our prospects  business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased regulation could increase both the time and cost of transportation across the united states canada border with the result that demand for cross border transportation services may decline and our costs of providing these services may increase 
fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel may adversely impact profitability 
fuel is a significant operating expense 
we do not hedge against the risk of fuel price increases 
any increase in fuel taxes or fuel prices or any change in federal  state or provincial regulations that results in such an increase  to the extent that the increase is not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges to customers  or any interruption in the supply of fuel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 

table of contents while we have historically been able to adjust our pricing to offset changes to the cost of fuel through changes to base rates and or fuel surcharges  we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future 
in addition  we are subject to risks associated with the availability of fuel  which are subject to political  economic and market factors that are outside of our control 
we would be adversely affected by an inability to obtain fuel in the future 
although historically we have been able to obtain fuel from various sources and in the desired quantities  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
our industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations in canada and the united states  exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to numerous laws and regulations by the us department of transportation dot  environmental protection agency  internal revenue service  canada revenue agency and various other federal  state  provincial and municipal authorities 
such regulatory agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and safety  and financial reporting 
our employees and owner operators must also comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing  driver hours of service limitations  labour organizing activities  stricter cargo security requirements  tax laws and environmental matters  including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation 
we may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  ergonomics  or limits on vehicle weight and size 
we are not able to accurately predict how new governmental laws and regulations  or changes to existing laws and regulations  will affect the transportation industry generally  or us in particular 
although government regulation that affects us and our competitors may simply result in higher costs that can be passed to customers  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
any additional measures that may be required by future laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may require us to make changes to our operating practices or services provided to our customers and may result in additional costs  all of which could have an adverse effect on us 
the federal motor carrier safety administration s fmcsa compliance  safety  accountability initiative csa could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers and maintain customer relationships 
in december  the fmsca implemented csa  a new compliance and enforcement initiative designed to monitor commercial motor vehicle safety 
under csa  carriers and individual drivers are evaluated and ranked based on certain safety related standards 
our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience  which could change at any time 
in addition  the safety standards set by the fmcsa could change and affect our ability to maintain a satisfactory score 
if we obtain an unsatisfactory score it could adversely impact our relationships with customers and result in a loss of business 
csa could also cause a reduction in the driver pool as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry increasing our operating costs to attract  train and retain qualified drivers 
changes in governmental regulation may impact future cash flows and profitability 
in canada  carriers must obtain licenses issued by each provincial transport board in order to carry goods extra provincially or to transport goods within any province 
licensing from us regulatory authorities is also required for the transportation of goods between canada and the united states and within the united states 
any change in these regulations could have an impact on the scope of our activities 
there is no assurance that we will be in full compliance at all times with such policies and guidelines 
as a result  we could be required  at some future date  to incur significant costs in order to maintain or improve our compliance record 
results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in the trucking industry for a typical year  the second and third quarters usually have the highest business levels  while the first and fourth quarters generally have the lowest business levels 
the fourth quarter holiday season and adverse weather conditions generally experienced in the first quarter of the year  such as heavy snow and ice storms  have a negative impact on operating results 

table of contents if additional employees unionize  our operating costs would increase 
we have a history of positive labour relations that will continue to be important to future success 
two of our terminals in canada  representing of our labour force  are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters and the canadian auto workers association 
the collective bargaining agreements between us and our unionized employees expire on february   and on march   respectively 
there can be no assurance that the collective bargaining agreements will be renegotiated on terms acceptable or favourable to us 
there can be no assurance that other employees will not unionize in the future 
from time to time there could be efforts to organize our employees at various other terminals  which could increase our operating costs and force us to alter our operating methods 
this could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
changes to our compensation and benefits could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
like many other companies  we had implemented certain salary and wage cost initiatives in such initiatives include the suspension of our k matching program and a percent compensation reduction across all employees of the company 
the company had returned the salary and wage reduction by the beginning of the fourth quarter in however  due to the salary and wage cost initiatives that we took in  we may still find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business 
various environmental laws and regulations  and costs of compliance with  liabilities under  or violations of  existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our results 
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water 
we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
in addition  as global warming issues become more prevalent  federal and local governments and our customers are beginning to respond to these issues 
this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us 
this could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements  as well as increased indirect costs or loss of revenue resulting from  among other things  our customers incurring additional compliance costs that affect our costs and revenues 
we could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements 
these costs  changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
loss of key personnel could harm our business  operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is dependent upon the active participation of certain management personnel who have extensive experience in the industry 
the loss of the services of one or more of such personnel for any reason may have an adverse effect on our business if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of a transportation business such as ours 
our inability to successfully replace management personnel could result in a disruption to our business that could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition 

table of contents we face litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 
from time to time we face litigation regarding various alleged violations of state labor laws 
these proceedings may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
the defense of such lawsuits could result in significant expense and the diversion of our management s time and attention from operation of our business 
some or all of the amount we may be required to pay to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all these proceedings may not be covered by insurance and could have a material adverse effect on us 
exchange rate and currency risks may impact our financial results 
as we operate both in the united states and in canada  our financial results are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate relative to the currencies of other countries including the canadian dollar 
to reduce the exposure to currency fluctuations  we may enter into limited foreign exchange contracts from time to time  but these hedges do not eliminate the potential that such fluctuations may have an adverse effect on us 
in addition  foreign exchange contracts expose us to the risk of default by the counterparties to such contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our inability to successfully mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations could result in increased expenses attributable to foreign exchange loss 
insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 
our operations are subject to risks normally inherent in the freight transportation industry  including potential liability which could result from  among other circumstances  personal injury or property damage arising from accidents or incidents involving trucks operated by us or our agents 
the availability of  and ability to collect on  insurance coverage is subject to factors beyond our control 
in addition  we may become subject to liability for hazards which we cannot or may not elect to insure against because of high premium costs or other reasons  or for occurrences which exceed maximum coverage under our policies 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
increases to our premiums could further increase our insurance and claims expenses as current coverages expire or cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  or we suffer adverse development in claims compared with our reserves  or any claim exceeded the limits of our insurance coverage  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us  even if we are fully insured or held not to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
we rely on purchased transportation  making us vulnerable to increases in costs of these services 
in canada  we use purchased transportation  primarily intermodal rail from cn and cp rail  to provide cost effective service on our east west national ltl service offering 
any reduction in service by the railroads or increase in the cost of such rail services is likely to increase costs for us and reduce the reliability  timeliness and overall attractiveness of rail based services 
this would negatively impact our ability to provide our services  with the result that we may be forced to use more expensive or less efficient alternative modes of transportation to provide our services to our customers 
in the united states  we use purchased transportation primarily to handle lane imbalances and to accommodate surges in business 
we will also  on occasion  augment our linehaul capacity during certain peak periods through the use of purchased transportation 
a reduction in the availability of purchased transportation may require us to incur increased costs to satisfy customer shipping orders and we may be unable to pass along increases in third party shipping prices to our customers 
our business may be adversely affected by anti terrorism measures 
federal  state  provincial and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various anti terrorism measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks 
if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries  we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or may 
table of contents incur increased expenses to do so 
this could result in a reduction in demand for our cross border transportation services and increase the cost of providing these services  each of which could negatively impact our profitability 
there can be no assurance that new anti terrorism measures will not be implemented and that such new measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
interest rate fluctuations will impact our financial results 
in order to mitigate the exposure to interest rate risk in  we entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap contracts which expired december  management continues to evaluate our need to fix interest rate exposure 
our inability to successfully mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk could result in us being exposed to increases to interest rates  which interest rate increases would increase our operating costs 
difficulty in attracting qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to grow 
we are dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified drivers  including owner operators 
there is significant competition for qualified drivers within the trucking industry and attracting and retaining drivers has become more challenging 
if we are unable to attract drivers and contract with owner operators  we may experience shortages of qualified drivers that could result in us not meeting customer demands  pressure to upwardly adjust our driver compensation package  underutilization of our truck fleet and or use of higher cost purchased transportation  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  our growth and profitability 
our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 
we depend on our information technology systems in order to deliver reliable transportation services to our customers in an efficient and timely manner 
we have integrated the information technology and operations of our acquired companies and will integrate future acquisitions within our us ltl business unit 
any disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in delays in delivery of transportation services to our clients and increased operating costs as a result of decreased operating efficiencies  each of which could adversely impact our customer service  revenues and profitability 
while we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans  these measures cannot fully protect us from technology disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on us 
our information technology remains susceptible to outages  computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions that may inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems 
this may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in demand for our services 
integration initiatives may not realize the anticipated benefits due to operational issues  disruptions and distractions for employees and management  and potential failures in due diligence 
an increase in the cost of healthcare benefits in the united states could have a negative impact on our profitability 
we maintain and sponsor health insurance for our employees  retirees and their dependents in the united states through preferred provider organizations  and offer a competitive healthcare program to attract and retain our employees 
these benefits comprise a significant portion of our operating expenses 
lower interest rates and or lower returns on plan assets may cause increases in the expense of  and funding requirements for  our healthcare plans 
we remain subject to volatility associated with interest rates  returns on plan assets  and funding requirements 
it is possible that healthcare costs could become increasingly cost prohibitive  either forcing us to make changes to our benefits program or negatively impacting our future profitability

overview vitran corporation inc vitran or the company is a leading  predominantly non union  provider of freight surface transportation and related supply chain services throughout canada and in states in the eastern  southeastern  central  southwestern and western united states 
its business consists of two operating segments less than truckload services ltl and supply chain operation sco

depending on a customer s needs  the units can operate independently or in a complementary manner 
as is more fully described in item business  the ltl segment transports shipments in less than full trailer load quantities through freight service center networks  the sco segment provides supply chain solutions and freight brokerage services 
vitran s operating results are generally expected to depend on the number and weight of shipments transported  the prices received for the services provided  and the mix of services supplied to clients 
vitran must manage its fixed and variable operating cost infrastructure in the face of fluctuating volumes to realize appropriate margins while maintaining the quality service expected by its customers 
the long term mission of the company is to build a north american transportation infrastructure in both canada and the united states offering regional  inter regional  national  and transborder ltl services 
in conjunction with the ltl services  vitran will also focus on sco offerings that are not only profitable as stand alone business opportunities  but also increase the utilization of ltl freight service assets where appropriate

rents and leases expense increased for compared to the increase is a result of the aforementioned new tractors  leased equipment added in the milan acquisition as well as the new short term leased facilities in the newly acquired territory 
in addition  the us ltl business unit expanded into new leased facilities in south plainfield  nj and louisville  ky at the beginning of the fourth quarter

therefore  on sequential basis from march  compared to december   length of haul increased and revenue per hundredweight increased 
management expects the revenue per hundredweight and length of haul to increase in the upcoming year as the pricing environment continues to firm up and the ltl segment continues to sell services in the expanded territory 
although revenue increased in the us ltl business unit  the business unit did not perform to management expectations 
wages and purchased transportation costs were higher than expected partially attributed to the challenge of working out of the backlog of freight created by the first quarter weather issues that were further intensified by the milan acquisition which in and of itself was significantly backlogged with days of freight 
the deterioration of service as the company worked out of this backlog resulted in some loss of business and identified areas of inefficiencies within the us ltl business unit s operations

the company decreased interest spreads a minimum of basis points under the new revolving debt facility 
in addition  on november   the company entered into a new seven year cdn million real estate term credit facility  secured by specific real estate in canada 
the new real estate term facility has a fixed rate of interest at and a year amortization period 
the proceeds from the new credit facilities were used to extinguish the previous term debt and previous revolving debt facilities which were to mature in july consequently  the company wrote off million of previously capitalized financing fees and paid million in fees to complete the two new aforementioned credit facilities

the company has contractual obligations that include long term debt consisting of term debt facilities  revolving credit facilities  capital leases for operating equipment and off balance sheet operating leases primarily consisting of tractor  trailing fleet and real estate leases 
operating leases form an integral part of the company s financial structure and operating methodology as they provide an alternative cost effective and flexible form of financing 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands of dollars payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter term credit facilities   nil nil nil real estate facility revolving credit facilities  nil  nil nil capital lease obligations   nil estimated interest payments sub total off balance sheet commitments operating leases purchase obligations   nil nil nil total contractual obligations 
table of contents the company has estimated its interest obligation on its fixed and variable rate obligations 
for fixed rate debt  the fixed rate was used to determine the interest rate obligation 
for variable rate debt  the variable rate in place at december  was used to determine the total interest obligation 
the company has a contractual obligation for approximately million for the purchase of trailers in the company has commitments to finance the purchase with an operating lease 
in addition to the above noted contractual obligations  as at december   the company utilized the revolving credit facility for standby letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit are used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
export development canada edc  a crown corporation wholly owned by the government of canada  provides guarantees up to million on loc s to the company s syndicated lenders 
in so doing  the company s definition of available debt in the associated revolving credit agreement excludes loc s guaranteed by the edc 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit the company s ability to generate cash flow and affect its profitability 
the company s new asset based revolving credit agreement is subject to financial maintenance tests that trigger when certain events occur  that will require the company to achieve stated levels of financial performance  which  if not achieved  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedules 
should the current macro economic environment further destabilize  and if triggered  the company may fail to comply with the aforementioned debt covenants within the next twelve months 
assuming no significant decline in business levels or financial performance  management expects that existing working capital  together with available revolving credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund operating and capital requirements as well as service the contractual obligations 
outlook the fiscal year was another challenging year for the company  however  the north american transportation environment continued to show positive economic signs throughout the year 
vitran continued to strengthen its balance sheet by refinancing its debt at lower interest rates and reducing overall debt compared to the prior year in the face of reduced operating results 
the ltl segment plans to continue to pursue revenue and cost strategies aimed at improving service  building density at reasonable prices  reducing maintenance costs and improving productivity 
management is executing an operational plan that should improve the service and efficiency of the operation 
the most significant opportunity remains in the us ltl business unit and management s continued focus is to improve the contribution to operating results of this business unit 
furthermore  if the pricing environment continues its positive momentum and the company has the opportunity to cross sell its customers into and out of its new territory within the southern states of north carolina  south carolina  georgia  alabama and mississippi  financial results can improve 
the sco segment plans to continue to pursue new business opportunities that will maximize its existing infrastructure or expand the square footage under management 
a new dedicated contract came on line at the end of september and with an additional two to three new dedicated facilities expected in  the sco segment should outpace the prior year financial results 
furthermore  the sco segment plans to continue to introduce its existing and potential client base to the services of the ltl segment to further align the company s customers with the company s product offerings 
management believes that now more so than ever  should operational initiatives take hold  activity levels and pricing initiatives continue to improve and additional contracts in the sco segment come on line  the company is positioned to dramatically improve operating results in 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition the company s ltl and freight brokerage operations recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight expenses and direct shipment costs as incurred 
for the ltl segment transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  revenue is recognized based on relative transit time in each period with expenses recognized as incurred 
revenue for the sco segment is recognized as the management services are provided 
critical revenue related policies and estimates for the company s ltl business unit relate to revenue adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts 
critical revenue related policies and estimates for the company s sco segment include allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million or approximately of total trade receivables 
the company believes that its revenue recognition policies are appropriate and that its revenue related estimates and judgments provide a reasonable approximation of actual revenue earned 
estimated revenue adjustments generally  the pricing assessed by companies in the ltl business is subject to subsequent adjustments due to several factors  including weight and freight classification verifications  shipper bill of lading errors  pricing discounts and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
revenue adjustments are evaluated and updated based on revenue levels  current trends and historical experience 
these revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction in revenue from operations and accrued for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable that may potentially be impaired 
the company s allowance is estimated by a percentage of its aged receivables reflecting the current business environment  customer and industry concentrations  and historical experience and an additional allowance for specifically identified accounts that are significantly impaired 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated allowance 
the provision for bad debts is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported and future claims development  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health 
in establishing these accrued expenses  management evaluates and monitors each claim individually and claim frequency 
factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates help determine the appropriate reserves for the estimated liability 
changes in severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of the plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
in canada  the company has a  deductible and in the united states  self insurance retention sir per incident for auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
in the united states  the company has a  sir per incident for workers compensation and  sir per incident for employee medical 
in addition to estimates within the self insured retention  management makes judgments concerning the coverage limits 
if any claim was to exceed the coverage limits  the company would have to accrue for the excess amount 
the estimate would include evaluation whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
a claim or group of claims of this nature could have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
currently management is not aware of any claims exceeding the coverage limit 
goodwill and intangible assets the company performs its goodwill impairment test annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount to its implied fair value 
the methodology used to measure fair value is a discounted cash flow method which is an income approach  and a market approach which estimates fair 
table of contents value using market multiples of appropriate financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the transportation and logistics industry 
the fair value methods require certain assumptions for growth in earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  future tax rates  capital re investment  fair value of the assets and liabilities  and discount rate 
actual impairment of goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event goodwill is determined to be impaired  a charge to earnings would be required 
as at september   vitran completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
management establishes appropriate useful lives for all property and equipment based upon  among other considerations  historical experience  change in equipment manufacturing specifications  the used equipment market and prevailing industry practice 
management continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of property and equipment may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present  the recoverability of the assets would be assessed from the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets 
actual recoverability of assets could differ based on different assumptions  estimates or other factors 
in the event that recoverability was impaired  the fair value of the asset would be recorded and an impairment loss would be recognized 
management believes its estimates of useful lives and salvage values have been reasonable as demonstrated by the insignificant amounts of gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company and its affiliates by the board of directors or by the company s compensation committee 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with fasb asc with compensation expense amortized over the vesting period based on the black scholes merton fair value on the grant date 
the assumptions used to value stock options are dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life and anticipated forfeiture 
the company does not pay any dividends on its common shares  therefore the dividend yield is zero 
we use the historical method to calculate volatility with the historical period being equal to the expected life of each option 
this calculation is then used to approximate the potential for the share price to increase over the expected life of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the government of canada issued bond rate in effect at the time of the grant 
expected life represents the length of time the option is estimated to be outstanding before being exercised or forfeited 
historical information is used to determine the forfeiture rate 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
significant judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred tax assets that is estimated not to be realized 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million was recorded at december  accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to estimate the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
fasb asc requires that uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two step process  whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the company would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 

table of contents management judgment is also required regarding a variety of other factors  including the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
in  the internal revenue service and canada customs and revenue agency completed audits without material consequences
