table of contents to the transition from the to the these were partially offset by increases in commercial aviation services business 
bds revenues decreased by  million primarily due to lower revenues in the n ss segment 
earnings from operations the following table summarizes our earnings loss from operations dollars in millions years ended december  commercial airplanes boeing defense  space security boeing capital corporation other segment unallocated items and eliminations total operating earnings in increased by million compared with commercial airplanes earnings increased by million  primarily due to higher revenues and a reduction in research and development costs  partially offset by increases in period costs associated with business growth 
bds earnings increased by million compared with due to higher earnings in the bma and gs s segments  partially offset by lower earnings in the n ss segment 
other segment earnings increased by million primarily due to a million reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables during unallocated items and eliminations in reduced earnings by million compared with primarily due to higher pension and postretirement costs 
operating earnings in increased by  million compared with commercial airplanes earnings increased by  million  primarily due to  million of costs related to the first three flight test aircraft included in research and development expense in and the reach forward losses on the program of  million 
bds earnings decreased by million compared with due to lower margins in the bma segment and lower revenues in the n ss segment 
other segment earnings decreased by million primarily due to million in intercompany guarantees related to aircraft impairment charges and reduced aircraft collateral values 
the most significant items included in unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  share based plans deferred compensation pension postretirement eliminations and other total share based plans expense decreased by million in both and primarily due to the expiration of the sharevalue trust at june  deferred compensation expense decreased by million and million in and the year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions 

table of contents eliminations and other unallocated items expense decreased by million in and increased by million in primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items 
expense also includes a million charitable contribution 
unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for us government contracting purposes 
we recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of  million   million and  million in   and  respectively 
the increase in net periodic benefit costs related to pensions and other postretirement benefits is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates 
not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period 
a portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense 
the unallocated expense in includes million of additional expense recorded during the third quarter due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years accumulated postretirement benefit obligations 
see the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in note to our consolidated financial statements 
earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and other unallocated items and eliminations 
dollars in millions pension other postretirement benefits years ended december  allocated to business segments other unallocated items and eliminations total other earnings items dollars in millions years ended december  earnings from operations other income expense  net interest and debt expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations other income decreased by million in due to lower interest rates 
the increase of million in was driven by investment income on higher cash and investment balances 
interest and debt expense decreased by million in due to the replacement of debt at lower interest rates 
the increase of million in was due to debt issued in our effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was lower in than in primarily due to an income tax charge of million recorded during the first quarter of as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act  as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of during  our effective tax rate was reduced by due to a tax benefit of million 
table of contents recorded as a result of settling the federal audit 
we do not expect to settle any outstanding federal audits in our effective tax rate was higher in than  primarily because pre tax book income in was higher than in and because of the income tax charge of million recorded during the first quarter of this was partially offset by a tax benefit of million recorded during the fourth quarter of as a result of settling the federal audit

backlog our backlog at december was as follows dollars in millions contractual backlog commercial airplanes boeing defense  space security boeing military aircraft network space systems global services support total boeing defense  space security total contractual backlog unobligated backlog contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options  announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed  and unobligated us and us government contract funding 
the increase in contractual backlog during and was due to commercial airplane orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation for undelivered commercial airplanes 
unobligated backlog includes us and us government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized 
the decrease in unobligated backlog during is due to decreases at bds of  million compared with primarily due to funding of existing multi year contracts and termination for convenience by the us army of the brigade combat team modernization bctm program  partially offset by the us air force usaf contract for the kc a tanker and the missile defense agency development and sustainment contract 
the decrease in unobligated backlog during is due to decreases at bds of  million compared with primarily due to funding of existing multi year contracts including the v  bctm and chinook programs  partially offset by multi year procurement contract awards on the f a and international space station programs 
additional considerations kc a tanker on february   we were awarded a contract from the usaf to design  develop  manufacture and deliver next generation aerial refueling tankers 
the kc a tanker will be a derivative of our commercial aircraft 
this contract is a fixed price incentive firm contract valued at billion and involves highly complex designs 
changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge 
this contract contains production options 
if all options under the contract are exercised  we expect to deliver aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately billion 
for segment reporting purposes  backlog  revenues and costs are recorded in the commercial airplanes and bma segments 

table of contents segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment political turmoil in the middle east  the march natural disasters in japan  the european sovereign debt crisis  deficit reduction challenges in the united states and high fuel prices continue to impact the global economy and airline traffic and costs 
in the face of these challenges  passenger traffic has generally been more resilient than air cargo traffic 
air cargo traffic began contracting in may  and full year estimates indicate no growth over in contrast  passenger traffic year over year growth is expected to average around  above the long term average of 
however  there continues to be significant performance variation between regions and airline business models  with emerging markets and low cost carriers leading in the passenger markets 
despite relatively resilient passenger traffic  net profits for the global airline industry were impacted in by high oil prices  which were approximately higher  on average  than prices 
net profits for the global airline industry are expected to be modest this year  totaling billion in  reduced from billion in airlines continue to focus on boosting revenue through alliances and partnerships and ancillary fees and services  while also cutting costs and renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes in a high fuel price environment 
these airline strategies helped the airlines weather the global uncertainty in current baseline forecasts for the economy and traffic suggest the outlook is for continued net profitability for the global airline industry in  although expectations are that profits will be substantially lower than current estimates for demand for commercial aircraft is also influenced by the availability of aircraft financing including export financing and other financing sources 
going into the european sovereign debt crisis remains a significant risk to the global economy and the airline industry 
the long term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade  globalization  and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries 
our year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of per year for passenger and cargo traffic  based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 
based on long term global economic growth projections  and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  we project a trillion market for  new airplanes over the next years 
the industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes  credit market shocks  terrorism  natural disasters  conflicts  and increased global environmental regulations 
industry competitiveness the commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
market liberalization in europe and asia has enabled low cost airlines to continue gaining market share 
these airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 
continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns 
approximately of commercial airplanes contractual backlog  in dollar terms  is with us airlines 
we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share 
they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers 
airbus has 
table of contents historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours 
regional jet makers embraer and bombardier  coming from the less than seat commercial jet market  continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes 
additionally  other competitors from russia  china and japan are likely to enter the to seat airplane market over the next few years 
many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government provided financial support  including launch aid  which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible 
this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors  and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years 
worldwide  airplane sales are generally conducted in us dollars 
fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors  all of whom have significant costs in other currencies 
changes in value of the us dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits 
competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker us dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity  thereby improving their longer term competitive posture 
airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings  a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through if the us dollar strengthens  airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development  gain market share through pricing and or improve earnings 
we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts 
we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support  spares  training  maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world 
this enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity 
these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively 
operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings loss from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog revenues year over year changes in revenue are shown in the following table dollars in millions vs 
vs 
new airplane sales commercial aviation services other total 
table of contents revenues for increased by  million or compared with due to higher new airplane deliveries  including the impact of entry into service of the and freighter  favorable commercial airplane delivery model mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues 
the increase in revenues from commercial aviation services was primarily due to increased sales of spares 
revenues for decreased by  million or compared with the decrease in new airplane revenues primarily reflects lower deliveries resulting from a production rate change from to per month beginning in june and no deliveries on the program due to the transition from the to the derivative 
the increase in revenues from commercial aviation services business was primarily due to increased sales of spares 
commercial airplanes deliveries as of december were as follows total cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries includes intercompany deliveries of airplanes in  airplanes in both and earnings from operations earnings from operations for increased by million compared with this increase reflects earnings of million from higher revenues on new airplane deliveries  million of higher earnings due to commercial aviation services volume and margins and million of lower research and development expense  partially offset by increases of million reflecting higher fleet support costs and other costs associated with business growth 
earnings from operations for increased by  million compared with the increase was primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of costs related to the first three flight test airplanes  and the reach forward losses on the program 
costs of  million included in research and development expense in for the first three flight test airplanes were a result of our determination that these airplanes could not be sold 
the reach forward loss on the program of  million during was primarily due to increased production costs  reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the the remaining net decrease in earnings for was primarily attributable to increased research and development expense of million and lower new airplane deliveries 
backlog firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before boeing and the customer are required to perform 
backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain  such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors  shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements 
all such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain 
firm orders exclude options 
a number of our customers may have 
table of contents contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays 
we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise 
however  once orders are included in firm backlog  orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled  although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers 
the increase in contractual backlog during and was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation  partially reduced by cancellations of orders 
the increase in unobligated backlog in represents commercial airplanes share of the usaf contract for the kc a tanker 
accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts 
it is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program s life 
estimation of each program s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program  including firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies 
we review our program accounting quantities quarterly 
the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates  all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered 
the table below provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of december cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet airplane deliveries plus undelivered firm orders 
program program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders the initial accounting quantity for the program was established in the third quarter of program the accounting quantity for the program increased by  units in due to the program s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes 
during  we announced plans to increase monthly production from to airplanes per month beginning in and a further increase to airplanes per month beginning in on june   to address continued demand for delivery positions  we announced plans to increase production of the to airplanes per month beginning in on august   we announced the launch of the max  the new engine variant of the first delivery of the max is expected in 
table of contents program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units in the freighter was certified during the third quarter and first delivery occurred in october first flight of the intercontinental passenger derivative occurred in march and type certification was achieved in the fourth quarter of during  expected first delivery of the intercontinental was moved from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of due to a delay in flight testing and the time required to incorporate all flight test driven engineering and design changes 
we remain focused on incorporating these and other changes identified during flight testing into completed airplanes  achieving a planned production rate increase from to airplanes per month in mid  reducing out of sequence work and improving supply chain efficiency 
we are also continuing to monitor cargo market conditions 
if risks associated with these areas cannot be mitigated  the program could be impacted by customer claims  lower orders  supplier assertions and or the recognition of an additional reach forward loss 
we continue to implement mitigation plans and cost reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks 
program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units in due to the program s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes 
program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units in due to the program s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes 
the program s first delivery at airplanes per month from per month occurred in june a further increase to airplanes per month is planned for the first quarter of program we completed initial type certification flight testing activities and received design and production certifications for the during the third quarter of we delivered the first airplane in september and delivered two additional aircraft in the fourth quarter of we also completed the critical design review for the derivative in in october we announced that the expected date of first delivery of the had moved to early from late we continued to produce aircraft during flight testing and established a separate facility to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during flight testing on already completed aircraft 
we expect that aircraft completed in our everett facility through mid year will also require change incorporation 
however  we expect that these later airplanes will require significantly less change incorporation than airplanes completed prior to we remain focused on achieving planned increases in production rates while continuing to satisfy customer mission and performance requirements 
we also continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft assembly  including management of our extended global supply chain  incorporation of design changes into aircraft in various stages of assembly  completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration 
during we increased the production rate to per month at our everett final assembly line and started up the north charleston final assembly line 
we currently expect to increase the production rate of aircraft to aircraft per month in final assembly by the end of with first deliveries occurring at that rate in early our efforts to achieve planned production rate targets include improving the production system  coordinating rate increases with suppliers  increasing production rates in both everett and north charleston  and establishing transitional surge capacity at everett 
in addition  we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of prior schedule changes  including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions 
during  we concluded that the first three flight test aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft 
as a result  costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense 
we believe that the other three flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those airplanes in program inventory at december  if we determine that one or more of the other aircraft cannot be sold  we may incur additional charges 

table of contents during the third quarter of  we established an initial accounting quantity of  units  representing approximately years of production at planned production rates 
the cumulative impacts of production challenges  change incorporation  schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability 
as a result  we have recorded low margins on our deliveries 
future challenges  including not meeting one or more planned production rate increases going forward  or introducing the derivative as scheduled  could result in additional customer claims and or supplier assertions as well as result in further pressures on program profitability and or a reach forward loss 
we continue to implement mitigation plans and cost reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks 
fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation 
collectively known as fleet support services  these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane 
they include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services  information services and systems and technical data and documents 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
these costs are expected to continue to increase due to the and entry into service 
research and development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs 
logo our research and development expense decreased by million in this was primarily due to certification of the freighter and our research and development expense decreased by  million in this was primarily due to the reclassification to research and development expense of  million of production costs related to the three flight test airplanes in  partially offset by a million increase of other research and development expense 
additional considerations the and programs highlight the risks inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes  including  for example  development of the in the third quarter of we launched a variant of the that will feature new more fuel efficient engines the max 
costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred 
costs to produce new airplanes are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting 
airplane programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity 
generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery 
each customer purchase agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery 
a price escalation formula based on pre defined factors is used to determine the final price of the airplane at the time of customer delivery 
while firm fixed price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings  they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns 
many new airplanes and derivatives have highly 
table of contents complex designs  utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners 
as technical or quality issues arise  such as issues experienced on the and programs  we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative airplanes 
additionally  price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future 
there are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach forward losses 
these include changes to the program accounting quantity  customer and model mix  production costs and rates  capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity  learning curve  anticipated cost reductions  flight test and certification schedules  costs  schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims  supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations 
while we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  order cancellations or other financially significant exposure 
boeing defense  space security business environment and trends us defense environment overview in august  the budget control act the act reduced the dod top line budget by approximately billion over years starting in fiscal year fy in addition  barring congressional action  further budget cuts or sequestration as outlined in the act will be implemented in fy sequestration would lead to additional reductions of approximately billion from the pentagon s top line budget over the next decade  resulting in aggregate reductions of about trillion over years 
the us dod has taken the position that such reductions would generate significant operational risks and require the termination of certain procurement programs 
overseas contingency operations funding for iraq and afghanistan is also expected to decrease due to the reduction of us forces in those countries 
in january  the dod announced its defense strategic guidance dsg partly in response to these budgetary challenges 
in response to the proposed across the board budget cuts the dsg proposed that the dod prioritize the asia pacific and middle east regions  shrink ground forces  maintain nuclear deterrence  and reduce cold war assets 
the dsg also emphasizes the increasing importance of command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr  cyber  space  special operations  and unmanned systems in implementing the dod s strategic imperatives 
specific program allocations commensurate with this new guidance are expected to be announced in february as part of the president s fy budget request 
while the dsg s proposals do incorporate some of the proposed funding reductions  they do not address the full impact that would be associated with sequestration pursuant to the act 
the budgetary pressures described above are expected to impact our other us customers  including nasa  and the intelligence community 
to meet the needs of the dod and other us government customers in this challenging environment  bds offers a balanced portfolio of platforms  services  and solutions that meet operational and fiscal requirements 
however  these budgetary pressures are expected to place significant downward pressure on our revenues and margins in target market environment overview the dsg places strong emphasis on developing and acquiring specific capabilities for the us armed forces 
capabilities expected to remain a focus of investment or increase per the dod strategic guidance include cisr  cyber  space  special operations  and unmanned systems 
bds has been anticipating this shift in dod priorities and has aligned its strategy accordingly 
as such  we have been making organic investments and pursuing targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and better serve our customers and their emerging needs in these markets 

table of contents international environment overview the international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and the need for countries to modernize aging inventories 
western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets 
in europe  the continuing financial crisis and the growing potential for a double dip recession are causing a contraction in the credit market and forcing governments to institute austerity measures that will negatively impact defense spending in the near term 
the strongest opportunities for growth of the bds portfolio will be in the middle east and asia pacific regions where the relative financial strength of key countries coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats will result in procurement of defense and security systems 
similar to the domestic environment  bds offers proven capability  predictable price  and near term availability that are well suited to the enduring requirements in the international marketplace 
bds realignment effective january   and  certain programs were realigned among bds segments 
business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment 
operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules  the operating results of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings  may not be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  depending on the customer and their funding sources  our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts  or as one large multi year order or long term award 
as a result  period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
revenues bds revenues increased by million in compared with  due to higher revenues in the bma and the gs s segments  partially offset by lower revenues in the n ss segment 
bds revenues decreased by  million in compared with  due to lower revenues in all three segments  with the largest decrease in the n ss segment 
operating earnings bds operating earnings in increased by million compared with primarily due to higher earnings in the bma and gs s segments  partially offset by lower earnings in the n ss segment 
bds operating earnings in decreased by million compared with primarily due to lower margins in the bma segment and lower revenues in the n ss segment 

table of contents backlog total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding  and unobligated backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated 
bds total backlog decreased by in  from  million to  million  primarily due to funding of existing multi year contracts and termination for convenience by the us army of the bctm program  partially offset by new orders 
for further details on the changes between periods  refer to the discussions of the individual segments below 
additional considerations our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges 
many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements 
in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished 
examples of these programs include family of beyond line of sight terminals  p a and proprietary programs 
some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis 
many of these programs have highly complex designs 
as technical or quality issues arise  we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts  which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price  either of which could result in a material charge 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  the loss of satellite in orbit incentive payments  or other financially significant exposure 
these programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues 
examples of our fixed price development programs include airborne early warning and control aew c  india p i  usaf kc a tanker and commercial and military satellites

lower reach forward losses of million on kc international tanker program and lower research and development also contributed to the earnings improvements 
bma operating earnings decreased by million in primarily due to lower deliveries of c aircraft and less favorable pricing and mix on the c program 
research and development the bma segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge  technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighter s enduring needs 
research and development expense decreased in primarily due to lower international tanker development costs 
research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures  system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to better prepare us to meet customers needs in us and international growth areas such as military commercial derivatives  rotorcraft  global strike  missiles and unmanned airborne systems  and surveillance and engagement systems 
the products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products 
investments support vertical integration of our product line in areas such as autonomous operation of unmanned systems  advanced sensors and electronic warfare 
these efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness  interoperability  reliability and reducing the cost of ownership

additional considerations aew c the aew c development program  also known as wedgetail in australia  peace eagle in turkey and peace eye in the republic of korea  consists of aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems  some of which have never been installed on an airplane before 
a total of five wedgetail aircraft have been delivered to australia with initial customer acceptance 
four were delivered in and one in september the final wedgetail aircraft is scheduled for delivery with initial customer acceptance in the first quarter of final customer acceptance for all six wedgetail aircraft is also scheduled to be completed during the first half of in january  the peace eagle program began the formal test phase which is scheduled to conclude in the second half of the first peace eye aircraft was delivered to the republic of korea in september and the second in december during  and  we recorded charges increasing the reach forward losses on the aew c programs in australia and turkey by million  million and million  respectively 
these are advanced and complex fixed price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability 
we believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  however  the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed  either of which could result in lower margins or additional material charges

boeing capital corporation business environment and trends bcc s customer financing and investment portfolio at december  totaled  million 
a substantial portion of bcc s portfolio is concentrated among certain us commercial airline customers 
bcc s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across boeing aircraft product types most notably out of production boeing aircraft such as aircraft 

table of contents bcc provided customer financing of million and million during and the european sovereign debt crisis poses a financing risk to airlines and may reduce overall levels of commercial aircraft financing 
however  we expect the reduction in funding from european commercial banks to be largely offset by increased financing availability from other sources  such as capital markets  lessors  and banks from other regions of the world 
aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service

bankruptcies on november   american airlines  inc american airlines filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
american airlines retains certain rights by operating under chapter bankruptcy protection  including the right to reject executory contracts  such as aircraft leases 
at december  american airlines accounted for million of our customer financing portfolio  including million recorded by bcc 
american airlines has not rejected any of the leases related to our aircraft 
we believe that our customer financing receivables from american airlines are sufficiently collateralized such that we do not expect to incur losses related to those receivables as a result of the bankruptcy 
we continue to monitor the american airlines bankruptcy for potential impacts on our business 
restructurings and restructuring requests from time to time  certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with bcc

our investment in gross inventories increased to  million at december   up from  million at december  while advances and progress billings increased to  million at december  compared with  million at december  the increase in inventory was driven by higher investments in commercial airplane program inventory  specifically inventory  while higher advances and progress payments reflect increased production rates and commercial airplane orders 
we expect inventory to grow at a lower rate in as additional deliveries offset the ramp up of commercial airplane production and as design changes are incorporated into completed and airplanes 
cash contributions to our pension plans totaled million and million in and investing activities cash provided by investing activities totaled  million during compared with  million used during  primarily due to lower investments in time deposits during in  capital expenditures totaled  million up from  million in capital spending in is higher than due to the construction of a final assembly factory and related site buildings in north charleston  south carolina  higher spending to support commercial airplane production rate increases and capital improvements

capital resources we have substantial borrowing capacity 
any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below 
we and bcc have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity 
throughout and at december   neither we nor bcc had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
currently  we have  million  million exclusively available for bcc of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements 
we anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings 
financing commitments totaled  million and  million as of december  and december  we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers 
historically  we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments 
however  there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required 
in the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities  our commercial aircraft financing commitments  unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies  or other business requirements  we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt 
we believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short term and long term commitments and plans  and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year 
however  there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  under our commercial paper program  in the debt markets or our credit facilities 
at december  and  our pension plans were  million and  million underfunded as measured under gaap 
on an erisa basis our plans were approximately funded at december  with minimal required contributions in we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately  million in we may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities 
the most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets as defined in the credit agreements  and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital as defined 
when considering debt covenants  we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity

estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts 
purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  specify a fixed  minimum or range of quantities  specify a fixed  minimum  variable  or indexed price provision  and specify approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position 
approximately of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts 
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position include agreements for inventory procurement  tooling costs  electricity and natural gas contracts  property  plant and equipment  and other miscellaneous production related obligations 
the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts 
we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery 
these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting 
some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments 
in these limited cases  we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above 

table of contents purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation 
industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the us to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us 
these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology or other forms of assistance 
however  in certain cases  our commitments may be satisfied through other parties such as our vendors who purchase supplies from our non us customers 
we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments 
during  we incurred no such penalties 
as of december   we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling billion that extend through purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above 
to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us  a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
income tax obligations as of december   our net asset for income taxes receivable  including uncertain tax positions  was million 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions

critical accounting policies contract accounting we use contract accounting to determine revenue  cost of sales  and profit for almost all of our bds business 
contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract  which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages 
for each contract  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized 
due to the size  duration and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or index based clauses 
the majority of these contracts are with the us government 
generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit 
federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price 
total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustments to the contract s inception to date revenues  cost of sales and profit  in the period in which such changes are made 
changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach forward loss or an adjustment to a reach forward loss  which would be recorded immediately as a charge to earnings 
for the years ending december   and cumulative catch up adjustments  including reach forward losses  across all bds contracts increased operating earnings by million  million and million respectively 
significant adjustments recorded during the three years ended december  relate to reach forward losses on the aew c and the kc international tanker programs 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if the combined gross margin for all contracts in bds for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
in addition  a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach forward loss position 
changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings 

table of contents program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts 
for each program  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer 
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity  sales price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured part costs  major component costs  overhead costs  program tooling and other non recurring costs  and routine warranty costs 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity  added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates  consistent with typical sales contract terms 
cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers  historical performance trends  and business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  customer and or supplier claims or assertions  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 
to ensure reliability in our estimates  we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis  when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity  a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity 
the program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program 
because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non recurring costs  new commercial aircraft programs  such as the program  typically have lower margins than established programs 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs  excluding the and programs  for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
the program is in a reach forward loss position having recorded a total of  million of reach forward losses in and absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs  subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin 
reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity  whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately 
any such increases could result in additional charges 
the program has a low single digit profit margin 
the cumulative impacts of the production challenges  schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts continue to place significant pressure 
table of contents on revenues  costs and the profitability of the program 
the scale and duration of the program is such that relatively minor changes in assumptions or variables could have a material effect on our reported results in any period if the program is determined to have a reach forward loss 
aircraft valuation allowance for losses on customer financing receivables the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables valuation provision is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio 
the estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors  including historical loss experience  collateral values  and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings  collateral values and default rates 
if each customer s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the collateral values were higher or lower at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the cumulative default rates used for each rating category increased or decreased  the allowance would have increased or decreased by million 
impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for re lease we evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value 
we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates  lease terms  residual value of the asset  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset 
when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been lower  we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december  residual values equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease 
estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december   and a future cumulative pre tax earnings reduction of approximately million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods  of which approximately million would be recognized in our investment in sales type finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income 
declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   we estimate that we would have reduced pre tax income by million for the year ended december  
table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairments goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
april is our annual testing date 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
we completed our assessment of goodwill as of april  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value 
changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill 
as of december  and  we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations 
we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and tradenames 
any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment 
a decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite lived intangible assets by less than million 
postretirement plans the majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans 
all nonunion and some union employees hired after december  are not covered by defined benefit plans 
we also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents 
accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets 
these measurements are based upon several assumptions  including the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate rate of growth for medical costs 
future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense  projected benefit obligations and shareholders equity 

table of contents the following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate as of december  dollars in millions change in discount rate increase bps change in discount rate decrease bps pension plans projected benefit obligation net periodic pension cost other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return 
a decrease or increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension expense by million 
we expect net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately million and the portion recognized in earnings for to increase by approximately billion primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate from at december  to at december  and amortization of actuarial losses 
absent increases in interest rates  higher asset values and or higher contributions  net periodic pension cost will increase further in future years 
the assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year s expense  recorded liabilities and shareholders equity 
the following table shows the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change as of december  dollars in millions change in medical trend rate increase bps change in medical trend rate decrease bps other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
additionally  bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of bcc s liabilities with that of bcc s assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates 
as of december   the impact over the next months of a basis point immediate and sustained rise or fall in interest rates would be a million increase or a million decrease to bcc s pre tax earnings 
for purposes of the foregoing sensitivity analysis  we assume that the level of our floating rate assets and debt including the impact of derivatives remain unchanged from year end and that they are all subject to immediate re pricing 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes 
based on the portfolio of other boeing fixed rate debt  the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
the investors in our fixed rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by million and a decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
