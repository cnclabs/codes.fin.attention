item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
liquidity and capital resources and commitments historically  we have funded our operations  acquisitions  exploration and development expenditures from cash generated by operating activities  bank borrowings and issuance of common stock 
our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to secure our revolving line of credit 
we do not have any delivery commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of our oil and gas under any existing contract or agreement 
our long term strategy is on increasing profit margins while concentrating on obtaining reserves with low cost operations by acquiring and developing oil and gas properties with potential for long lived production 
we focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalties in areas with significant development potential 
during the fiscal year ended march   we repurchased  shares for the treasury at an aggregate cost of  we had working capital of  as of march  compared to working capital of  as of march   an increase of for the year ending march   cash flow from operations was  an increase when compared to the corresponding period of fiscal cash of  was used for additions to oil and gas properties   was used for net reduction of long term debt and  was received primarily from the sale of a term leasehold interest in oil and gas properties 
accordingly  net cash increased in march  we purchased approximately working interest net revenue interest in gross acres containing five wells in the fuhrman mascho field of andrews county  texas  for an approximate cash purchase price of  funded from our million credit facility 
during fiscal  we participated in the drilling of two development wells on this acreage 
our share of the costs to drill and complete these wells through march was approximately  this acreage now contains seven wells four producing oil from the san andres formation and three producing oil from the grayburg and san andres formations at an approximate depth of  feet 
all of these wells are operated by cone and petree oil gas exploration  inc this property contains an additional nine potential drill sites in the grayburg and san andres formations with more dense spacing of approximately acres per well 
six of these potential sites are planned to be drilled in fiscal this new spacing in the fuhrman mascho field has been shown to increase production 
in march  we purchased an additional working interest in this acreage for an approximate cash purchase price of  we now own a total approximate working interest net revenue interest in this acreage 
in june  we received  in cash from energen corporation for the assignment of a five year term leasehold interest in acres at  per acre 
the assignment covers depths of  to  feet from the surface 
mexco retained a royalty of 
this interest has potential for oil production from the avalon and bone springs in separate intervals by horizontal drilling above the prolific vermejo fusselman gas field of loving county  texas 
energen has plans to drill three wells on this acreage during our fiscal  one of these wells began drilling in april we participated in infill wells in the yeso paddock formations of the dodd federal unit in the grayburg san andres jackson field of eddy county  new mexico 
twenty three of these wells have already been drilled with the balance scheduled to be drilled in the next twelve months to a total depth of approximately  feet 
the unit  operated by concho resources  inc  currently contains approximately producing wells 
mexco s working interest in this unit 

net revenue interest 
our share of the costs to drill and complete these wells through march was approximately  for the fiscal year ending march   we participated in the drilling of producing wells in this unit 
a joint venture in which we are a working interest partner drilled two infill wells in the strawn formation on a acre tract in andrews county  texas 
the section in which this tract is located currently contains completed wells on acre spacing 
our share of the costs to drill and complete these wells through march for our approximately working interest was approximately  a joint venture in which we are a working interest partner drilled two development wells in the delaware and bone spring sand formations on a acre tract in eddy county  new mexico which currently contains four producing wells 
our share of the costs to drill and complete the first of these wells through march for our approximately working interest was approximately  we participated in the drilling of two development wells in the cotton valley bossier formation in the teague field of freestone county  texas 
the acre unit  operated by valence operating company  currently contains producing wells 
mexco s working interest in this unit is net revenue interest 
our share of the costs to drill and complete these wells through march was approximately  a joint venture in which we are a working interest partner drilled two infill wells in the strawn formation on a acre tract in glasscock county  texas 
the immediate offsetting sections in which this tract is located currently contains completed wells 
our share of the costs to drill and complete these wells through march for our approximately working interest was approximately  two joint ventures in which we are a working interest partner began drilling three development wells in lea county  new mexico 
one well is on a acre tract and is to be completed in the abo formation 
the other two wells are on a acre tract which contains six wells currently producing and are to be completed in bone spring sand formation 
our share of the costs to drill and complete these wells through march for our approximately working interest was approximately  we acted as operator and drilled a development well in pecos county  texas in which mexco owns working interest net revenue interest 
this well is currently being completed 
our costs to drill this well through march  were approximately  at march   we reported estimated puds of bcfe  which accounted for of our total estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
this figure primarily consists of a projected new wells  of which we operate  and new zone behind pipe from a currently producing wellbore that we also operate 
we project two operated wells to be drilled in fiscal with the three remaining in fiscal regarding the remaining pud locations operated by others  a location is currently being prepared to drill one well with plans for seven wells to follow in and five in we are participating in other projects and are reviewing projects in which we may participate 
the cost of such projects would be funded  to the extent possible  from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations 
the remainder may be funded through borrowings on the credit facility and  if appropriate  sales of our common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na crude oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years 
the effect of declining product prices on our business is significant 
lower product prices reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves 
lower product prices also offer us less incentive to assume the drilling risks that are inherent in our business 
the volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example in the last twelve months  the west texas intermediate wti posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per bbl in september to a high of per bbl in april the henry hub spot market price henry hub for natural gas has ranged from a low of per mmbtu in march to a high of per mmbtu in june on march  the wti posted price for crude oil was per bbl and the henry hub spot price for natural gas was per mmbtu 
management is of the opinion that cash flow from operations and funds available from financing will be sufficient to provide adequate liquidity for the next fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net income was  for the year ended march   a increase from  for the year ended march  oil and gas sales 
revenue from oil and gas sales was  for the year ended march   a increase from  for the year ended march  this resulted from an increase in oil price and production partially offset by a decrease in gas price and production 
the following table sets forth our oil and gas revenues  production quantities and average prices received during the fiscal years ended march difference oil revenue volume bbls average price per bbl gas revenue volume mcf average price per mcf production and exploration 
production costs were  in fiscal  a decrease from  in fiscal this was primarily the result of last year s workover and repairs on one of our operated wells in hutchinson county  texas in which we own a working interest 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense was  in fiscal  a decrease from  in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in gas production partially offset by an increase to the full cost pool amortization base and a decrease in gas reserves partially offset by an increase in oil reserves 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended march   an increase from  for the year ended march  this was primarily due to an increase in stock option compensation expense 
interest expense 
interest expense was  in fiscal  a decrease from  in fiscal  due to a decrease in borrowings 
income taxes 
there was an income tax benefit of  in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal this benefit was mainly the result of an increase in intangible drilling costs 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net income was  for the year ended march   as compared to net income of  for the year ended march  oil and gas sales 
revenue from oil and gas sales was  for the year ended march   a decrease from  for the year ended march  this resulted from a decrease in oil and gas production and partially offset by an increase in oil and gas prices 
the following table sets forth our oil and gas revenues  production quantities and average prices received the fiscal year ended march difference oil revenue volume bbls average price per bbl gas revenue volume mcf average price per mcf production and exploration 
production costs were  in fiscal  a decrease from  in fiscal this was primarily the result of a decrease in production taxes due to the decrease in oil and gas sales 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense was  in fiscal  a decrease from  in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in production and an increase in reserves partially offset by an increase to the full cost pool amortization base 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended march   a increase from  for the year ended march  this was primarily due to an increase in stock option compensation expense offset by a decrease in legal fees from the previous year for preparation of the form s interest expense 
interest expense was  in fiscal  a increase from  in fiscal  due to an increase in borrowings 
income taxes 
there was an income tax benefit of  in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal the benefit was primarily a result of a change in estimate related to the statutory depletion carryforward upon completion of the tax return 
contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our future payments we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of march  payments due in total less than year years years contractual obligations secured bank line of credit does not include estimated interest of  less than year and  years 
these amounts represent the balances outstanding under the bank line of credit 
these repayments assume that interest will be paid on a monthly basis and that no additional funds will be drawn 
alternative capital resources although we have primarily used cash from operating activities and funding from the line of credit as our primary capital resources  we have in the past  and could in the future  use alternative capital resources 
these could include joint ventures  carried working interests and the sale of assets and or issuances of common stock through a private placement or public offering of our common stock 
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing financial statements  management makes informed judgments  estimates and assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes  fair value and determination of proved reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in crude oil and natural gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
the carrying amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aro when incurred 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher dd a rate on our crude oil and natural gas properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us more susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
our crude oil and natural gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
ceiling test 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test to determine a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas properties increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher crude oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
estimates of our proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrates  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows are derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines by an independent engineering firm based in part on data provided by us 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the cost ceiling represents the present value discounted at of net cash flows from sales of future production using the average price over the prior month period 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost projects 
use of estimates 
in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make informed judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  significant estimates are used in determining year end proved oil and gas reserves 
although management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
the estimate of our oil and natural gas reserves  which is used to compute dd a and impairment of oil and gas properties  is the most significant of the estimates and assumptions that affect these reported results 
excluded costs 
oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
these costs are excluded until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate 
revenue recognition 
we recognize crude oil and natural gas revenue from our interest in producing wells as crude oil and natural gas is sold from those wells  net of royalties 
we utilize the sales method to account for gas production volume imbalances 
under this method  income is recorded based on our net revenue interest in production taken for delivery 
asset retirement obligations 
the estimated costs of plugging  restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated by the units of production method 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in the full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the revised rules are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that aligns the fasb s oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the new sec rule revisions 
the accounting standards revised the definition of proved reserves to permit consideration of new technologies in evaluating oil and natural gas reserves  require the use of an average price based on the prior twelve month period rather than year end prices  permit the disclosure of probable and possible oil and gas reserves  require the reporting of the qualifications and measures taken to assure the independence and objectivity of any business entity or employee primarily responsible for preparing or auditing the reserves estimates  and  revise the disclosure requirements for oil and gas operations 
the final rules and new guidance are effective for fiscal years ending on or after december  mexco adopted these requirements as of march  and the results of the adoption are contained herein 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
asu no 
clarifies application of fair value measurements and disclosure requirements and is effective for mexco as of april  we do not believe the guidance will have an impact on our fair value measurement and disclosures 
there were various other accounting standards and interpretations issued during our fiscal year  all of which have been determined to be not applicable or significant by management and once adopted are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary source of market risk for us includes fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
all of our financial instruments are for purposes other than trading 
at march   we had not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other similar agreements relating to crude oil and natural gas 
interest rate risk 
on march   we had an outstanding loan balance of  under our million revolving credit agreement  which bears interest at an annual rate equal to the british bankers association london interbank offered rate bba libor daily floating rate  plus percentage points 
if the interest rate on our bank debt increases or decreases by one percentage point our annual pretax income would change by  based on borrowings at march  credit risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by other parties of their contractual obligations 
our primary credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized 
at march   our largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was  or of our total oil and gas receivables 
we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance from any of our working interest partners 
at march   our largest credit risk associated with any working interest partner was  or of our total trade receivable 
we have not experienced any significant credit losses 
energy price risk 
our most significant market risk is the pricing for natural gas and crude oil 
our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices with any certainty 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
factors that can cause price fluctuations include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall political and economic conditions in oil producing countries 
declines in oil and natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
changes in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional capital for our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
in addition  a noncash write down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if prices declined significantly  even if it is only for a short period of time 
see critical accounting policies and estimates ceiling test under item of this report on form k 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that can be produced economically 
thus  we may experience material increases or decreases in reserve quantities solely as a result of price changes and not as a result of drilling or well performance 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other 
our financial results are more sensitive to movements in natural gas prices than oil prices because most of our production and reserves are natural gas 
if the average oil price had increased or decreased by one dollar per barrel for fiscal  our oil and gas revenue would have changed by  if the average gas price had increased or decreased by one dollar per mcf for fiscal  oil and gas revenue would have changed by
