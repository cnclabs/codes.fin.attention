company overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative small molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and immune mediated diseases 
our corporate mission statement reads as follows to build a viable biopharmaceutical company that designs  develops and commercializes novel therapies intended to improve quality of life  increase duration of life and resolve serious medical healthcare needs  to identify promising product candidates based on exceptional scientific development expertise  develop our products in a rapid  cost efficient manner and to pursue commercialization and or development partners when and where appropriate 
we exist to make a difference for the better and these are important times to do that 
presently  we have three product candidates in clinical development and several preclinical molecules in lead optimization 
we are committed to high standards of ethics  scientific rigor  and operational efficiency as we move each of these programs toward potential commercialization 
to date  nearly all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products  and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we do not anticipate the generation of any product commercial revenue until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals to launch one of our products 
we were in the development stage at june   as defined in financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  development stage entities 
during the fiscal year ended june   we exited the development stage with the signing of our first significant collaboration with janssen biotech  inc janssen see note to the consolidated financial statements  from which we received our first significant revenue from principal operations  reflective that we are no longer in the development stage 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing arrangements as well as regulatory and marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products  or partner collaborations  generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our sustaining profitability depends upon our ability to successfully complete the development of our products  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products 
ibrutinib formerly pci bruton s tyrosine kinase btk inhibitor for oncology ibrutinib is an orally active selective irreversible inhibitor of btk that we are developing for the treatment of patients with b cell malignancies lymphoma or leukemias 
b cell maturation is mediated by b cell receptor bcr signal transduction and btk is an essential part of the bcr signaling pathway 
recently  btk has been demonstrated to affect a number of vital growth and survival processes in cancerous b cells 

table of contents ibrutinib clinical development update during fiscal year we provided updates on several of our clinical programs at major scientific conferences 
the following is a summary of the clinical updates provided at the american society of hematology annual meeting in december  we presented interim results of our phase ii study in mantle cell lymphoma mcl patients 
in the phase ii study pcyc  ibrutinib was administered orally at mg daily until disease progression 
efficacy data was reported on patients patients had bortezomib naive disease  patients had previously received bortezomib who had post baseline tumor assessments and were thus evaluable for response 
the objective response rate orr  according to the non hodgkin s lymphoma international working group criteria  was patients 
orr was similar in bortezomib naive and bortezomib exposed patients and  respectively 
at the time of the analysis of responding patients had ongoing responses at the median follow up of months 
consistent with previous trials of ibrutinib  the most common adverse events reported in this trial were grade mild or moderate fatigue  diarrhea and nausea 
three patients discontinued the study at that time due to adverse events regardless of causality 
at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology asco in june  we presented for the first time data of our single agent phase ib ii study in the treatment naive cohort in chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma cll sll patients 
the phase ii study pcyc included a total of treatment naive elderly years patients with cll sll enrolled at two daily dose levels of ibrutinib  mg n and mg n  respectively 
at the median follow up of months in the mg cohort  the overall response rate  including complete and partial responses  was as measured by the international workshop on chronic lymphocytic leukemia iwcll criteria 
notably  complete response no evidence of disease as measured by radiographic  blood and bone marrow was achieved in n patients with ibrutinib as a single agent 
the clinical responses complete and partial have been independent of high risk clinical or genetic features 
at the median follow up of months  the probability of progression free survival pfs was in the mg cohort 
the study safety profile of ibrutinib was particularly notable for minimal off target toxicities  consistent with earlier trials 
the most common adverse events were grade diarrhea  nausea and fatigue 
grade and grade hematologic events potentially related to ibrutinib occurred in of patients 
of the patients on the trial at the time of the analysis  there was only patient that had discontinued due to disease progression 
the first results of phase ii study pcyc were also presented at asco in june and included a total of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma prolymphocytic leukemia cll sll pll n and richter s transformation n that were treated in cohort one  in which ibrutinib mg was followed by concomitant ofatumumab with continued ibrutinib until progression 
the combination was well tolerated  as indicated by reports that the majority of adverse events were grades no new safety signals were identified 
at the time of the analysis for the cll sll pll patients  the overall response rate  as measured by iwcll criteria  and the progression free survival probability were both at the median follow up of months 
also at the time of the analysis  of cll sll pll patients remained on study and only patient had discontinued treatment by proceeding to stem cell transplant 
the results of this phase ii study  as presented at asco in june  included achievement of tumor response  rapid onset of response  low relapse rate and a favorable safety profile which make this combination worthy of further study 
cohorts evaluating other therapeutic sequences with ofatumumab and ibrutinib are currently underway 
the phase ii study pcyc was also presented at asco in june and enrolled a total of patients treated with a combination of bendamustine and rituximab  were considered refractory treatment free interval months to a purine analog eg fludarabine containing regimen and refractory to bendamustine 
patients received ibrutinib in combination with bendamustine rituximab 
the combination therapy was well tolerated and there were no discontinuations due to adverse events 
at the median follow up of months  the progression free survival probability was 
the overall response rate was 
only patients had reported progressive disease at the time of the analysis  an additional patients had proceeded to stem cell transplant and patients remained on study 

table of contents the phase ii study pcyc was also presented at the th congress of the european hematology association eha in june this single agent study included a total of patients with cll sll relapsed refractory patients and treatment naive patients enrolled at two daily dose levels of ibrutinib mg and mg 
in addition to the data reported june  at asco on the treatment naive patients  this oral presentation provided updated pfs data in the relapsed refractory patient population 
at the median follow up of months  the progression free survival probability in the mg cohort was 
high risk relapsed refractory patients with p deletion n and immunoglobulin variable heavy chain igvh unmutated status n  had an estimated month pfs of and  respectively at the time of the analysis 
the phase ii study pcyc was further updated during eha in june of in addition to the ibrutinib plus br data reported at asco the fcr combination study cohort n was presented 
it required patients to be fludarabine naive and due to poor enrollment the cohort was suspended 
at the median follow up of months all three patients had achieved an objective response  with two patients achieving minimal residual disease negative mrd negative complete responses and at the time of analysis all patients remained progression free 
the other ongoing phase ib ii programs for ibrutinib also include the following clinical studies in lymphoma and myeloma the phase ii study pcyc using ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl completed enrollment in calendar q with patients 
this study is designed to assess the activity of ibrutinib in two genetically distinct subtypes of dlbcl  the activated b cell abc subtype and the germinal center gc subtype 
the company will evaluate over the next months the data generated by this ongoing phase ii study to prepare a clinical development plan for ibrutinib in dlbcl 
we are encouraged by preliminary signals from our phase i single agent trial  pcyc  in follicular lymphoma and are currently developing a phase ii program in this histology 
the phase ii study pcyc using ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma mm started enrollment in calendar q the company will evaluate over the next months the data generated by this ongoing phase ii study to prepare a clinical development plan for ibrutinib in mm 
based on preclinical data of effects on the myeloma microenvironment as well as direct effects on malignant myeloma cells  we believe that btk represents a viable therapeutic target in mm 
we have also initiated the first pivotal phase iii study in cll sll 
the phase iii randomized controlled study  resonatetm is designed to demonstrate superiority of ibrutinib to ofatumamab in relapsed or refractory cll sll with a primary endpoint of progression free survival 
the study is anticipated to enroll patients that will be randomized the trial is designed to demonstrate superiority of ibrutinib with respect to a progression free survival endpoint 
our partner janssen has initiated the following studies phase iii study of ibrutinib in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed refractory cll sll a randomized  multi center phase iii  double blinded  placebo controlled  registration trial of ibrutinib in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in relapsed refractory cll sll patients who received at least one line of prior systemic therapy 
the primary endpoint of the study is to demonstrate a clinically significant improvement in progression free survival versus bendamustine and rituximab therapy alone 
the key secondary endpoints include overall response rate  overall survival and other measures of clinical benefit 
this global study is initiated by janssen and janssen plans to enroll patients worldwide 

table of contents phase iii study outside the us of ibrutinib versus temsirolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who have received one prior therapy a randomized  multi center phase iii registration trial of ibrutinib in relapsed refractory mcl patients who received at least one prior rituximab containing chemotherapy regimen 
the primary endpoint of the study is progression free survival when compared to temsirolimus 
the key secondary endpoints include overall response rate  overall survival rate and other measures of clinical benefit 
this study  initiated by janssen  will be conducted outside the us and janssen plans to enroll patients 
phase ii study of ibrutinib in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who progress after bortezomib therapy a single arm  multi center phase ii trial of ibrutinib in relapsed refractory mcl patients who received at least one prior rituximab containing chemotherapy regimen and who progressed after bortezomib therapy 
the primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate 
the key secondary endpoints include duration of response  progression free survival rate  and other measures of clinical benefit 
this global study  conducted by janssen  is open and janssen plans to enroll patients worldwide 
phase ii dose escalating study of ibrutinib in combination with r chop in patients with newly diagnosed diffused large b cell lymphoma the purpose of this study is to identify if  and at what dose  ibrutinib may be administered with r chop and to document responses of this combination in patients with newly diagnosed diffused large b cell lymphoma 
this multi center global study  conducted by janssen  is open and janssen plans to enroll up to patients 
pci factor viia inhibitor our factor viia inhibitor pci is a novel first in human small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets fviia 
as an inhibitor of fviia  pci has two potential mechanisms of action inhibition of intracellular signaling involved in tumor growth and metastases and inhibition of early coagulation processes associated with thromboembolism 
factor viia pci clinical development update a multicenter phase i ii of pci in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that are either receiving or are planned to receive gemcitabine therapy has completed enrollment 
the phase ii portion of the study randomized patients to receive either gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine plus pci mg kg twice daily 
the objectives are to assess the safety of fviia inhibitor pci at pharmacologically active dose levels  to assess potential inhibition of tumor progression and to obtain initial information of the effects on the incidence of thromboembolic events 
data from initial efficacy analysis is expected to report out late due to a paradigm shift away from the use of gemcitabine alone for the treatment of pancreatic cancer  enrolling patients in this randomized study has been challenging 
pcyc is evaluating other alternatives for development of this agent 
abexinostat formerly pci histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor abexinostat is an orally dosed  broad spectrum  hydroxamic acid based small molecule hdac inhibitor that is under evaluation in phase i and ii clinical trials for refractory solid tumors and lymphoma by pharmacyclics and its ex us partner  les laboratoires servier of paris  france servier

our collaboration partner for ex us markets  servier  has initiated seven phase i ii trials in europe and asia in lymphomas and solid tumors with abexinostat as single agent and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin  liposomal doxorubicin and folfox 
the phase ii portion of servier s single agent lymphoma trial was opened in q of calendar further analysis of these trials and any updates may be released by servier 
we are subject to risks common to pharmaceutical companies developing products  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  uncertainty of market acceptance of our products  history of and expectation of future operating losses  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights and the need for future capital 
in order for a product to be commercialized  we must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  build a us commercial capability  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may adversely affect the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue under our license and collaboration arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
determinations of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for deliverables and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for any new or modified transactions  revenue recognized could be adversely affected 
our collaborations prior to july  with multiple elements were evaluated and divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria were met  including whether the delivered element had stand alone value and whether there was verifiable objective and reliable evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we received was combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting when criteria for separation were not met 
amounts received under such arrangements consisted of up front collaboration payments  periodic milestone payments and payments for research activities 
up front payments under agreements that included future performance requirements were recorded as deferred revenue and were recognized over the performance period 
the performance period was estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is reevaluated at each reporting period 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
revenue related to substantive  at risk collaboration milestones are recognized upon achievement of the event specified in the underlying agreement 
revenue for research activities are recognized as the related research efforts are performed 
we recognize revenue related to collaboration and license arrangements in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  or asc topic additionally  we adopted  effective july   accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which amended asc topic and provided guidance on how deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting  required an entity to determine the selling price of a separate deliverable using a hierarchy of i vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  ii third party evidence  or tpe  or iii best estimate of selling price  or besp  and required the allocation of the arrangement consideration  at the inception of the arrangement  to the separate units of accounting based on relative fair value 
we evaluate all deliverables within an arrangement to determine whether or not they provide value on a stand alone basis 
based on this evaluation  the deliverables are separated into units of accounting 
the arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based their relative selling prices 
we may exercise significant judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting  as well as in estimating the selling prices of such unit of accounting 

table of contents to determine the selling price of a separate deliverable  we use the hierarchy as prescribed in asc topic based on vsoe  tpe or besp 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
tpe is determined based on third party evidence for a similar deliverable when sold separately and besp is the price at which we would transact a sale if the elements of collaboration and license arrangements were sold on a stand alone basis 
we may not be able to establish vsoe or tpe for the deliverables within collaboration and license arrangements  as we do not have a history of entering into such arrangements or selling the individual deliverables within such arrangements separately 
in addition  there may be significant differentiation in these arrangements  which indicates that comparable third party pricing may not be available 
we may determine that the selling price for the deliverables within collaboration and license arrangements should be determined using besp 
the process for determining besp involves significant judgment on our part and includes consideration of multiple factors such as estimated direct expenses and other costs  and available data 
for collaborations entered into after july   we have determined besp for license units of accounting based on market conditions  similar arrangements entered into by third parties and entity specific factors such as the terms of previous collaborative agreements  our pricing practices and pricing objectives  the likelihood that clinical trials will be successful  the likelihood that regulatory approval will be received and that the products will become commercialized 
we have also determined besp for services related deliverables based on the nature of the services to be performed and estimates of the associated effort as well as estimated market rates for similar services 
for each unit of accounting identified within an arrangement  we determine the period over which the performance obligation occurs 
revenue is then recognized using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when the level of effort to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measurement of performance 
effective july   we adopted asu no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition  or asu  which provides guidance on revenue recognition using the milestone method 
under the milestone method  a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
the determination that a milestone is substantive is subject to considerable judgment 
research and development research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and amortized over the period that the goods are delivered or the related services are performed  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flow 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 

table of contents our worldwide collaboration and license agreement with janssen includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated development activities 
except in certain cases  in general janssen is responsible for approximately of development costs and we are responsible for the remaining of development costs see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to account for cost sharing payments to janssen as a component of research and development expense and reimbursements for development services under the cost sharing arrangement as an offset to research and development expense  upon delivery of the related services when expenses have been incurred and reimbursements have been earned 
we have purchased quantities of drug substances that are expected to be used in the future to support our clinical development 
until the commercial viability of such products has been demonstrated and the necessary regulatory approvals received  we will continue to charge all such amounts to research and development expense 
share based compensation share based compensation cost for employee stock options is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
the accounting grant date for employee stock options with performance obligations is the date on which the performance goals have been defined and a mutual understanding of the terms has been reached 
generally options with performance obligations vest over a four year period  with the goals set and agreed upon annually 
share based compensation for non employee stock options is re estimated at each period end through the vesting date 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term for each of our employee options  non employee options and our employee stock purchase plan is calculated for and applied to one group of grants as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior among our employee or non employee population 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the our options 
options vest upon the passage of time or a combination of time and the achievement of certain performance obligations 
the compensation committee of the board of directors will determine if the performance conditions have been met 
share based compensation expense for the options with performance obligations is recorded when the company believes that the vesting of these options is probable

table of contents results of operations revenue the following table summarizes our revenue over the last three fiscal years in thousands license and milestone revenue collaboration services revenue total revenue in december  we received an upfront payment of  from janssen under the collaboration and license agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the revenue related to the payment was allocated  to the licenses   to the committee services and  to the development services 
total revenue related to the janssen agreement for the year ended june  was  and consisted of  of license revenue which is included in license and milestone revenue and  of collaboration services revenue 
for the year ended june   the collaboration services revenue related to the janssen agreement was comprised of  amortization of committee services and  of amortization of development services 
as of june   approximately  was included in deferred revenue related to the committee and development services  of which  was included in deferred revenue non current 
the  and  allocated to committee and development services  respectively  is being recognized as revenue as the related services are provided over the estimated service periods of years and years  which are equivalent to the estimated remaining life of the underlying technology and the estimated remaining development period  respectively 
we recorded   and  in revenue in the years ended june   and  respectively  associated with our collaboration and license agreement with servier which was entered into in april for the year ended june   total revenue related to the servier agreement consisted of  of milestone revenue which was included in license and milestone revenue and  of collaboration services revenue 
in april  we received a  advance development milestone payment from servier 
in october  the related milestone was reached and we recognized the  as revenue in the year ended june  of the total revenue for the year ended june    represented amortization of the  upfront payment from servier received in april and the remainder represented the pro rata completion of services associated with research payments  our supply commitment and reimbursement of patent expenses 
the collaboration and license agreement required us to enter into an agreement to supply drug product for servier s use in clinical trials 
as the supply agreement was considered part of the arrangement we deferred recognition of all revenue under the servier collaboration agreement until the supply agreement was completed and executed in our fiscal second quarter 
of the total revenue for the year ended june    represents amortization of the  upfront payment from servier received in april included in the servier revenue recognized in fiscal was  which represents the pro rata portion of revenue attributable to the period from april ie  the signing of the collaboration agreement to june   had the supply agreement been completed in april the remaining fiscal revenue of  represents the pro rata completion of services attributable to payments of  from servier associated with research payments  our supply commitment and reimbursements of patent expenses 
research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our research and development r d expenses over the last three fiscal years in thousands change change r d expenses 
table of contents research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product  the direct costs attributable to each product and total indirect costs for each respective period 
in the near term  we expect to hire additional employees  as well as incur costs under our collaboration agreements as we continue to invest in the development of our products see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and cost of completing a product development phase  see the risk factors discussed in this annual report

table of contents the increase of  in interest and other income expense  net  for the year ended june  compared with the year ended june   was primarily due to higher interest income from higher invested balances during the year and the absence of interest expense in income taxes the following table summarizes the income tax provision benefit over the last three fiscal years in thousands income tax provision benefit at june   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in federal and state tax credit carry forwards of  and  respectively  are available to offset future taxable income 
the federal tax credits will begin to expire in state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
we are tracking the portion of our net operating losses attributable to stock option benefits in a separate memo account pursuant to asc therefore  these amounts are no longer included in our gross or net ending deferred tax assets 
pursuant to asc  the stock option benefits of approximately  will be only recorded to equity when they reduce cash taxes payable

in december  we received a  upfront payment from our collaboration and license agreement with janssen 
the collaboration and license agreement provided us with the potential to receive future milestone payments of up to  on august   we announced that we had triggered the first  milestone payment obligation from janssen under the collaboration and license agreement as a result of our enrollment of a fifth patient in our international phase iii randomized  multicenter  open label clinical trial of ibrutinib versus ofatumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory cll sll 
on august   we announced that we had triggered the second  milestone payment obligation from janssen under the collaboration and license agreement as a result of the enrollment of a fifth patient in our single arm  multi center phase ii trial of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory mcl 
we may receive up to an additional  in development and regulatory milestone payments  for total potential upfront and milestone payments of  however  clinical development entails risks and we have no assurance as to whether or when the milestone targets might be achieved see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business now celera corporation a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated 
future milestone payments under the agreement  as amended  could total as much as  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
approximately two thirds of the milestone payments relate to our hdac inhibitor program and approximately one third relates to our factor viia program 
approximately of the potential future milestone payments would be paid to celera after obtaining regulatory approval in various countries 
there are no milestone payments related to our btk program 
in addition to the milestone payments  celera will be entitled to royalty payments based on annual sales of drugs commercialized from our hdac inhibitor  factor viia and certain btk inhibitor programs 

table of contents based upon the current status of our product development plans and our collaboration with janssen  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
we expect research and development expenses  as a result of on going and future clinical trials  to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
due to our extensive drug programs we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we may raise additional funds through the public or private sale of securities  bank debt  partnership collaboration or otherwise 
if we are unable to secure additional funds  whether through sale of our securities  debt or partnership collaborations  we will have to delay  reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our product development programs 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval  continued progress of our research and development programs  our ability to maintain and establish collaborative arrangements with third parties  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the amount and timing of capital equipment purchases  and competing technological and market developments 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be highly dilutive  or otherwise disadvantageous  to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms  would require us to reduce our operating expenses and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements to develop our product candidates and to continue operations  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our primary non cancelable contractual obligations as of june  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase commitments total purchase commitments consist of non cancellable orders to purchase drug material 
in february  we entered into an amendment of our facilities lease agreement which added an additional  square feet of leased space  giving us a total of  square feet 
the amendment included an abatement of the monthly rent of the additional facility for the first months  limited to  the lease includes an option to extend the lease term for five years 
the amended lease expires in november 
table of contents our collaboration and license agreement with janssen includes a cost sharing arrangement for certain development activities 
except in certain cases  in general janssen is responsible for approximately of development costs and we are responsible for the remaining of development costs see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our potential future commitments under the janssen collaboration and license agreement are excluded from the above table because we cannot reasonably predict the amount and timing of such payments to janssen as the payments are contingent upon future events 
in addition  we have entered into various agreements and purchase orders related to our clinical trials and general operations which have been excluded from the above table because they are cancellable prior to the date of delivery 
in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business now celera corporation a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated 
future milestone payments we could be required to make under the agreement  as amended  could total as much as approximately  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
in addition  celera will also be entitled to royalty payments based on annual sales of certain drugs commercialized from these programs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we generally maintain investments at an average maturity of less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  and  would have potentially declined by approximately  and  respectively 
the table below presents the fair value of our marketable securities at june  and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates matures in fiscal year marketable securities weighted average interest rate 
table of contents foreign currency risk all of our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended june   primarily related to ex us clinical trial activities  and we expect to continue to do so 
we have not entered into any agreements or transactions to hedge the risk associated with potential fluctuations in currencies  accordingly  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk related to these ex us clinical trial activities 
while we may enter into hedge or other agreements in the future to actively manage this risk  we do not believe this risk is material to our financial statements
