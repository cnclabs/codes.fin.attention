the company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above and other risks described from time to time in the company s filings with the sec could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements 
the company does not undertake and specifically declines any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed assets the company believes that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates of  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss once loans default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
in addition  the bank s regulators could require additional provisions for loan losses as part of their examination process 
the bank s latest annual regulatory examination was completed in december additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in item business allowances for losses on loans and foreclosed assets 
inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships 
from time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance  cash flow of the borrower  value of collateral  or other factors 
in these instances  management may have to revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances 
in some cases  additional losses may be realized  in other instances  the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit 
for the periods included in these financial statements  management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses has not changed significantly 
in addition  the company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management s best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets 
while the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties  the amount that the company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in these financial statements  resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
carrying value of fdic covered loans and indemnification asset the company considers that the determination of the carrying value of loans acquired in the march   september  and october  fdic assisted transactions and the carrying value of the related fdic indemnification assets involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of the acquired loans and the fdic indemnification assets reflect management s best ongoing estimates of the amounts to be realized on each of these assets 
the company determined initial fair value accounting estimates of the assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations 
however  the amount that the company realizes on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in its financial statements  based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods 
because of the loss sharing agreements with the fdic on these assets  the company should not incur any significant losses 
to the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates  the indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss sharing support from the fdic 
subsequent to the initial valuation  the company continues to monitor identified loan pools and related loss sharing assets for changes in estimated cash flows projected for the loan pools  anticipated credit losses and changes in the accretable yield 
analysis of these variables requires significant estimates and a high degree of judgment 
see note of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a process that estimates the fair value of each of the company s reporting units compared with its carrying value 
the company defines reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed 
as of december   the company has two reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated the bank and the travel division which is a division of a subsidiary of the bank 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then no impairment is recorded 
if the carrying value amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  further testing is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values to those assets to their carrying values 
at december   goodwill consisted of  at the bank reporting unit and  at the travel reporting unit 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to seven years 
at december   the amortizable intangible assets consisted of core deposit intangibles of million at the bank reporting unit and  of non compete agreements at the travel reporting unit 
these amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value 
see note of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  the company used a market approach to value its reporting units 
the market approach applies a market multiple  based on observed purchase transactions for each reporting unit  to the metrics appropriate for the valuation of the operating unit 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment may include developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
based on the company s goodwill impairment testing  management does not believe any of its goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired as of december  while the company believes no impairment existed at december   different conditions or assumptions used to measure fair value of reporting units  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the company s impairment evaluation in the future 
current economic conditions the current economic environment presents financial institutions with unprecedented circumstances and challenges which  in some cases  have resulted in large declines in the fair value of investments and other assets  constraints on liquidity and significant credit quality problems  including severe volatility in the valuation of real estate and other collateral supporting loans 
the company s financial statements have been prepared using values and information currently available to the company 
given the volatility of current economic conditions  the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements could change rapidly  resulting in material future adjustments in asset values  the allowance for loan losses  or capital that could negatively impact the company s ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity 
current economic conditions have impacted the markets in which we operate 
throughout our market areas  the economic downturn negatively affected consumer confidence and elevated unemployment levels 
consequently  average prices for existing home sales in the midwest  which includes our market areas  were down in over according to the national association of realtors 
in turn  this can potentially increase related losses upon foreclosure due to depressed values 
higher vacancy rates have negatively impacted cash flows on commercial real estate loans 
retail  office and industrial types of commercial real estate properties had vacancy rates that averaged  and  respectively  in the company s primary markets for according to real estate services firms cbre and cassidy turley 
these vacancy rates in the company s primary markets are up from averages of  and  respectively  for  prior to the economic downturn 
according to real estate services firms colliers international  jones lang lasalle and cassidy turley  national averages were  and  respectively  for  up from  and for  prior to the economic downturn 
increased vacancy rates for commercial real estate properties can correlate to fewer commercial land development sales because of the risk involved in developing these types of properties when similar completed properties have vacancies 
the missouri unemployment rate declined during the year ended december  from at december  to at december   on a preliminary basis  and was below the national average of at december  the iowa and kansas unemployment rates also declined during the year ended december  from and at december   respectively  to and at december   respectively 
loan types specifically impacted by certain market areas in missouri include loans secured by condominiums and condominium development in the st 
louis  central missouri and branson market areas 
borrowers with loans secured by condominiums and condominium development are now changing business strategies to remarket units for rent as opposed to sale 
the st 
louis market area has experienced the highest level of unemployment among our market areas  with unemployment rates at  on a preliminary basis  and at december  and  respectively 
however  we have a minimal level of one to four family residential and consumer loans in this market and the negative impact of the economy specific to this area has generally been in condominium loans as previously discussed 
the unemployment rate for the springfield market area was below the national average  on a preliminary basis  at at december   and overall lending activity has improved somewhat but is still below historic levels 
general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income  as well as provisions for loan losses and the level of non interest income and non interest expense 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the bank earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
in the year ended december   great southern s total assets increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  full details of the current year changes in total assets are provided in the comparison of financial condition at december  and december  section of this annual report on form k 
loans 
in the year ended december   great southern s net loans increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  the increase was primarily due to the loans acquired in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction during which totaled million at december  excluding loans covered by loss sharing agreements  commercial real estate loans also increased million  or  other commercial loans increased million  or  and multi family residential loans increased million  or 
commercial construction loans also increased but the increase was primarily offset by decreases in subdivision construction and land development loans 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in net loans acquired through the fdic assisted transactions of million  or  primarily because of loan repayments 
as loan demand is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  and because of the competition we face and our focus on pricing discipline and credit quality  we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in prior years 
the net loan growth experienced during the year ended december   excluding the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction  may continue into however  based upon the current lending environment and economic conditions  the company does not expect to grow the overall loan portfolio significantly at this time 
the company s strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels 
of the total loan portfolio at december  and  and  respectively  was secured by real estate  as this is the bank s primary focus in its lending efforts 
at december  and  commercial real estate and commercial construction loans were and of the bank s total loan portfolio excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted transactions  respectively 
commercial real estate and commercial construction loans generally afford the bank an opportunity to increase the yield on  and the proportion of interest rate sensitive loans in its portfolio 
they do  however  present somewhat greater risk to the bank because they may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy generally 
at december  and  loans made in the springfield  mo 
metropolitan statistical area springfield msa were and of the bank s total loan portfolio excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted transactions  respectively 
the company s headquarters are located in springfield and we have operated in this market since because of our large presence and experience in the springfield msa  many lending opportunities exist 
however  if the economic conditions of the springfield msa were worse than those of other market areas in which we operate or the national economy overall  the performance of these loans could decline comparatively 
at december  and  loans made in the st 
louis  mo 
metropolitan statistical area st 
louis msa were and of the bank s total loan portfolio excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted transactions  respectively 
the company s expansion into the st 
louis msa in may provided an opportunity to not only expand its markets and provide diversification from the springfield msa  but also provided access to a larger economy with increased lending opportunities despite higher levels of competition 
loans made in the st 
louis msa are primarily commercial real estate  commercial business and multi family residential loans which are less likely to be impacted by the higher levels of unemployment rates  as mentioned above under current economic conditions  than if the focus were in one to four family residential and consumer loans 
for further discussions of the bank s loan portfolio  and specifically  commercial real estate and commercial construction loans  see item business lending activities 
the percentage of fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted transactions has increased from in to in due to customer preference for fixed rate loans during this period of low interest rates 
of the total amount of fixed rate loans in our portfolio  mature within one to five years and therefore are not considered to create significant long term interest rate risk for the company 
fixed rate loans make up only a portion of our balance sheet and our overall interest rate risk strategy 
as of december   our internal interest rate risk models indicated a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is fairly neutral 
for further discussion of our interest rate sensitivity gap and the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk how we measure the risks to us associated with interest rate changes 
for discussion of the risk factors associated with interest rate changes  see risk factors we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
while our policy allows us to lend up to of the appraised value on single family properties and up to on two to four family residential properties  originations of loans with loan to value ratios at that level are minimal 
when they are made at those levels  private mortgage insurance is typically required for loan amounts above the level or our analyses determined minimal risk to be involved and therefore these loans are not considered to have more risk to us than other residential loans 
we consider these lending practices to be consistent with or more conservative than what we believe to be the norm for banks our size 
at december  and december   an estimated and  respectively  of total owner occupied one to four family residential loans had loan to value ratios above at origination 
at december  and december   an estimated and  respectively  of total non owner occupied one to four family residential loans had loan to value ratios above at origination 
at december  troubled debt restructurings totaled million  or of total loans  up million from million  or of total loans  at december  at december   troubled debt restructurings totaled million  or of total loans 
at december  and  the company had no loans that were modified in troubled debt restructurings 
this increase over the past five years is primarily due to the economic downturn and the resulting increased number of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 
concessions granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal  forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection 
while the types of concessions made have not changed as a result of the economic recession  the number of concessions granted has increased as reflected in the increase in troubled debt restructurings 
during the year ended december   twelve loans totaling million were each restructured into multiple new loans 
during the year ended december   four loans totaling million were each restructured into multiple new loans 
for further information on troubled debt restructurings  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
the loss sharing agreements with the fdic are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered  and are conditioned upon the bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the fdic  including requirements regarding servicing and other loan administration matters 
the loss sharing agreements extend for ten years for single family real estate loans and for five years for other loans 
at december   approximately seven years remain on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from teambank and the remaining loans are expected to repay within two to eleven years 
at december   approximately eight years remain on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from vantus bank and the remaining loans are expected to repay within two to thirteen years 
at december   approximately ten years remain on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from sun security bank and the remaining loans are expected to repay within eight years 
at december   approximately two years remain on the loss sharing agreement for non single family loans acquired from teambank and the remaining loans are expected to repay within two to three years 
at december   approximately three years remain on the loss sharing agreement for non single family loans acquired from vantus bank and the remaining loans are expected to repay within two to five years 
at december   approximately five years remain on the loss sharing agreement for non single family loans acquired from sun security bank and the remaining loans are expected to repay within three years 
while the expected repayments for certain of the acquired loans extend beyond the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the bank has identified and will continue to identify problem loans and will make every effort to resolve them within the time limits of the agreements 
the company may sell any loans remaining at the end of the loss sharing agreement subject to the approval of the fdic 
acquired loans are currently included in the analysis and estimation of the allowance for loan losses 
however  when the loss sharing agreements end  the allowance for loan losses related to any acquired loans retained in the portfolio may need to increase 
the loss sharing agreements and their related limitations are described in detail in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
the level of non performing loans and foreclosed assets affects our net interest income and net income 
while we did not have an overall high level of charge offs on our non performing loans prior to  we generally do not accrue interest income on these loans and do not recognize interest income until the loans are repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loans 
generally  the higher the level of non performing assets  the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income 
we expect the loan loss provision  non performing assets and foreclosed assets will generally remain elevated and will fluctuate from period to period 
in addition  expenses related to the credit resolution process could also remain elevated 
available for sale securities 
in the year ended december   available for sale securities increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the increase was due in part to the acquisition of securities totaling million through the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction during the increase was also due to net purchases of mortgage backed securities which increased million from million at december  to million at december  these securities were purchased for pledging to secure public fund deposits and customer reverse repurchase agreements and also to earn higher yields as compared to holding the funds in cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  a decrease of million  or  from million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during was due to increased loan funding  purchases of available for sale securities and redemption of brokered deposits  partially offset by the cash received from the fdic in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction 
foreclosed assets 
foreclosed assets totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  foreclosed assets  excluding those covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic  increased from million  or of total assets  at december  to million  or of total assets  at december  foreclosed assets began increasing in as the united states economy slowed due to a severe economic recession in and during and  economic growth was slow and residential and commercial real estate markets recovered only slightly  if at all 
the levels of net additions to foreclosed assets during  while still elevated  were lower than in the last four years 
because sales of foreclosed properties have been slower than additions  total foreclosed assets increased in each of the last four years 
the trend of higher additions and lower sales due to the economy is magnified in the subdivision construction and land development categories where properties are more speculative in nature and market activity has been very slow 
see non performing assets foreclosed assets for additional information on the company s foreclosed assets 
deposits 
the company attracts deposit accounts through its retail branch network  correspondent banking and corporate services areas  and brokered deposits 
the company then utilizes these deposit funds  along with federal home loan bank fhlbank advances and other borrowings  to meet loan demand or otherwise fund its activities 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of the million of core deposits assumed from sun security bank in the fdic assisted transaction during including the deposits assumed from sun security bank  interest bearing transaction accounts increased million  non interest bearing checking accounts increased million and retail certificates of deposit increased million 
total brokered deposits decreased million  primarily because of million of brokered deposits that matured or were called by the company during included in total brokered deposits at december  and december   were great southern bank customer deposits totaling million and million  respectively  that are part of the cdars program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the fdic deposit insurance limit 
the fdic considers these customer accounts to be brokered deposits due to the fees paid in the cdars program 
the company did not actively try to grow cdars customer deposits during the current period and decreased interest rates offered on these deposits during year ended december  our deposit balances may fluctuate from time to time depending on customer preferences and our relative need for funding 
in  we experienced an overall decline in deposits which corresponded with the decrease in loans receivable 
because of overall low loan demand and increased liquidity levels in  when compared to historic trends  we chose to allow our deposit balances to decrease 
as discussed previously regarding  this was primarily done by redeeming brokered cds without replacement and by allowing higher cost cdars accounts to decrease by offering lower rates or redeeming them 
the transition in deposit types from time deposits to transaction deposits benefits our net interest margin by generally reducing our cost of funds 
we do not consider our retail certificates of deposit to be guaranteed long term funding because customers can withdraw their funds at any time with minimal interest penalty 
when loan demand begins trending upward  we can increase rates paid on deposits to increase deposit balances and may again utilize brokered deposits to provide necessary funding 
because the federal funds rate is already very low  there may be a negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the company s inability to lower its funding costs significantly in the current low interest rate environment  although interest rates on assets may decline further 
the sun security bank and other core deposits added during helped the company lower overall funding costs 
however  because market interest rates are already very low  it may be difficult for the company to further lower its funding costs significantly  while interest rates on assets may decline further 
the level of competition for deposits in our markets is high 
while it is our goal to gain checking account and retail certificate of deposit market share in our branch footprint  we cannot be assured of this in future periods 
increasing rates paid can help to attract deposits if needed  however  this method could negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
our ability to fund growth in future periods may also be dependent on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and fhlbank advances 
in times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits  we have utilized brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund these loans 
these funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create variable rate funding  if desired  which more closely matches the variable rate nature of much of our loan portfolio 
while we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods  if this should happen  the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
net interest income and interest rate risk management 
our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by market interest rate changes 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the prime rate of interest and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts subject to the effect of loan interest rate floors  which are discussed below 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in addition  our net interest income may be impacted by changes in the cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools 
as described in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  the company s evaluation of cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools is on going and increases in cash flow expectations are recognized as increases in accretable yield through interest income 
decreases in cash flow expectations are recognized as impairments through the allowance for loan losses 
the current level and shape of the interest rate yield curve poses challenges for interest rate risk management 
the frb last cut interest rates on december  great southern has a significant portfolio of loans which are tied to a prime rate of interest 
some of these loans are tied to some national index of prime  while most are indexed to great southern prime 
the company has elected to leave its great southern prime rate of interest at 
this does not affect a large number of customers  as a majority of the loans indexed to great southern prime are already at interest rate floors which are provided for in individual loan documents 
but for the interest rate floors  a rate cut by the frb generally would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as the federal funds rate adjusts 
loans at their floor rates are subject to the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance elsewhere at the lower market rate  however 
because the federal funds rate is already very low  there may also be a negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the company s inability to lower its funding costs significantly in the current environment  although interest rates on assets may decline further 
conversely  interest rate increases would normally result in increased interest rates on our prime based loans 
the interest rate floors in effect may limit the immediate increase in interest rates on these loans  until such time as rates rise above the floors 
however  the company may have to increase rates paid on deposits to maintain deposit balances 
the impact of the low rate environment on our net interest margin in future periods is expected to be fairly neutral 
as our time deposits mature in future periods  we expect to be able to continue to reduce rates somewhat as they renew 
however  any margin gained by these rate reductions is likely to be offset by reduced yields from our investment securities as payments are made on our mortgage backed securities and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 
similarly  interest rates on adjustable rate loans may reset lower according to their contractual terms and new loans may be originated at lower market rates 
for further discussion of the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk how we measure the risks to us associated with interest rate changes 
the negative impact of declining loan interest rates has been mitigated by the positive effects of the company s loans which have interest rate floors 
at december   the company had a portfolio excluding the loans acquired in the fdic assisted transactions of prime based loans totaling approximately million with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest 
of this total  million also had interest rate floors 
these floors were at varying rates  with million of these loans having floor rates of or greater and another million of these loans having floor rates between and 
in addition  there were million of these loans with floor rates between and 
at december   all million of these loans were at their floor rates 
the loan yield for the total loan portfolio was approximately  and basis points higher than the national prime rate of interest at december   and  respectively  partly because of these interest rate floors 
while interest rate floors have had an overall positive effect on the company s results during this period  they do subject the company to the risk that borrowers will elect to refinance their loans with other lenders 
to the extent economic conditions improve  the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance their loans increases 
non interest income and operating expenses 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by our travel  insurance and investment divisions  accretion income net of amortization related to the fdic assisted acquisitions  late charges and prepayment fees on loans  gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments and other general operating income 
in and  non interest income was also affected by the gains recognized on the fdic assisted transactions 
in and  increases in the cash flows expected to be collected from the fdic covered loan portfolios resulted in amortization expense recorded relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
non interest income may also be affected by the company s interest rate derivative activities  if the company chooses to implement derivatives 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  expenses related to foreclosed assets  postage  fdic deposit insurance  advertising and public relations  telephone  professional fees  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
details of the current period changes in non interest income and non interest expense are provided in the results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and section of this annual report on form k 
business initiatives as part of its long term strategic plan  the company anticipates opening two to three banking centers per year as conditions warrant 
in december  the company opened a new banking center in affton  mo  a suburb of st 
louis 
in addition  a new banking center in o fallon  mo  opened in february great southern travel moved its st 
peters office into the o fallon office as well 
the affton and o fallon facilities were former offices of other banks and provided expedient entries into these two st 
louis markets 
with the addition of these two locations  great southern operates seven banking centers in the st 
louis metro area 
construction is nearing completion on a new banking center on west kearney in north springfield that will replace a leased location approximately one block east of the site 
the current banking center s customer transaction volume is one of the highest in the company s franchise 
the banking center is expected to open in the second quarter of construction is well underway on a new banking center on west th street in olathe  kan  in an established retail business district 
this new banking center will replace the company s current banking center at south lone elm road  which is located in a lesser developed area of olathe 
great southern travel also expects to move its current olathe office to the new facility 
a second quarter opening is anticipated 
great southern insurance  a wholly owned subsidiary of great southern bank  moved in november from its former office at south avenue in springfield to an office complex on east battlefield in southeast springfield 
the new leased space offers better access for customers as the full service insurance agency looks to grow its retail and commercial insurance business 
in january  the company launched a new smartphone application for iphone and android users providing customers another channel for accessing their accounts 
effect of federal laws and regulations general 
federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
legislation impacting the financial services industry 
on july   sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things  will provide increased consumer financial protection  amend capital requirements for financial institutions  change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance  repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  amend the account balance limit for federal deposit insurance protection  and increase the authority of the federal reserve board 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company and the financial services industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments  and payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits 
provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the company and the bank could require the company and the bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future 
a provision of the dodd frank act  commonly referred to as the durbin amendment  directed the frb to analyze the debit card payments system and fix the interchange rates based upon their estimate of actual costs 
the frb has established the interchange rate for all debit transactions for issuers with over billion in assets  effective october   at per transaction 
an additional five basis points of the transaction amount and an additional may be collected by the issuer for fraud prevention and recovery  provided the issuer performs certain actions 
although the bank is currently exempt from the provisions of the rule on the basis of asset size  there is some uncertainty about the impact there will be on the interchange rates for issuers below the billion level of assets 
in december and january  the basel committee on banking supervision published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as basel iii 
although basel iii is intended to be implemented by participating countries for large  internationally active banks  its provisions are likely to be considered by united states banking regulators in developing new regulations applicable to other banks in the united states  including great southern 
for banks in the united states  among the provisions concerning capital are i a minimum ratio of common equity to risk weighted assets reaching  plus an additional as a capital conservation buffer  by after a phase in period  ii a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets reaching by after a phase in period  iii a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  plus the additional capital conservation buffer  reaching by after a phase in period  iv an additional countercyclical capital buffer to be imposed by applicable national banking regulators periodically at their discretion  with advance notice  and v restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses applicable when capital ratios fall within the buffer zone 
although basel iii is described as a final text  it is subject to the resolution of certain issues and to further guidance and modification  as well as to adoption by united states banking regulators  including decisions as to whether and to what extent it will apply to united states banks that are not large  internationally active banks 
fdic assisted acquisition of certain assets and liabilities on october   great southern bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement  including a loss sharing agreement  with the fdic to purchase substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the deposits and other liabilities of sun security bank  a full service bank headquartered in ellington  mo 
established in  sun security bank operated locations in counties in central and southern missouri 
only one market  stockton  mo  overlapped between the sun security bank and great southern footprints  with both institutions operating one branch in this market 
assets with a fair value of approximately million were acquired  including million of loans  million of investment securities  million of cash and cash equivalents  million of foreclosed assets  million of fhlb stock  and million of other assets 
liabilities with a fair value of million were assumed  including million of deposits  million of fhlb advances and  of other liabilities 
a customer related core deposit intangible asset of million was also recorded 
as a result of the excess of liabilities over assets  the bank received million in cash from the fdic 
the bank also expects to receive million from the fdic in the future due to adjustments identified by the fdic as part of their normal closing procedures 
under the loss sharing agreement  the fdic has agreed to cover of the losses on the loans excluding approximately million of consumer loans and foreclosed assets purchased subject to certain limitations 
the company recorded an fdic indemnification asset of million as a result of this loss sharing agreement 
the former sun security bank franchise is currently operating under the great southern name 
while the real estate  furniture and fixtures of the branch locations currently being operated were not included in the october  transaction  the bank has committed to purchase the majority of them from the fdic 
the exact cost of this purchase will be determined at a later date based on current appraisals  but the company expects the cost to be approximately million 
since the acquisition  banking center customer deposits have remained stable and the current retention rate is over 
the bank converted the sun security bank operational systems into great southern s systems on january   which allowed all great southern and former sun security bank customers to conduct business at any banking center throughout the great southern five state franchise 
the company recorded a preliminary one time gain of million pre tax based upon the initial estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations  during the year ended december  fasb asc allows a measurement period of up to one year to adjust initial fair value estimates as of the acquisition date 
the company will continue to evaluate the fair value estimates and  if necessary  they may be adjusted during the measurement period 
additional income will be recognized in future periods as loans are collected from customers and as reimbursements of losses are collected from the fdic  but we cannot estimate the timing of this income due to the variables associated with this transaction 
based on the level of discounts expected to be accreted into income in future years and the loss sharing agreement with the fdic  none of the acquired sun security bank loans are considered non performing  as we have a reasonable expectation to recover both the discounted book balances of such loans as well as a yield on the discounted book balances 
sun security bank presented an attractive franchise for the company to acquire because it provided immediate core deposit growth at a low cost of funds 
also attractive was the opportunity it presented for expansion into non overlapping yet complementary markets through banking centers which  for the most part  held strong market positions 
only one market  stockton  mo  overlapped between the sun security bank and great southern footprints  with both institutions operating one branch in this market 
the company also benefits from reduced credit risk due to the loss sharing agreement with the fdic that was part of the transaction

comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during the year ended december   total assets increased by million to billion 
the increase was primarily due to increases in loans and investment securities as well as the loans  investment securities and fdic indemnification asset that were acquired in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction 
the increase was also due to increases in prepaid expenses and other assets and premises and equipment  partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents 
net loans increased million to billion at december   due in part to the sun security bank loans acquired in the fdic assisted transaction which had a balance of million at december  commercial real estate loans increased million  or  commercial business loans increased million  or  and multi family residential loans increased million  or 
commercial construction loans also increased  but the increase was primarily offset by decreases in subdivision construction and land development loans 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in net loans acquired through the fdic assisted transactions of million  or  primarily because of loan repayments 
the net loan growth experienced during the year ended december   excluding the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction  may continue into the increase in loans during was primarily due to financing loans which had been previously financed by other lenders rather than overall economic improvement 
the company s strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels given the current credit and economic environments 
related to the loans purchased in the and fdic assisted transactions  the company recorded indemnification assets which represent payments expected to be received from the fdic through loss sharing agreements 
the total balance of the fdic indemnification asset increased million to million at december  the increase was due to the fdic indemnification asset recorded through the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction of million which was reduced million to million at december  due to amounts billed to the fdic for losses recognized 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease in the fdic indemnification assets related to the fdic assisted transactions due to actual payments received from the fdic as well as expected improved cash flows to be collected from the loan obligors  resulting in reductions in payments expected to be received from the fdic 
the expected improved cash flows are further discussed in the interest income loans section below 
securities available for sale increased million as compared to december  the increase was due in part to the acquisition of securities totaling million through the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction during the increase was also due to purchases of mortgage backed securities which increased million from million at december  to million at december  these securities were purchased for pledging to secure public fund deposits and customer reverse repurchase agreements and also to earn higher yields as compared to holding the funds in cash and cash equivalents 
while there is no specifically stated goal  the available for sale securities portfolio has in recent periods been approximately to of total assets 
the available for sale securities portfolio was and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
prepaid expenses and other assets increased million as compared to december   primarily due to a million increase in federal and state tax credit investments 
the majority of the increase in tax credit investments was due to investments in federal low income housing tax credits 
these credits are typically purchased at of the amount of the credit and are generally utilized to offset taxes payable over a year period 
for further information on the company s investments in tax credits  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
the company s net premises and equipment increased million as compared to december  this increase was due primarily to the expansion of the company s operations center and new locations added in response to the growth of the company and to provide for future growth 
during the year ended december   a building was purchased in springfield  mo 
to house the residential lending operation and a new banking center with larger facilities and better access was constructed to replace a leased banking center in springfield  mo 
at december   construction was near completion on a new banking center in olathe  kan 
that will relocate an existing banking center to a more established retail business district 
in addition  a new banking center in springfield  mo 
is under construction to relocate a banking center with one of the company s highest transaction volumes to provide more drive thru lanes and better access 
also contributing to the increase in net premises and equipment was a million upgrade of existing atms for compliance with recent regulations issued under the americans with disabilities act 
in future periods  when these upgrades are complete  depreciation expense is expected to increase 
during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million 
the decrease during was due to increased loan funding  purchases of available for sale securities and redemption of brokered deposits  partially offset by the cash received from the fdic in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction 
total liabilities increased million from billion at december  to billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in deposits and fhlbank advances  partially offset by decreases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with customers 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of the million of deposits assumed from sun security bank in the fdic assisted transaction during including the deposits assumed from sun security bank  interest bearing transaction accounts increased million  non interest bearing checking accounts increased million and retail certificates of deposit increased million 
since the second quarter of  the company s transaction account balances have trended upward while retail certificates of deposit have trended downward because of customer preference to have immediate access to funds during the current low interest rate environment 
however  the addition of the sun security deposits in the fourth quarter of resulted in the increase in retail certificates of deposit at december  total brokered deposits  excluding the cdars customer accounts  were million at december   down from million at december  the decrease was the result of million of brokered deposits that matured or were called by the company during the period while only million of new brokered deposits were added 
at december  and  great southern bank customer deposits totaling million and million  respectively  were part of the cdars program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the fdic deposit insurance limit 
the fdic counts these deposits as brokered  but these are deposit accounts that we generate with customers in our local markets 
fhlbank advances increased million from the december  level 
the increase was due to the addition of million of advances assumed in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction in primarily offset by the repayment of two advances totaling million during the year 
the level of fhlbank advances can fluctuate depending on growth in the company s loan portfolio and other funding needs and sources of funds available to the company 
most of the company s fhlbank advances are fixed rate advances that cannot be repaid prior to maturity without incurring significant penalties 
securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements with customers decreased million from december  as these balances fluctuate over time and rates paid on these accounts decreased 
total stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december  the company recorded net income of million for the year ended december   common and preferred dividends declared were million and accumulated other comprehensive income increased million 
the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from increases in the fair value of the company s available for sale investment securities 
in addition  total stockholders equity increased  due to stock option exercises 
on august   the company received an investment of million in its preferred stock from the united states department of the treasury treasury under the small business lending fund sblf 
simultaneously with the receipt of the sblf funds  the company redeemed the million of shares of preferred stock issued to the treasury in december under the capital purchase program cpp  a part of the troubled asset relief program 
the company also repurchased the common stock warrant representing  shares held by the treasury that was issued as a part of the company s participation in the cpp for a price of million  or per warrant share 
for further details of these transactions  see capital resources 
prior to our redemption of the cpp preferred stock  we were generally precluded from purchasing shares of the company s common stock without the treasury s consent 
our participation in the sblf program does not preclude us from purchasing shares of the company s common stock  provided that after giving effect to such purchase  i the dollar amount of the company s tier capital would be at least equal to the tier dividend threshold under the terms of the sblf preferred stock and ii full dividends on all outstanding shares of sblf preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period have been or are contemporaneously declared and paid 
see capital resources 
the company has historically utilized stock buy back programs from time to time as long as it believed that repurchasing the stock contributed to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the number of shares of stock repurchased and the price paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the market price of the stock 
results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and general net income increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million  or  and a decrease in provision for income taxes of million  or  partially offset by a decrease in non interest income of million  or  and an increase in non interest expense of million  or 
non interest income for the year ended december  included a gain recognized on business acquisition of million  and also included net amortization expense of the fdic indemnification asset of million 
net income available to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december total interest income total interest income increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million  or  increase in interest income on loans  while interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased  or 
interest income on loans increased primarily due to increases in expected cash flows to be received from the fdic acquired loan pools and the resulting adjustments to accretable yield as discussed below in interest income loans and in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
interest income from investment securities and other interest earning assets was not significantly different in compared to interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest income on loans increased due to higher average interest rates  partially offset by slightly lower average balances 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average interest rates on loans 
the average yield on loans increased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  this increase was due to additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions 
on an on going basis the company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools 
the cash flows estimate for the fdic assisted transactions had increased each quarter since the third quarter of  based on the payment histories and reduced loss expectations of the loan pools  resulting in a total of million of adjustments to be spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools 
the increases in expected cash flows also reduced the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
therefore  the expected indemnification assets for the fdic assisted transactions have also been reduced each quarter since the third quarter of  resulting in a total of million of adjustments to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreements or the remaining expected life of the loan pools  whichever is shorter 
the adjustments increased interest income by million and decreased non interest income by million during the year ended december   for a net impact of million to pre tax income 
because the adjustments will be recognized over the estimated remaining lives of the loan pools and the remainder of the loss sharing agreements  respectively  they will impact future periods as well 
the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets that will affect non interest income expense is million 
of the remaining adjustments  we expect to recognize million of interest income and million of non interest income expense in the next year 
additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods as the company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools 
for further discussion about these adjustments  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
apart from the yield accretion  the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december   as a result of both normal amortization of higher rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates 
interest income decreased  as a result of lower average loan balances which decreased from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the lower average balances were primarily due to decreases in outstanding construction loans as many projects were completed in the past to months and demand for new construction loans has declined 
partially offsetting the decreases in construction loans were increased average balances of commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans and other residential multi family loans 
interest income investments and other interest earning assets interest income on investments increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  average balances of securities increased due to purchases made for pledging to secure public fund deposits 
interest income on investments decreased million as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the majority of the company s securities in and were mortgage backed securities which are backed by hybrid arms that have fixed rates of interest for a period of time generally one to ten years and then adjust annually 
the actual amount of securities that reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities are subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
mortgage backed securities are also subject to reduced yields due to more rapid prepayments in the underlying mortgages 
as a result  premiums on these securities may be amortized against interest income more quickly  thereby reducing the yield recorded 
interest income on other interest earning assets changed little as slightly higher average rates were offset by lower average balances 
average balances of interest earning deposits decreased due to increased loan funding  purchases of available for sale securities and redemption of brokered deposits  partially offset by the cash received from the fdic in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction 
the company s interest earning deposits and non interest earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
total interest expense total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on short term and structured repo borrowings of  or  a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of  or and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or 
interest expense deposits interest on demand deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest since and because the company chose to pay lower rates during when compared to market rates of interest on checking and money market accounts have been decreasing since late when the frb began reducing short term interest rates 
interest on demand deposits increased million due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the increase in average balances of demand deposits was primarily a result of customer preference to transition from time deposits to demand deposits as well as organic growth in the company s deposit base  particularly in interest bearing checking accounts 
demand deposits assumed in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction during the fourth quarter of also contributed to the increase in average balances 
average noninterest bearing demand balances increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  interest expense on time deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  a large portion of the company s certificate of deposit portfolio matures within one year and so it reprices fairly quickly  this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years 
interest expense on deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  as previously mentioned  the decrease in average balances of time deposits was partly the result of customer preference to transition from time deposits to demand deposits 
also contributing to the decrease was the redemption of million of brokered deposits since while just million of new brokered deposits were added due to the company s existing liquidity levels 
time deposits assumed in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction during the fourth quarter of somewhat offset the decrease in average balances 
the dodd frank act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts beginning july  although the ultimate impact of this legislation on the company has not yet been determined  the company expects interest costs associated with demand deposits may increase as a result of competitor responses to this change  although no significant increases in costs have occurred through december  interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased due to lower average interest rates and lower average balances 
interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  most of the remaining advances are fixed rate and are subject to penalty if paid off prior to maturity 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements increased  due to an increase in average rates on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  the decrease in balances of short term borrowings was primarily due to decreases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with the company s deposit customers which tend to fluctuate 
interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased  due to a decrease in average rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  these debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at an average rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to in  an increase of basis points 
the company s margin was positively impacted primarily by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions and the resulting increases to accretable yield which was discussed previously in interest income loans and is discussed in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
the impact of these changes on the years ended december  and were increases in interest income of million and million  respectively  and increases in net interest margin of basis points and basis points  respectively 
excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion  net interest margin increased basis points during the year ended december   primarily due to a change in the deposit mix over the last year 
since december   lower cost checking accounts increased as customers added to existing accounts or new customer accounts were opened while higher cost brokered deposits decreased 
since december   the company redeemed million of brokered deposits due to the company s existing liquidity levels 
for most of  retail certificates of deposit continued to decrease  and those that were renewed or replaced generally had lower market rates of interest 
in the fourth quarter of  retail certificates of deposit increased due to the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction 
however  those assumed deposits generally paid lower rates of interest than existing retail certificates of deposit 
partially offsetting the decrease in rates on deposits was a decrease in yields on loans  excluding the yield accretion income discussed above  when compared to the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to an basis point increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets and a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s overall net interest margin increased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans increased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets increased four basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances decreased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings increased one basis point  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased three basis points

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses decreased  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in the year ended december   versus million in the year ended december  ten relationships made up million of the net charge off total for the year ended december  general market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs in both and as properties were categorized as potential problem loans  non performing loans or foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense 
management long ago established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio 
more recently  additional procedures have been implemented to provide for more frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size  loan type  delinquencies  on going correspondence with borrowers  and problem loan work outs 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss  and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
loans acquired in the march   september  and october   fdic assisted transactions are covered by loss sharing agreements between the fdic and great southern bank which afford great southern bank at least protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans 
the fdic loss sharing agreements are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered and are conditioned upon the bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the fdic 
these limitations are described in detail in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
the acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values  which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition dates 
these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition 
techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy great southern bank portfolio  with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics 
review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers  review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent 
at december  and  an allowance for loan losses was established for one loan pool exhibiting risks of loss totaling  the loan pool was acquired through the vantus bank fdic assisted transaction and because of the loss sharing agreement  only of the anticipated  loss would be ultimately borne by the bank 
at december   an allowance for loan losses was established for one other loan pool exhibiting risks of loss estimated at  this loan pool was charged off during at an amount of  which was the remaining balance of the loan pool  of which  was covered by the loss sharing agreement 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  excluding loans supported by the fdic loss sharing agreements  was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at december   based on recent reviews of the company s loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
if economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate further  it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets former teambank  vantus bank and sun security bank non performing assets  including foreclosed assets  are not included in the totals and in the discussion of non performing loans  potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below due to the respective loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which cover at least of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios 
in addition  these covered assets were recorded at their estimated fair values as of march   for teambank  september   for vantus bank and october   for sun security bank 
the overall performance of the teambank and vantus bank fdic covered loan pools has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates 
because of the recent acquisition date for the sun security bank fdic covered loan pools  initial performance expectations have not materially changed 
as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate 
non performing assets  excluding fdic covered assets  at december  were million  a decrease of million from million at december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   compared to at december  compared to december   non performing loans decreased million to million and foreclosed assets decreased million to million 
construction and land development loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  commercial real estate loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  non performing loans 
activity in the non performing loans category during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions removed from non performing transfers to potential problem loans transfers to foreclosed assets charge offs payments ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate other commercial consumer total at december   the subdivision construction category of non performing loans included loans 
the largest relationship in this category  which was added during the year  totaled million  or of the total category  and was collateralized by property in central arkansas 
the one to four family residential category included loans  of which were added during the year 
none of the loans added to the one to four family residential category during were included in borrower relationships that were larger than  the commercial real estate category included nine loans  five of which were added during the year 
the largest relationship in this category  which was added during the year  totaled million  or of the total category  and was collateralized by property in springfield  mo 
foreclosed assets 
of the total million of foreclosed assets at december   million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets acquired in the fdic assisted transactions in and these acquired foreclosed assets are subject to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic and  therefore  are not included in the following table and discussion of foreclosed assets 
activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions proceeds from sales capitalized costs ore expense write downs ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate commercial business consumer total at december   the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included properties  the largest of which was located in the st 
louis  mo 
metropolitan area and had a balance of million  or of the total category 
of the total dollar amount in the subdivision construction category  is located in branson  mo 
the land development category of foreclosed assets included properties  the largest of which had a balance of million  or of the total category 
of the total dollar amount in the land development category  was located in northwest arkansas  including the largest property previously mentioned 
as discussed below in the non interest expense section  the million in write downs of foreclosed assets was primarily the result of management s evaluation of the foreclosed assets portfolio and decision to more aggressively market certain properties by reducing the asking prices 
management obtained broker pricing or used recent appraisals that were discounted based on internal experience selling or attempting to sell similar properties to determine the new asking prices 
the majority of these write downs were made in the subdivision construction and land development categories where properties are more speculative in nature and market activity has been very slow 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans decreased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets  but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions removed from potential problem transfers to non performing transfers to foreclosed assets charge offs payments ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate other commercial consumer total at december   the commercial real estate category of potential problem loans included loans 
the largest two relationships in this category  which were added during the year  had balances of million and million  respectively  or of the total category 
both relationships were collateralized by properties in southwest missouri 
the one to four family residential category included loans  of which were added during the year 
the largest relationship in this category  which was added during the year and included six loans  totaled million  or of the total category  and was collateralized by over separate properties in southwest missouri 
another relationship in this category  which was added during the year and included loans  totaled million  or of the total category  and was collateralized by over separate properties in southwest missouri 
the other residential category included four loans  three of which were added during the year 
the largest two relationships in this category  which were added during the year  had balances of million and million  respectively  or of the total category 
the relationships were collateralized by apartment buildings in southwest missouri and central missouri  respectively 
non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  was primarily the result of the following items amortization of indemnification asset as previously described under net interest income  due to the increase in cash flows expected to be collected from the teambank and vantus bank fdic covered loan portfolios  million of amortization expense was recorded in the year ended december  relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
this amortization expense amount was up million from the million that was recorded in the year ended december  relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
gains on securities fewer securities were sold during the year ended december   and  therefore  gains recognized on sales were  down million from million recognized for the year ended december  securities impairments during the year ended december   losses totaling  were recorded as a result of impairment write downs in the value of an investment in a non agency cmo 
the company continues to hold this security in the available for sale category 
based on analyses of the securities portfolio during  no impairment write downs were necessary 
partially offsetting the above decreases in non interest income was the preliminary one time gain of million pre tax recorded in relation to the sun security bank fdic assisted acquisition during the year ended december   compared to the same period in non interest expense total non interest expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the company s efficiency ratio for the year ended december   was  up from in due to increased non interest expenses as described below 
the company s ratio of non interest expense to average assets increased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the following were key items related to the increase in non interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  sun security bank fdic assisted transaction non interest expense increased million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   due to the fdic assisted acquisition of the former sun security bank on october  of this amount  million related to non recurring acquisition related expenses  primarily related to salaries and benefits  and occupancy and equipment expenses 
salaries and benefits as a result of integrating the operations of sun security bank and the company s overall growth  the number of associates employed by the company in operational and lending areas increased from december  to december  this personnel increase  which excludes associates added from the former sun security bank  as well as general merit increases for existing associates  was responsible for million of the increase in salaries and benefits paid during the year ended december  when compared with the year ended december  amortization of tax credits the company has invested in certain federal low income housing tax credits and federal new market tax credits 
these credits are typically purchased at of the amount of the credit and are generally utilized to offset taxes payable over ten year and seven year periods  respectively 
during the year ended december   tax credits used to reduce the company s tax expense totaled million  up million from million for the year ended december  these tax credits resulted in corresponding amortization of million during the year ended december   up million from million for the year ended december  the net result of these transactions was an increase to non interest expense and a decrease to income tax expense  which positively impacted the company s effective tax rate  but negatively impacted the company s non interest expense and efficiency ratio 
foreclosure related expenses since the economic recession began in  real estate markets have not experienced full recovery and the company has had continued higher levels of foreclosed assets 
sales of certain types of foreclosed properties have been slow and as a result  the most recent asking prices for certain properties  which were based on estimated fair values  no longer reflected reasonable selling prices 
during the year ended december   the asking prices and recorded values for most properties in foreclosed assets  excluding those covered by fdic loss sharing agreements  were reviewed and  in some cases  management and the board of directors decided to take a more aggressive approach to market some of these properties 
in the instances where the asking prices were reduced  the carrying values of the assets were adjusted down to reflect the new estimated selling prices 
in reviewing the values of the properties  the company either used broker pricing or obtained new appraisals and discounted them based on our internal experience with similar properties 
the result of this review was a million write down in the carrying value of foreclosed assets during the year ended december   primarily resulting in a million increase in foreclosure related expenses over the year ended december  prior to the write downs  the book values of the properties totaled million 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates as compared to the statutory federal tax rate of were primarily affected by the tax credits noted above and by higher balances and rates of tax exempt investment securities and loans which reduce the company s effective tax rate 
for future periods  the company expects the effective tax rate to be approximately of pre tax net income due to expected continued utilization of tax credits 
the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of its utilization of tax credits and the level of tax exempt investments and loans

non interest income for the year ended december  included gains recognized on business acquisitions of million 
net income available to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total interest income total interest income increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was due to a million  or  increase in interest income on loans  offset in part by a million  or  decrease in interest income on investments and other interest earning assets 
interest income on loans increased primarily due to increases in expected cash flows to be received from the fdic acquired loan pools and the resulting adjustments to accretable yield as discussed below in interest income loans and in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
interest income from investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased due to lower average rates of interest  partially offset by higher average balances 
the lower average investment yields were primarily a result of lower yields on mortgage backed securities as interest rates reset downward 
prepayments on the mortgages underlying these securities resulted in amortization of premiums which also reduced yields 
an increase in the amount of sba loan pools held  which earn lower average rates than the overall securities portfolio  contributed to lower investment yields as well 
sba loan pools are held for their variable interest rate characteristics and guarantee by the federal government  which makes them relatively low risk investments 
interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest income on loans increased due to higher average interest rates  partially offset by slightly lower average balances 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average interest rates on loans 
the average yield on loans increased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  this increase was due to additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions 
on an on going basis the company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools 
this cash flows estimate increased during the third and fourth quarters of based on the payment histories and reduced loss expectations of the loan pools  resulting in a total of million of adjustments to be spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools 
the increases in expected cash flows also reduced the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
therefore  the expected indemnification assets were also reduced during the third and fourth quarters of resulting in a total of million of adjustments to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreements or the remaining expected life of the loan pools  whichever is shorter 
the adjustments increased interest income by million and decreased non interest income by million during the year ended december   for a net impact of million to pre tax income 
because the adjustments will be recognized over the estimated remaining lives of the loan pools and the remainder of the loss sharing agreements  respectively  they will impact future periods as well 
the majority of the remaining million of accretable yield adjustment affecting interest income and million of adjustment to the indemnification assets affecting non interest income is expected to be recognized over the next year  with million of interest income and million of non interest income expense expected to be recognized in the next year 
for further discussion about these adjustments  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
apart from the yield accretion discussed above  average loan rates were very similar in compared to  as a result of market rates of interest  primarily the prime rate of interest  remaining flat during this period 
during  the prime rate decreased to a rate of at december   where the prime rate has remained 
a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
the company has a portfolio of prime based loans which have interest rate floors 
beginning in  the declining interest rates put these loan rate floors in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
great southern has a significant portfolio of loans which are tied to a prime rate of interest 
some of these loans are tied to some national index of prime  while most are indexed to great southern prime 
the company has elected to leave its prime rate of interest at in light of the current highly competitive funding environment for deposits and wholesale funds 
this does not affect a large number of customers  as a majority of the loans indexed to great southern prime are already at interest rate floors  which are provided for in individual loan documents 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of a positive basis points 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of a positive basis points 
interest income decreased  as a result of lower average loan balances which decreased from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the lower average balance resulted primarily from decreases in outstanding construction loans as many projects were completed in the past to months and demand for new construction loans has declined 
interest income investments and other interest earning assets interest income on investments and other interest earning assets decreased as a result of lower average interest rates during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income decreased million as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the majority of the company s securities in and were mortgage backed securities which are backed by hybrid arms that have fixed rates of interest for a period of time generally one to ten years and then adjust annually 
the actual amount of securities that reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities are subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
mortgage backed securities are also subject to reduced yields due to more rapid prepayments in the underlying mortgages 
as a result  premiums on these securities may be amortized against interest income more quickly  thereby reducing the yield recorded 
an increase in sba loan pools during also contributed to the decrease in average interest rates because these securities earn lower yields than the overall securities portfolio 
interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in interest earning deposits as a result of the fdic assisted transactions and because of net loan repayments and lower overall loan demand 
available for sale sba loan pools also contributed to the increase  where securities were needed for liquidity and pledging against deposit accounts under customer repurchase agreements 
in and  the company had increased interest earning deposits and non interest earning cash equivalents  as additional liquidity was maintained due to uncertainty in the economy and low loan demand 
these deposits and cash equivalents earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  total interest expense total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on short term and structured repo borrowings of million  or  and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or  partially offset by an increase in interest expense on fhlbank advances of  or 
interest expense deposits interest on demand deposits increased million due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the increase in average balances of demand deposits was primarily a result of the fdic assisted transactions completed in  as well as organic growth in the company s deposit base  particularly in interest bearing checking accounts 
also contributing to the increase was the transition in the company s overall deposit mix from time deposits to demand deposits during the end of and throughout average noninterest bearing demand balances increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  interest on demand deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest throughout and market rates of interest on checking and money market accounts have been decreasing since late when the frb began reducing short term interest rates 
interest expense on time deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  a large portion of the company s certificate of deposit portfolio matures within one year and so it reprices fairly quickly  this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years 
interest expense on deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the decrease in average balances of time deposits was primarily a result of decreases in brokered certificates  cdars customer deposits and cdars purchased funds as the company began redeeming them or replacing them with lower rate deposits in the latter quarters of in  in some cases  the company elected not to replace these funds as they matured due to growth in lower cost demand deposits 
included in the brokered deposits total at december   was million which is part of cdars 
this total includes million in cdars customer deposit accounts and million in cdars purchased funds 
included in the brokered deposits total at december   was million which was part of cdars 
this total includes million in cdars customer deposit accounts and million in cdars purchased funds 
cdars customer deposit accounts are accounts that are just like any other deposit account on the company s books  except that the account total exceeds the fdic deposit insurance maximum 
when a customer places a large deposit with a cdars network bank  that bank uses cdars to place the funds into deposit accounts issued by other banks in the cdars network 
this occurs in increments of less than the standard fdic insurance maximum  so that both principal and interest are eligible for complete fdic protection 
other network members do the same thing with their customers funds 
interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest expense on fhlbank advances increased due to higher average interest rates  partially offset by lower average balances 
interest expense on fhlbank advances increased million due to an increase in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  average rates on advances increased because of the addition of advances assumed in the fdic assisted transaction completed in march of certain of the advances assumed were paid off toward the end of  causing the decrease in average balances while most of the remaining advances are fixed rate and are subject to penalty if paid off prior to maturity 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements decreased million due to a decrease in average rates on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest in compared to interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the decrease in balances of short term borrowings was primarily due to decreases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with the company s deposit customers which tend to fluctuate 
interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased  due to decreases in average rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  as libor rates decreased from the prior year  the interest rates on these instruments also adjusted lower 
the average rate of interest on these subordinated debentures decreased in as these liabilities pay a variable rate of interest that is indexed to libor 
these debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at an average rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to in  an increase of basis points 
the company s margin was positively impacted primarily by the increase in expected cash flows to be received from the fdic acquired loan pools and the resulting increase to accretable yield which was discussed previously in interest income loans and is discussed in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
the impact of this change on the year ended december  was an increase in interest income of million and an increase in net interest margin of basis points 
also contributing to the increase in net interest income was a change in the deposit mix and the ability to reduce interest rates on maturing time deposits 
the addition of the teambank and vantus bank core deposits during provided a relatively lower cost funding source  which allowed the company to reduce some of its higher cost funds 
in the latter quarters of  the company redeemed brokered deposits or replaced them with lower rate deposits and as retail certificates of deposit matured they were renewed or replaced with retail certificates of deposit with lower market rates of interest 
the transition from time deposits to transaction deposits continued into as lower cost checking accounts increased while the company reduced its higher cost cdars accounts 
the company has reduced rates paid on repurchase agreements which also contributed to the decrease in interest expense 
partially offsetting the reduced cost of funds  yields earned on investment securities are down over the last year because the majority of the company s portfolio is made up of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities which both repriced downward and experienced higher prepayments resulting in increased amortization of related premiums that offset interest earned 
excluding the income recorded from the accretable yield adjustment mentioned above  the yield on loans increased basis points during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increased average balances on residential and commercial real estate loans 
the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin increased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans increased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances increased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings decreased basis points  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased basis points

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in the year ended december   versus million in the year ended december  eight relationships made up million of the net charge off total for the year ended december  general market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs in both and as properties were categorized as potential problem loans  non performing loans or foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense 
management long ago established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio 
more recently  additional procedures have been implemented to provide for more frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size  loan type  delinquencies  on going correspondence with borrowers  and problem loan work outs 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss  and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
loans acquired in the march  and september   fdic assisted transactions are covered by loss sharing agreements between the fdic and great southern bank which afford great southern bank significant protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans 
the acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values  which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition dates 
these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition 
techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to the legacy great southern bank portfolio  with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics 
review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers  review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent 
at december   allowances for loan losses were established for two loan pools exhibiting risks of loss totaling  these loan pools were acquired through the vantus bank fdic assisted transaction and because of the loss sharing agreement  only of the anticipated  loss would be ultimately borne by the bank 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  excluding loans supported by the fdic loss sharing agreements  was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at december   based on recent reviews of the company s loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
if economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets former teambank and vantus bank non performing assets  including foreclosed assets  are not included in the totals and in the discussion of non performing loans  potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below due to the respective loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which substantially cover principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios 
in addition  these covered assets were recorded at their estimated fair values as of march   for teambank and september   for vantus bank 
as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate 
non performing assets at december  were million  an increase of million from december  non performing assets  excluding fdic covered assets  as a percentage of total assets were at december   compared to at december  compared to december   non performing loans increased million to million at december   while foreclosed assets increased million to million at december  construction loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  commercial real estate loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  non performing loans

the largest two loans in this category were added during the year and were million and million  respectively  making up of the total 
the land development category of non performing loans included loans  the largest of which had a balance of million or of the total 
foreclosed assets 
of the total million of foreclosed assets at december   million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets acquired in the fdic assisted transactions in these acquired foreclosed assets are subject to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic and  therefore  are not included in the following table and discussion of foreclosed assets 
activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions proceeds from sales capitalized costs ore expense write downs ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate consumer total the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included properties  the largest of which had a balance of million or of the total at december  the land development category of foreclosed assets included loans  the largest of which was added during the period and had a balance of million or 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans increased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets  but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions removed from potential problem transfers to non performing transfers to foreclosed assets charge offs payments ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate other commercial consumer total at december   the commercial real estate category of potential problem loans included loans  three of which were added during the year  with balances totaling million or of the total 
the three loans added were collateralized by a retail apartment building in st 
louis  mo  a hotel in kansas city  mo 
and a warehouse office building in springfield  mo 
the land development category of potential problem loans included loans  the largest of which was added during the year and had a balance of million or of the total 
non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily the result of the following items fdic assisted transactions a total of million of one time pre tax gains was recorded during related to the fair value accounting estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the fdic assisted transactions involving teambank and vantus bank 
amortization of indemnification asset as previously described  due to the increase in cash flows expected to be collected from the fdic covered loan portfolios acquired in  million of amortization expense was recorded in the period relating to a reduction of expected reimbursements under the fdic loss sharing agreements  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
partially offsetting the above decreases in non interest income for as compared with were the following items securities impairments during  a million loss was recorded as a result of an impairment write down in the value of certain available for sale equity investments  investments in bank trust preferred securities and an investment in a non agency cmo 
the company continues to hold a majority of these securities in the available for sale category 
based on analyses of the securities portfolio during  no additional impairment write downs were necessary 
gains on securities gains of million were recorded during due to sales of securities  an increase of million over service charges and atm fees an increase of  was recorded during compared to  primarily due to customers added in the fdic assisted transactions in gains on sales of single family loans an increase of  in gains was recorded due to an increased number of fixed rate loans originated and then sold in the secondary market during compared to commissions commission income increased million during the year ended december   compared to  primarily due to increased activity for great southern travel 
approximately of the increase was a non recurring incentive commission related to airline ticket sales 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the company s efficiency ratio for the year ended december   was compared to in the difference in the ratios from the current year to the prior year was primarily due to the teambank and vantus bank related one time gains recorded in the company s ratio of non interest expense to average assets increased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the following were key items related to the increase in non interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  vantus bank fdic assisted transaction the company s increase in non interest expense in compared to included expenses related to the september fdic assisted acquisition of the assets and liabilities of vantus bank and its ongoing operation 
in the year ended december   non interest expense associated with vantus bank increased million from the same period in the largest expense increases were in the areas of salaries and benefits and occupancy and equipment expenses 
in addition  other non interest expenses related to the operation of other areas of the former vantus bank  such as lending and certain support functions  were absorbed in other pre existing areas of the company  resulting in increased non interest expense 
new banking centers the company s increase in non interest expense during compared to was also related to the continued internal growth of the company 
the company opened its second banking center in lee s summit  mo  in late september and its first retail banking center in rogers  ark  in may new banking centers were also opened in des peres  mo 
in september and in forsyth  mo 
in december  both of which complement existing banking centers in their respective market areas 
in the year ended december   non interest expenses associated with the operation of these locations increased  over the same period in for additional information on the company s growth  see the business initiatives section of this report 
salaries and benefits as a result of integrating the operations of teambank and vantus bank and the administration of the loss sharing portfolios as well as overall growth  the number of associates employed by the company in operational and lending areas increased over this in turn increased salaries and benefits paid by million in compared to amortization of low income housing tax credits the company has invested in certain federal low income housing tax credits 
these credits are typically purchased at of the amount of the credit and are generally utilized to offset taxes payable over a ten year period 
a portion of these credits totaling million were used in to reduce the company s tax expense which resulted in corresponding amortization of million to reduce the investment in these credits 
the net result of these transactions was an increase to non interest expense and a decrease to income tax expense  which positively impacted the company s effective tax rate 
fdic settlements for real estate  furniture and fixtures during the three months ended december   the company completed its final settlements with the fdic for the purchase of the real estate  furniture and fixtures of the branch locations currently being operated as a result of the fdic assisted transactions which took place during the net settlement expenses recorded as a result of these and other outstanding operating items were  net occupancy expense as the company s operations expanded in the last year  so did the costs incurred to use and maintain buildings and equipment

the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of its utilization of tax credits 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
these obligations include the credit needs of customers  funding deposit withdrawals and the day to day operations of the company 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans 
as a result of the company s management of the ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs

during the year ended december   investing activities provided cash of million  primarily due to the cash received from the fdic assisted acquisitions and the repayment of loans 
changes in cash flows from financing activities during the periods covered by the statements of cash flows are due to changes in deposits after interest credited  changes in fhlbank advances  changes in short term borrowings  and dividend payments to stockholders 
in  the change in cash flows from financing activities was also impacted by the issuance of preferred stock through the company s participation in the sblf program as well as the redemption of preferred stock and the repurchase of common stock warrants which were both issued in conjunction with the company s participation in the cpp 
financing activities used cash flows of million for the year ended december   primarily due to reductions of brokered deposit balances and reductions in customer repurchase agreements primarily offset by increases in transaction deposits

on december   the company completed a transaction to participate in the treasury s voluntary capital purchase program cpp 
the cpp  a part of the emergency economic stabilization act of  was designed to provide capital to healthy financial institutions  thereby increasing confidence in the banking industry and increasing the flow of financing to businesses and consumers 
at the time the company was approved to participate in the cpp in december  it exceeded all well capitalized regulatory benchmarks and  as indicated above  it continues to exceed these benchmarks 
the company received million from the treasury through the sale of  shares of the company s newly authorized fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a the cpp preferred stock 
the company also issued to the us treasury a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the amount of preferred shares sold represented approximately of the company s risk weighted assets at september  on august   the company entered into a small business lending fund securities purchase agreement purchase agreement with the secretary of the treasury  pursuant to which the company sold  shares of the company s senior non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a the sblf preferred stock to the secretary of the treasury for a purchase price of  the sblf preferred stock was issued pursuant to treasury s sblf program  a billion fund established under the small business jobs act of that was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing tier capital to qualified community banks and holding companies with assets of less than billion 
as required by the purchase agreement  the proceeds from the sale of the sblf preferred stock were used to redeem the  shares of cpp preferred stock  issued to the treasury pursuant to the cpp  at a redemption price of million plus the accrued dividends owed on the preferred shares 
the sblf preferred stock qualifies as tier capital 
the sblf preferred stock is entitled to receive non cumulative dividends  payable quarterly  on each january  april  july and october  beginning october  the dividend rate  as a percentage of the liquidation amount  can fluctuate on a quarterly basis during the first quarters during which the sblf preferred stock is outstanding  based upon changes in the level of qualified small business lending or qsbl as defined in the purchase agreement by the bank over the adjusted baseline level calculated under the terms of the sblf preferred stock 
the initial dividend rate through september   was and the dividend rate for the fourth quarter of was 
based upon the increase in the bank s level of qsbl over the baseline level  the dividend rate for the first and second quarters of is expected to be approximately 
for the third through ninth calendar quarters after the closing  the dividend rate may be adjusted to between one percent and five percent per annum based on the level of qualifying loans 
for the tenth calendar quarter through four and one half years after issuance  the dividend rate will be fixed at between one percent and seven percent based upon the level of qualifying loans 
after four and one half years from issuance  the dividend rate will increase to including a quarterly lending incentive fee of 
the sblf preferred stock is non voting  except in limited circumstances 
in the event that the company misses five dividend payments  whether or not consecutive  the holder of the sblf preferred stock will have the right  but not the obligation  to appoint a representative as an observer on the company s board of directors 
in the event that the company misses six dividend payments  whether or not consecutive  and if the then outstanding aggregate liquidation amount of the sblf preferred stock is at least  then the holder of the sblf preferred stock will have the right to designate two directors to the board of directors of the company 
the sblf preferred stock may be redeemed at any time at the company s option  at a redemption price of of the liquidation amount plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the date of redemption for the current period  subject to the approval of its federal banking regulator 
on september   the company completed the repurchase of the warrant held by the treasury that was issued as a part of its participation in the cpp 
the year warrant was issued on december  and entitled the treasury to purchase  shares of great southern bancorp  inc common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the repurchase was completed for a price of million  or per warrant share  which was based on the fair market value of the warrant as agreed upon by the company and the treasury 
dividends 
during the year ended december   the company declared and paid common stock cash dividends of per share of net income per common share 
during the year ended december   the company declared and paid common stock cash dividends of per share of net income per common share 
the board of directors meets regularly to consider the level and the timing of dividend payments 
the dividend declared but unpaid as of december   was paid to stockholders on january  in addition  the company paid preferred dividends as described below 
as a result of the issuance of preferred stock to the treasury pursuant to the cpp in december  during the year ended december   the company paid preferred stock cash dividends of  on each of february   may  and august  in addition  previously accrued but unpaid preferred stock cash dividends of  were paid on august  in conjunction with the redemption of the cpp preferred stock on the same date 
during the year ended december   the company paid preferred stock cash dividends of  on each of february   may   august   and november  the redemption of the cpp preferred stock resulted in a non cash deemed preferred stock dividend that reduced net income available to common shareholders in the year ended december  by million 
this amount represents the difference between the repurchase price and the carrying amount of the cpp preferred stock  or the accelerated accretion of the applicable discount on the cpp preferred stock 
the terms of the sblf preferred stock impose limits on the ability of the company to pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock 
under the terms of the sblf preferred stock  no repurchases may be effected  and no dividends may be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the sblf preferred stock  junior preferred shares  or other junior securities including the common stock during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the sblf preferred stock  except that  in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid  dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach 
under the terms of the sblf preferred stock  the company may only declare and pay a dividend on the common stock or other stock junior to the sblf preferred stock  or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock  if  after payment of such dividend  or after giving effect to such repurchase  i the dollar amount of the company s tier capital would be at least equal to the tier dividend threshold and ii full dividends on all outstanding shares of sblf preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period have been or are contemporaneously declared and paid 
as of december   we satisfied this condition 
the tier dividend threshold means of  which was the company s consolidated tier capital as of june   less the million in tarp preferred stock then outstanding and repaid on august   plus the  in sblf preferred stock issued and minus the net loan charge offs by the bank since august  the tier dividend threshold is subject to reduction  beginning on the first day of the eleventh dividend period following the date of issuance of the sblf preferred stock  by  ten percent of the aggregate liquidation amount of the sblf preferred stock initially issued  without regard to any subsequent partial redemptions for each one percent increase in qualified small business lending from the adjusted baseline level under the terms of the sblf preferred stock ie   to the ninth dividend period 
common stock repurchases and issuances 
the company has been in various buy back programs since may our ability to repurchase common stock is currently restricted under the terms of the sblf preferred stock as noted above  under dividends and was previously precluded due to our participation in the cpp beginning in december therefore  during the years ended december  and  the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock 
during the years ended december  and  the company issued  shares of stock at an average price of per share and  shares of stock at an average price of per share  respectively  to cover stock option exercises 
management has historically utilized stock buy back programs from time to time as long as repurchasing the stock contributed to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the number of shares of stock repurchased and the price paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is neutral to slightly negative 
generally  a rate increase by the frb which does not appear likely in the very near term based on current economic conditions and recent comments by frb officials would be expected to have an immediate negative impact on great southern s net interest income 
as the federal funds rate is now very low  the company s interest rate floors have been reached on most of its prime rate loans 
in addition  great southern has elected to leave its great southern prime rate at for those loans that are indexed to great southern prime rather than wall street journal prime 
while these interest rate floors and prime rate adjustments have helped keep the rate on our loan portfolio higher in this very low interest rate environment  they will also reduce the positive effect to our loan rates when market interest rates  specifically the prime rate  begin to increase 
the interest rate on these loans will not increase until the loan floors are reached and the wall street journal prime interest rate exceeds 
if rates remain generally unchanged in the short term  we expect that our cost of funds will continue to decrease somewhat as we continue to redeem some of our wholesale funds 
in addition  a significant portion of our retail certificates of deposit mature in the next few months and we expect that they will be replaced with new certificates of deposit at somewhat lower interest rates 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
in the normal course of business  the company may use derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps from time to time to assist in its interest rate risk management 
prior to december   the company used interest rate swap derivatives  primarily as an asset liability management strategy  in order to hedge against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit caused by changes in market interest rates 
the swap agreements generally provided for the company to pay a variable rate of interest based on a spread to the one month or three month london interbank offering rate libor and to receive a fixed rate of interest equal to that of the hedged instrument 
under the swap agreements the company paid or received interest monthly  quarterly  semiannually or at maturity 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began executing interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies 
those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the company executes with a third party  such that the company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions 
because the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements  changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings 
these interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and  therefore  are not used to manage interest rate risk in the company s assets or liabilities 
the company manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions
