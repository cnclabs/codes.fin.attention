overview through skywest airlines and expressjet  we operate the largest regional airline in the united states 
as of december   skywest airlines and expressjet offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately  total daily departures to destinations in the united states  canada  mexico and the caribbean 
as of december   we operated a combined fleet of aircraft consisting of the following crj erj crj crj emb total delta united continental alaska us airways maintenance spare subleased to an un affiliated entity subleased to an affiliated entity total for the year ended december   approximately of our aggregate capacity was operated under the united express agreements and the continental express agreement  approximately was operated under the delta connection agreements  approximately was operated under the alaska capacity purchase agreement  approximately was operated under the us airways code share agreement and approximately was operated under a code share agreement with airtran 
skywest airlines has been a code share partner with delta in salt lake city and united in los angeles since and  respectively 
in  skywest airlines expanded its relationship with united to provide service in portland  seattle tacoma  san francisco and additional los angeles markets 
in  skywest airlines expanded its united express operations to provide service in chicago 
in may  skywest airlines entered into a capacity purchase agreement with alaska 
in addition  during november skywest airlines entered into a code share agreement with us airways 
as of december   skywest airlines operated as a delta connection carrier in salt lake city and minneapolis  a united express carrier in los angeles  san francisco  denver  houston  chicago and the pacific northwest  an alaska carrier in seattle tacoma and portland and a us airways carrier in phoenix 
on november   atlantic southeast and expressjet delaware consolidated their operations under a single operating certificate  and on december   atlantic southeast and expressjet delaware completed the expressjet combination 
at the time of the expressjet combination  atlantic southeast had been a code share partner with delta in atlanta since and united since 
table of contents february upon the completion of the expressjet combination on december   expressjet operated as a delta connection carrier in atlanta and cincinnati and a united express carrier in chicago o hare  washington  dc dulles international airport  cleveland  newark and houston 
historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled us to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of contract flying and our controlled or pro rate flying 
for the year ended december   contract flying revenue and pro rate revenue represented approximately and  respectively  of our total passenger revenues 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on the completed block hours  flight departures and other operating measures 
on pro rate flights  we control scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receive a pro rated portion of passenger fares 
for the year ended december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements  while approximately the asms flown by our brasilia turboprops in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining of the asms flown by our brasilias in the united system were flown under pro rate arrangements 
for the year ended december   approximately of the asms flown by our crjs in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining of the asms flown under pro rate arrangements 
financial highlights we had revenues of billion for the year ended december   a increase  compared to revenues of billion for the year ended december  we had a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   a decrease of  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the significant items affecting our financial performance during the year ended december  are summarized below on november   we completed the expressjet merger  which has substantially affected all aspects of our operations 
among other effects  the expressjet merger added erj aircraft to our fleet 
the completion of the expressjet merger is the most significant factor that affects the comparability of our financial and operating results between the year ended december  and the year ended december  the delta connection agreements provide that  beginning with the fifth anniversary of the execution of the agreements september   delta has the right to require that certain contractual rates under those agreements shall not exceed the second lowest rates of all carriers within the delta connection program 
during the fourth quarter of  skywest airlines and atlantic southeast now expressjet reached an agreement with delta on contractual rates satisfying the second lowest rate provision and agreed on rates through december  delta additionally waived its right to require that the contractual rates payable under the delta connection agreements under those agreements shall not exceed the second lowest of all carriers within the delta connection program through december  as a result of the negotiated adjustment of the contractual rates under the delta connection agreements  our passenger revenues for the year ended december  were million lower than they would have been under the rates that existed prior to the adjustment 
we recorded million in additional revenue as a result of the finalization of contractual rates during the quarter ended december  under the terms of the skywest airlines and expressjet delta connection agreements  delta has agreed to compensate skywest airlines and expressjet for initiatives that directly result in pass through cost savings 
delta agreed to share such savings with skywest airlines and expressjet on an equal basis for a twelve month period 
during the three months 
table of contents ended december   delta paid  and skywest airlines and atlantic southeast recognized  approximately million in cost savings revenue 
we did not receive similar payments during the year ended december  during the year ended december   under our skywest airlines and expressjet united express agreements we incurred million of crj engine maintenance expense  compared to million during the year ended december  we anticipate that the number of scheduled engine maintenance events we experienced during each quarter of the year ended december  will likely continue through the middle of  after which we expect a reduction in the number of scheduled engine maintenance events 
other expense  net  increased million  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was due  in large part  to our recognition of the portion of the losses incurred by trip and air mekong under the equity method of accounting 
under our expressjet delta connection agreement and our skywest airlines and expressjet united express agreements  we are paid incentive compensation upon the achievement of certain performance criteria 
our passenger revenues for the year ended december  were million lower than our passenger revenues for the year ended december   due primarily to our receipt of lower incentive payments from delta and united under those agreements based on our performance relative to the targets 
in connection with the preparation of our tax return  our management identified an adjustment to the expressjet acquisition accounting that resulted in an increase to the acquired deferred tax liabilities of million 
the adjustment is reflected on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  under the caption purchase accounting gain adjustment 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  stock based compensation expense and fair value as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ  and could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
our agreements with our code share partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
in the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we record that period s revenues based on the lower of the prior period s approved rates adjusted for the current contract negotiations and our estimate of rates that will be implemented 
also  in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major partner at a quarterly or annual financial 
table of contents statement date  we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and  provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute 
accordingly  we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
maintenance we use the direct expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs 
under this method  the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed 
we use the deferral method of accounting for our brasilia turboprop engine overhauls  which provides for engine overhaul costs to be capitalized and depreciated to the next estimated overhaul event or to the remaining useful life  whichever is shorter 
for leased aircraft  we are subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
with respect to engine overhauls related to leased brasilia turboprops to be returned  we adjust the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
with respect to skywest airlines  a third party vendor provides our long term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on our crjs operated under the skywest airlines united express agreement 
under the terms of the vendor agreement  we pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the third party vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 
thus  under the third party vendor agreement  we expense the engine maintenance costs as flight hours are incurred on the engines and using the contractual rate set forth in the agreement 
aircraft leases the majority of skywest airlines aircraft are leased from third parties  while expressjet s aircraft flying for delta are primarily debt financed on a long term basis and the majority of expressjet s aircraft are leased from continental for a nominal amount 
in order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
additionally  as of december   we had approximately million in intangible assets 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of certain of these assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
we recorded an intangible of approximately million relating to the acquisition of atlantic southeast in september the intangible is being amortized over fifteen years under the straight line method 
as of december   we had recorded million in accumulated amortization expense 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the condition of the long lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived assets 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate whether 
table of contents the book value of our aircraft is impaired 
based on the results of the evaluations  our management concluded no impairment was necessary as of december  however  there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 
stock based compensation expense we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee termination in the option pricing model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock and other factors 
fair value we hold certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value in accordance with united states gaap 
we determined fair value of these assets based on the following three levels of inputs level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
some of our marketable securities primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
we utilize several valuation techniques in order to assess the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities 
our cash and cash equivalents primarily utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
we have valued non auction rate marketable securities using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
if a quoted price is not available  we utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
for auction rate security instruments  quoted prices in active markets are no longer available 
as a result  we have estimated the fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
results of operations our business segments for the year ended december   we had two reportable segments which are the basis of our internal financial reporting skywest airlines and expressjet which reflects the combined operations of atlantic southeast and expressjet delaware 
on december   we completed the expressjet combination  which ended expressjet delaware s existence as a separate entity 
on november   we completed the expressjet merger 
our operating revenues  airline expenses and segment

table of contents revenues 
operating revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
for financial reporting purposes  we record these reimbursements as operating revenue 
under the skywest airlines and expressjet delta connection agreements and the continental cpa  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expenses as incurred 
we also record those engine overhaul reimbursements as operating revenue 
the following table summarizes the amount of fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements included in our passenger revenues for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  change change passenger revenues less fuel reimbursement from major partners less engine overhaul reimbursement from major partners passenger revenue excluding fuel and engine overhauls reimbursements passenger revenues 
passenger revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
our passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements from major partners  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements  was primarily due to an increase in block hours of during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the block hour increase was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
the increase in passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements  was less than the increase in block hours primarily due to differences between the continental express agreement and our other code share agreements 
under the continental express agreement  continental pays for more costs directly such as station rents and aircraft ownership and as such  there are no associated reimbursements recognized as revenue on costs paid directly by continental 
under our other code share agreements  the majority of those costs are paid by skywest and expressjet and the reimbursements received from their major partners are included in revenue 
as such we do not expect the expressjet operations to increase revenue at the same rate as the projected increase in block hours 
in addition  the delta connection agreements also provide that  beginning with the fifth anniversary of the execution of the agreements september   delta has the right to require that certain contractual rates under those agreements shall not exceed the second lowest rates of all carriers within the delta connection program 
during the fourth quarter of  skywest airlines and atlantic southeast reached an agreement with delta on contractual rates satisfying the second lowest rate provision and agreed on rates through december  delta additionally waived its right to require that the contractual rates payable under the delta connection agreements shall not exceed the second lowest of all carriers within the delta connection program through december  as a result of the negotiated adjustment of the contractual rates under the delta connection agreements  our passenger revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million lower than they would have been under the rates that existed prior to the adjustment 
additionally  skywest airlines and atlantic southeast finalized certain contractual rates from september  through december  with delta 
as a result  we recorded million in additional revenue as a result of the finalization of contractual rates during the quarter ended december  under the terms 
table of contents of the skywest airlines and expressjet delta connection agreements  delta has agreed to compensate skywest airlines and expressjet for initiatives that directly result in pass through cost savings 
delta agreed to share such savings with skywest airlines and expressjet on an equal basis for a twelve month period 
during the three months ended december   delta paid  and skywest airlines and atlantic southeast recognized  approximately million in cost savings revenue 
we did not receive similar payments during the year ended december  in addition  under our expressjet delta connection agreement and our skywest airlines and expressjet united express agreements we are paid an incentive compensation upon the achievement of certain performance criteria 
our passenger revenues for the year ended december  were million lower compared to the year ended december   due primarily to our receipt of lower incentive payments 
ground handling and other 
total ground handling and other revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue attributed to ground handling services for our aircraft is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations under the heading passenger revenues and revenue attributed to handling third party aircraft is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations under the heading ground handling and other 
the increase in ground handling and other revenues was primarily related to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger and aircraft rental revenue received from other airlines 
during the year ended december   we obtained leases for four crjs and subleased those aircraft to air mekong 
individual expense components attributable to our operations are expressed in the following table on the basis of cents per asm 
asm is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline s passenger capacity 
asms reflect both the number of aircraft in an airline s fleet and the seat capacity for the aircraft in the fleet 
as the size of our fleet is the underlying driver of our operating costs  the primary basis for our presentation of the following information on a cost per asm basis is to discuss significant changes in our costs not proportionate to the relative changes in our fleet size dollar amounts in thousands

salaries  wages and benefits increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average number of full time equivalent employees increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   due primarily to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repair costs increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the following table summarizes the amount of engine overhauls and engine overhaul reimbursements included in our aircraft maintenance expense for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  change change aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs less engine overhaul reimbursed from major partners less crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rate aircraft maintenance excluding reimbursed engine overhauls and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rate aircraft maintenance expense  excluding reimbursed engine overhauls and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rates  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in maintenance expense  excluding engine overhaul costs  was principally due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger  higher than expected maintenance costs on scheduled events due to our aging fleet and replacement of aircraft parts and repairs in advance of our schedule 
we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj regional jet engines on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense 
under the skywest airlines and expressjet united express agreements  we recognize revenue at fixed hourly rates for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines 
accordingly  the timing of engine maintenance events associated with aircraft under the skywest airlines and expressjet united express agreements can have a significant impact on our financial results 
during the year ended december   our crj engine expense under our skywest airlines and expressjet united express agreements increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase in crj engine overhauls reimbursed at a fixed hourly rate was principally due to scheduled engine maintenance events 
we anticipate the number of scheduled engine maintenance events experienced during the year ended december  will likely continue through the middle of  after which we expect a reduction in the number of scheduled engine maintenance events 

table of contents under our delta connection agreements we are reimbursed for engine overhaul costs by delta at the time the maintenance event occurs 
under our continental express agreement  we are also reimbursed for actual engine overhaul costs by continental at the time the expense is incurred 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rental expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
approximately  million of the additional aircraft rental expense was attributable to aircraft operated under the expressjet united express agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
without the expansion of the expressjet delaware operations  station rentals and landing fees would have decreased  primarily due to our major partners paying for certain station rents and landing fees directly to the applicable airports 
ground handling service 
ground handling service expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in ground handling service expense was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
acquisition related costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of direct severance  legal and advisor fees associated with the expressjet merger and integration related costs  including advisory fees to assist atlantic southeast and expressjet in their efforts to operate under a single operating certificate 
other expenses 
other expenses  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in other expenses was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in long term debt 
at december   we had  million of long term debt  compared to  million of debt as of december  total airline expenses 
total airline expenses consisting of total operating and interest expenses increased  million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
we record the amount of those reimbursements as revenue 
under the skywest airlines and expressjet delta connection agreements and the continental cpa  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expense  which we record as revenue

interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was due primarily to the retirement of a secured term loan that united repaid on august   which had an interest rate of 
other  net 
other expenses  net increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  other expense primarily consist of earnings and losses from our investments in trip and air mekong  which we account for under the equity method of accounting 
the increase in other expense was due primarily to our recognition of our portion of the losses incurred by trip and air mekong 
purchase accounting gain adjustment 
in connection with our preparation of the tax return  our management identified an adjustment to the expressjet acquisition accounting that resulted in an increase to the acquired deferred tax liabilities of million 
the adjustment is reflected on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  under the caption purchase accounting gain adjustment 
net income loss 
primarily due to factors described above  we incurred a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   we had two reportable segments which are the basis of our internal financial reporting skywest airlines and expressjet

first  atlantic southeast experienced an abnormally high number of flight cancellations  primarily due to weather problems in its atlanta hub  during the year ended december  additionally  on march   as a result of an internal audit  atlantic southeast grounded crj aircraft in order to perform engine safety inspections in accordance with the manufacturer s recommendations 
consequently  atlantic southeast cancelled approximately more flights than normal as a result of the severe weather and the aircraft grounding during the three months ended march  those cancelations contributed to an increase in passenger revenue of approximately million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  second  our block hour production increased during the year end december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in block hours was primarily due to skywest airlines taking incremental delivery of crj s subsequent to april   and the completion of the expressjet merger on november  third  during the three months ended december   skywest airlines and atlantic southeast finalized certain contractual rates from september  through december  with delta 
as a result  we recorded million in additional revenue as a result of the finalization of contractual rates during the quarter ended december  fourth  under the terms of the skywest airlines and expressjet delta connection agreements  delta has agreed to compensate skywest airlines and atlantic southeast now expressjet for initiatives that directly result in pass through cost savings

we anticipate that the average number of scheduled engine maintenance events experienced during the years ended december  and december  will likely continue through the middle of  after which we expect a reduction in the number of scheduled engine maintenance events 
under our delta connection agreements we are reimbursed for engine overhaul costs by delta at the time the maintenance event occurs 
under our continental cpa  we are also reimbursed for actual engine cost by continental at the time the expense is incurred 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following two factors first  during the year ended december   we obtained leases for four crjs and subleased the aircraft to air mekong 
second  we completed the expressjet merger on november  expressjet incurred approximately million in aircraft rental expense since the completion of the expressjet merger 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to skywest airlines taking incremental delivery of new crjs since april  these aircraft were financed through long term debt 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to the acquisition of expressjet delaware on november  and related additional station rental expense 

table of contents ground handling service 
ground handling service expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in ground handling expense was due primarily to new pro rate stations skywest airlines outsourced to other ground handlers since january  acquisition related costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of direct severance  legal and advisor fees associated with the expressjet merger 
other expenses 
other expenses  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in other expenses was primarily due to the completion of the expressjet merger on november  total airline expenses 
total airline expenses consisting of total operating and interest expenses increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
we record the amount of those reimbursements as revenue 
under the skywest airlines and expressjet delta connection agreements and the continental cpa  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expense  which we record as revenue 
the following table summarizes the amount of fuel and engine overhaul expenses which are included in our total airline expenses for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  change change total airline expense less fuel expense less engine overhaul reimbursement from major partners less crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rate total airline expense excluding fuel and engine overhauls and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rate excluding fuel and engine overhaul costs and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rates  our total airline expenses increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the percentage increase in total airline expenses excluding fuel and engine overhauls  was less than the percentage increase in asms  which was primarily due to the increased operating efficiencies obtained from operating larger regional jets 
impairment of marketable securities 
as a result of an ongoing valuation review of our marketable securities portfolio  we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately million during the year ended december  for certain marketable securities deemed to have other than temporary impairment 
we did not experience a corresponding charge during the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased million  or during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest income was due primarily to the secured term loan skywest airlines extended to united during the fourth quarter of in the amount of million 
the term loan bore interest at a rate of  with a ten year amortization period 
skywest airlines also agreed to defer million otherwise payable to skywest airlines under the skywest airlines united express agreement 
this amount accrues a deferral fee of which is reported in our consolidated statement of income as interest income 
on august   united repaid the million term loan together with accrued interest 

table of contents purchase accounting gain 
on november   we completed the expressjet merger 
as a result of the expressjet merger  we recorded a purchase accounting gain of million on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  this amount represents the difference between the consideration paid and the estimated net fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the estimated net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was more than the purchase price 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased to in from in the reduction of reflects the impact of a purchase accounting gain that does not have a tax effect  resulting in a decrease in the rate of approximately 
this decrease was offset by an increase of approximately resulting from a decrease in tax exempt interest income and an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes 
net income 
primarily due to factors described above  net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash cash position and liquidity 
the following table provides a summary of the net cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december  and  and our total cash and marketable securities position as of december  and december  in thousands 
for the year ended december  change change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities december  december  change change cash and cash equivalents restricted cash marketable securities total cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the pre tax loss we incurred during the year ended december   compared to the pre tax income we realized during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we had a pre tax loss of million  compared to pre tax income of million for the year ended december  cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  during the year ended 
table of contents december   net sales of marketable securities increased million  as compared to the year ended december  our aircraft and rotable spare parts purchased increased million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we believe that in the absence of unusual circumstances  the working capital currently available to us and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our present financial requirements  including anticipated expansion  planned capital expenditures  and scheduled lease payments and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
at december   our total capital mix was equity and long term debt  compared to equity and long term debt at december  as of december  and  skywest airlines had a million line of credit 
as of december  and  skywest airlines had no amount outstanding under the facility 
the facility expires on march  and has a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions 
as of december  and  we classified million and million as restricted cash  respectively  related to our workers compensation policies 
significant commitments and obligations general the following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations interest commitments a principal maturities on long term debt total commitments and obligations a at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt 
interest commitments will change based on the actual variable interest 
purchase commitments and options we have not historically funded a substantial portion of our aircraft acquisitions with working capital 
rather  we have generally funded our aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and long term debt financing 
at the time of each aircraft acquisition  we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us  and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition 
in the event that alternative financing cannot be arranged at the time of delivery  bombardier has typically 
table of contents financed our aircraft acquisitions until more permanent arrangements can be made 
subsequent to this initial acquisition of an aircraft  we may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another eg  replacing debt financing with leveraged lease financing 
at present  we intend to fund our acquisition of any additional aircraft through a combination of operating leases and debt financing  consistent with our historical practices 
based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions  we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions  as well as additional aircraft  without materially reducing the amount of working capital available for our operating activities 
nonetheless  recent disruptions in the credit markets have resulted in greater volatility  decreased liquidity and limited availability of capital  and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary funding or that  if we are able to obtain necessary capital  the corresponding terms will be favorable or acceptable to us 
aircraft lease and facility obligations we also have significant long term lease obligations  primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
at december   we had aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  assuming a discount rate  which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  long term debt obligations as of december   we had billion of long term debt obligations related to the acquisition of crj  crj and crj aircraft 
the average effective interest rate on the debt related to the crj aircraft was approximately at december  guarantees we have guaranteed the obligations of skywest airlines under the skywest airlines delta connection agreement and the obligations of expressjet under the expressjet delta connection agreement and skywest and expressjet have guaranteed the obligations of expressjet under the continental cpa 
new accounting standards fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in may  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the standard revises guidance for fair value measurement and expands the disclosure requirements 
it is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that our adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued presentation of comprehensive income 
the standard revises the presentation and prominence of the items reported in other comprehensive income 
it is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we intend to adopt this standard for the quarter ending march  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  we have not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and we currently expect to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet our future needs 
pursuant to our contract flying arrangements  united and continental have agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our contracted united express and continental express flights 
on our delta connection regional jet flights  delta has agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
we bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our pro rate operations 
as of december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements while  approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under pro rate arrangements 
as of december   we operated crjs for united under a pro rate agreement 
the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of the market risk of fuel on our pro rate operations using a hypothetical increase of in the price per gallon we purchase 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in fuel expense for the year ended december  interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
we would also receive higher amounts of interest income on cash and securities held at the time  however  the market value of our available for sale securities would likely decline 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt compared to of our long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of market risk using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december   and we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  however  under our contractual arrangement with our major partners  the majority of the increase in interest expense would be passed through and recorded as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
if interest rates were to decline  our major partners would receive the principal benefit of the decline  since interest expense is generally passed through to our major partners  resulting in a reduction to passenger revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through manufacturer financing  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact the actual cost to us to acquire these aircraft 
to the extent we place these aircraft in service under our code share agreements with delta  united  continental or other carriers  our code share agreements currently provide that reimbursement rates will be adjusted higher or lower to reflect changes in our aircraft rental rates 
auction rate securities we have investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as available for sale securities and reflected at fair value 
due primarily to instability in credit markets over the past three years  we sold a portion of these investments 
as of december   we had investments valued at a total of million which were classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
for a more detailed discussion on auction rate securities  including our methodology for estimating their fair value  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report
