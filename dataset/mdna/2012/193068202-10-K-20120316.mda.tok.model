table of contents executive summary net sales decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this percent decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a percent decrease in comparable premium retail store sales in our retail segment and a decrease of percent in our direct segment net sales  offset by million of a cumulative one time adjustment reflecting a change in our estimate of gift card breakage 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or percent of net sales  compared to million  or percent of net sales  for fiscal the decline in gross profit margin was primarily due to the deleveraging of fixed expenses given the lower sales  partially offset by higher merchandise margins and the benefit resulting from the cumulative one time adjustment for gift card breakage income

results in fiscal include million of non cash impairment charges  or per share  related to certain retail store assets and technology investments 
we ended fiscal with million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at the end of fiscal as of january   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
working capital was million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal premium retail store inventory per square foot  including retail inventory in our distribution center  declined percent at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal total inventory decreased percent to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal company initiatives for fiscal  we are focused on completing the initiatives that we believe are necessary to move the business beyond the turnaround phase and return to growth 
we expect to demonstrate steady improvements in sales productivity and progress toward profitability through the course of fiscal as we emphasize three strategic priorities  including continuing to evolve and elevate our merchandise  strengthening our brand messaging  and improving our marketing effectiveness to drive increased traffic to all channels 
we define comparable premium retail stores as those stores in which the gross square footage has not changed by more than percent in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months provided that store has been considered comparable for the entire quarter without closure for seven consecutive days or moving to a different temporary or permanent location 
due to the extensive promotions that occur as part of the opening of a premium store  we believe waiting months rather than months to consider a store to be comparable provides a better view of the growth pattern of the premium retail store base 
the calculation of comparable store sales varies across the retail industry and  as a result  the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation 

table of contents the first priority is to continue to evolve our product assortment to offer more compelling  unique fashions by offering a lifestyle focused collection that will enable us to broaden the product appeal  improve inventory productivity  and strengthen our supply chain capabilities 
the second priority is to refine the coldwater creek brand messaging to enable us to expand our customer base 
the brand messaging will highlight what makes coldwater creek unique  such as our distinctive looks  expressive colors  and fashion right offerings 
in the retail stores  the focus is on creating stronger key item and fashion story messages that are impactful  drive traffic  and elevate the brand 
in the direct channel  the catalog will continue to evolve to reflect a more elevated look and layout  and the on line channel will provide enhanced content and functionality 
the third priority is to improve overall traffic levels in all channels 
in fiscal  we plan to extend the reach and quality of our advertising platforms by developing differentiated  creative campaigns designed to extend the brand to new customers by utilizing a combination of print  on line  and television advertising 
in fiscal  we also plan to expand our location based marketing programs 
as part of this initiative  we recently launched the next generation coldwater creek loyalty program 
over the course of fiscal  we plan to add enhanced functionality to our e commerce platform  continue to develop and evolve tablet and mobile applications  and improve the integration of our on line and in store shopping experience by providing customers with a view to product availability in stores 
as part of our ongoing store optimization plan that we announced earlier in fiscal  we closed premium retail stores in fiscal and we plan to close approximately premium retail stores in fiscal we are on track to meet our expectations of closing between and stores between fiscal and fiscal outlook we have made significant changes to both people and processes over the past two years to enable us to evolve the coldwater creek brand to what customers are looking for today 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to see the benefits of these investments in the form of significantly higher merchandise margins and meaningful improvements in comparable premium retail store sales trends  which gives us confidence that we are moving in the right direction 
we expect that a competitive promotional environment will continue 
in addition  weakness in consumer spending persists as a result of continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions reflected in reduced incomes and asset values  high unemployment and deterioration in the housing market 
we believe these conditions continue to have a negative impact on our sales  gross margin and operating performance 
we remain committed to disciplined management of expenses and inventory and expect to reduce sg a year over year by million to million in fiscal  taking into account that fiscal has weeks 
also for fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to be million to million and depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately million 
if we are in a loss position for a quarter or the year  we do not expect to generate any significant federal income tax benefit due to our valuation allowance and we may incur a small expense as a result of various state taxation requirements

also contributing to the decrease in retail segment net sales during fiscal as compared with fiscal was a million decrease in net sales from outlet stores

we believe the decrease in our direct segment order volume is attributed to a decrease in overall consumer response to our product assortment 
direct segment net sales were also negatively impacted by decreases of million and million in shipping revenue and co branded credit card program revenue  respectively  during fiscal as compared with fiscal the decrease in shipping revenue is primarily associated with decreases in realized shipping rates and order volume  as well as an increase in free shipping promotions 
gross profit the gross profit rate decreased by percentage points during fiscal as compared to fiscal the gross profit rate was negatively impacted by deleveraging of our retail occupancy costs and higher buying and distribution costs of percentage points and percentage points  respectively 
these decreases in gross profit rate were offset by a percentage point increase attributable to higher initial merchandise markups  which was partially offset by increases in promotional discounts and our markdown rate

direct segment operating income rate expressed as a percentage of direct segment sales for fiscal as compared with fiscal remained flat 
increased clearance activity  partially offset by higher merchandise markups  resulted in a percentage point decrease in merchandise margins 
the deleveraging of marketing expenses also contributed a percentage point decrease in operating income 
these decreases in operating income were offset by a and percentage point decrease in employee related expenses and other fixed and variable costs  respectively 
unallocated corporate and other expenses decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a decrease in marketing expenses  primarily as a result of decreased national magazine advertising campaigns  and decreases in employee related expenses and corporate support costs 

table of contents interest expense  net  and other the increase in interest expense  net and other for fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense on our capital lease and other financing obligations 
income tax provision benefit the tax benefit for fiscal primarily reflects the continuing impact of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the provision for income taxes of million in fiscal reflects the establishment of valuation allowances for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
seasonality as with many apparel retailers  our net sales  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of a number of factors  including the following the composition  size and timing of various merchandise offerings  the timing and number of premium retail store openings and closings  the timing and number of promotions  the timing and number of catalog mailings  customer response to merchandise offerings  including the impact of economic and weather related influences  the actions of competitors and similar factors  the ability to accurately estimate our recorded sales returns accrual and inventory adjustments  market price fluctuations in critical materials and services  including paper  production  postage and telecommunications costs  the timing of merchandise shipping and receiving  including any delays resulting from labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  health epidemics or national security measures  and shifts in the timing of important holiday selling seasons relative to our fiscal quarters  including valentine s day  easter  mother s day  thanksgiving and christmas 
our results continue to depend materially on sales and profits from the november and december holiday shopping season 
in anticipation of traditionally increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforce 
additionally  as gift items and accessories are more prominently represented in the november and december holiday season merchandise offerings  we typically expect  absent offsetting factors  to realize higher consolidated gross margins and earnings in the second half of our fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources on october   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock 
we received net proceeds from the offering of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
the net proceeds from the offering are used for working capital and other capital expenditures  including investments in our marketing strategy and supply chain  as well as other general corporate purposes 
during fiscal  we entered into a credit facility with wells fargo bank  which is secured primarily by our inventory and credit card receivables and provides a revolving line of credit of up to 
table of contents million  with subfacilities for the issuance of up to million in letters of credit and swingline advances of up to million 
the actual amount of credit that is available from time to time under the revolving line of credit is limited to a borrowing base amount that is determined according to  among other things  a percentage of the value of eligible inventory plus a percentage of the value of eligible credit card receivables  as reduced by certain reserve amounts that may be required by the lender 
on may   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  which  among other things  extended the maturity date to may   provided a million term loan due on may   and granted the lenders a security interest in our sandpoint  idaho corporate offices and certain other assets 
the amount available under the million revolving line of credit remains unchanged  however  we now have a future option to request an increase in the amount of the revolving line of credit for an additional million  which if granted would result in a total of up to million available  exclusive of the term loan 
as of january   the revolving line of credit was limited to a borrowing base of million and we had million in letters of credit issued and million borrowed on our revolving line of credit  resulting in million available for borrowing under our revolving line of credit 
pursuant to the credit agreement  borrowings under the revolving line of credit will generally accrue interest at a rate ranging from to determined according to the average unused availability under the credit facility the availability over a reference rate of  at our election  either libor or a base rate the reference rate with an interest rate of as of january  letters of credit issued under the revolving line of credit will accrue interest at a rate ranging from to determined according to the availability with an interest rate of as of january  commitment fees accrue at a rate ranging from to determined according to the availability  which is assessed on the average unused portion of the credit facility maximum amount 
the term loan accrues interest at a rate of over the reference rate  with an interest rate of as of january  the credit agreement has restrictive covenants with respect to capital expenditure limitations  minimum amount of inventory to be held and minimum excess availability over the borrowing base that must be maintained 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants relating to customary matters  such as indebtedness  liens  investments  acquisitions  mergers  dispositions and other payment restriction conditions  such as limits on our ability to pay dividends when we have outstanding borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
we were in compliance with all covenants for all periods presented 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this type 
upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods  in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders  the obligations under the credit agreement may be accelerated  outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million during fiscal and  respectively  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted primarily from the increased net loss offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted primarily from decreased net sales and gross margins as well as a decrease in tax refunds received of million 
we also experienced decreases of million and million in cash collected on tenant allowances and fees collected from the co branded credit card program  respectively 
these decreases were offset by lower operating expenses 
net cash used in investing activities principally consisted of cash outflows for capital expenditures which totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  
table of contents respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of five additional premium retail stores  the remodeling of certain existing stores and the continued development of our it infrastructure 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores  four outlet stores and to a lesser extent the remodeling of certain existing stores and the expansion of our it and distribution infrastructure 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of eight additional premium retail stores  two outlet stores  two premium retail stores under construction  the remodeling of certain existing stores  the relocation of our new york design office  and the expansion of our it and distribution infrastructure 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the cash inflows during fiscal were primarily derived from proceeds of million from our stock offering  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  borrowings of million on our revolving line of credit in the third quarter of fiscal  and proceeds from our million term loan obtained in the second quarter of fiscal net cash outflows during fiscal  and were primarily due to payments on our capital lease and other financing obligations 
as a result of the foregoing  we had million in working capital at january  compared with million in working capital at january  our current ratio was at january  compared with at january  as of january   we had million outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
we plan to limit new store openings to one premium retail store and one outlet store in fiscal  and will continue to evaluate real estate opportunities to improve the efficiency of our store base  including the potential of relocating stores to more favorable locations and reducing overall store size 
in line with our store optimization program announced during fiscal  we expect to close approximately premium retail stores in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between million and million 
historically  we have relied on our cash resources and cash flows from operations to fund our operations 
we have also used our revolving line of credit to secure trade letters of credit and from time to time for borrowings  both of which reduce the amount available for borrowing 
the actual amount of credit that is available from time to time under our revolving line of credit fluctuates and is limited to the borrowing base amount 
consequently  it is possible that  should we need to access any additional funds from our revolving line of credit  it may not be available in full 
we believe we have sufficient cash and liquidity  including our revolving line of credit that we may continue to draw on from time to time  to fund our operations through the next months 
however  we have had recurring operating losses and if our future operating performance is below our expectations  or our revolving line of credit is not fully available to us  our cash and liquidity could be adversely impacted 
constraints on liquidity make us vulnerable to further downturns in our business or the general economy and a shortfall would have serious consequences for our business  such as forcing us to curtail our operations 
additionally  lack of capital could restrict our ability to react to changes in our business or to take advantage of opportunities as they arise  including opportunities designed to accelerate our turnaround 
for these reasons we may access the capital markets for additional debt or equity financing 
if we borrow additional amounts under our revolving line of credit or incur other debt  our interest expense will increase and we may be subject to additional covenants that could restrict our operations 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities could result in significant dilution to our current stockholders  particularly given our low stock price in recent periods 
newly issued securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise 
table of contents superior to those of our common stock 
there is no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
off balance sheet liabilities and other contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
the following tables summarize our minimum contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of january  payments due in fiscal year total thereafter in thousands operating leases a d contractual commitments b debt  including estimated interest payments c capital leases d benefit obligations e total a we have a significant operating lease for our  square foot distribution center located in mineral wells  west virginia  with a remaining lease commitment as of january  of million 
all other operating leases primarily pertain to retail and outlet stores  day spas and various equipment 
certain store leases have provisions to adjust the payment based on certain criteria  for example additional rent for our store sales above a specified minimum or less rent based on landlord vacancy rates below a specified minimum 
the operating lease obligations noted above do not include any of these adjustments or payments made for maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes 
several lease agreements provide renewal options or allow for termination rights under certain circumstances 
future operating lease obligations would change if these renewal options or termination rights were exercised 
b contractual commitments include commitments to purchase inventory of million and capital expenditures of million 
the timing of the payments is subject to change based upon actual receipt of the inventory or capital asset and the terms of payment with the vendor 
c our credit agreement matures on may   however  the million outstanding on our revolving line of credit as of january  is considered to be a current obligation as terms generally less than days are used to lock in preferred interest rates 
interest payments on our term loan and revolving line of credit were estimated using the effective interest rate as of january  and assuming interest payments on million outstanding on our revolving line of credit for the next months 
d the primary capital lease is for our  square foot facility located in coeur d alene  idaho  which functions as a customer contact center  it data center  and office space 
this lease was amended on april  resulting in the lease classified as a capital lease through july  with a remaining capital lease commitment as of january  of million  and as an operating lease from august through july  with a remaining operating lease commitment as of january  of million 
all other capital leases pertain to various technology equipment and other real estate 
the capital lease obligations represent the minimum payments including principal and interest  and excluding maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes

unrecognized tax benefits as of january  are not included in the contractual obligations table presented above because the timing of the settlements cannot be fully determined 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
as a result  actual results could differ because of the use of estimates 
note  significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  as described below  include those that require us to make estimates about matters that are uncertain and could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
sales returns we recognize sales and the related cost of sales for our direct segment at the time the merchandise is expected to be delivered to our customer and for our retail segment at the point of sale with a customer in a store 
we reduce our sales and cost of sales and establish an accrual for expected sales returns based on historical experience and future expectations 
the ability to reasonably estimate sales returns is made more complex by the fact that we offer our customers a return policy whereby they may return merchandise for any reason and at any time without any restrictions as to condition or time of purchase to any of our locations 
the actual amount of sales returns we subsequently realize may fluctuate from estimates due to several factors  including size and fit  merchandise mix  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in the catalog or website  timeliness of delivery and competitive offerings 
we continually track subsequent sales return experience  compile customer feedback to identify any pervasive issues  reassess the marketplace  compare our findings to previous estimates and adjust the accrual accordingly 
provisions for sales returns were as follows fiscal year ended january  january  january  in thousands balance at beginning of period additions charged to income deductions for actual returns adjustments recorded to income balance at end of period gift card breakage proceeds from the sale of gift cards and certificates are recorded as a liability and are recognized as net sales when the cards are redeemed for merchandise 
our gift cards do not have an expiration date 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  we only recognized breakage income from the non escheated portion of unredeemed gift cards after the filing of the corresponding escheatment to the relevant jurisdictions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified a history of redemption patterns associated with our gift cards that support a change in our estimate of the term over which we should 
table of contents recognize income on gift card breakage 
based on historical information  the likelihood of a gift card remaining unredeemed can be reasonably estimated at the time of gift card issuance 
breakage income is recognized over the estimated average redemption period of redeemed gift cards  for those gift cards for which the likelihood of redemption is deemed to be remote and for the amount for which there is no legal obligation for us to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to any relevant jurisdictions 
gift card breakage income is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of a cumulative one time adjustment reflecting the change in our estimate of gift card breakage 
inventory adjustments our inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
the nature of our business requires that we make substantially all of our merchandising and marketing decisions and corresponding inventory purchase commitments with vendors several months in advance of the time in which a particular merchandise item is intended to be included in the merchandise offerings 
these decisions and commitments are based upon  among other possible considerations  historical sales with identical or similar merchandise  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  and an assessment of likely economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually make assessments as to whether the carrying cost of inventory exceeds its market value  and  if so  by what dollar amount 
to determine whether inventory should be written down we consider current and anticipated demand and customer preferences in addition to the current and future estimated selling price 
the carrying value of the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value with a corresponding charge to cost of sales 
actual results may differ from our estimates if we are required to markdown or discount merchandise beyond our current expectations 
for the inventory marked down to net realizable value  a one percentage point increase in our adjustment rate at january  would have affected net loss by less than million 
we estimate and record physical inventory losses that have occurred since our last physical inventory date by applying the most recent average physical inventory loss experience 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss estimate 
however  if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
stock based compensation the calculation of stock based compensation expense requires us to expense the fair value of equity awards over the requisite employee service period  which is generally the vesting period 
calculating the fair value of stock options on the date of grant requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life and pre vesting forfeitures 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based upon a combination of both the implied and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns 
an increase in expected volatility or expected life would result in an increase in the fair value of our stock options and higher compensation expense  while a decrease in expected volatility or expected life would result in a decrease in the fair value of our stock options and lower compensation expense 
we also grant various restricted stock units which are generally less subjective in determining fair value as the fair value of these awards is based primarily upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate forfeitures for all of our equity awards based upon historical experience  and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
we revise our estimated forfeitures in subsequent periods  when necessary  if actual forfeitures vary from those originally estimated 
we believe that our estimates are based upon outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
if actual forfeitures vary from 
table of contents our estimates  compensation expense would vary from what we record in the current and prior fiscal years 
total stock based compensation expense during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  we then determine the fair value of the asset generally by using a discounted cash flow model 
a loss is recognized  if any  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value 
in assessing future cash flows  management is required to make assumptions and judgments  including forecasting future sales  margins and operating expenses over the estimated remaining useful life 
these assumptions and judgments can be affected by consumer spending and overall economic conditions on a localized or regional basis  as well as other factors not necessarily within our control 
during fiscal  we experienced a decrease in consumer spending and low traffic levels which had a negative impact on our revenue  gross margins  operating cash flows and earnings  resulting in our need to evaluate certain asset groups for impairment 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million related to certain long lived assets  primarily premium store leasehold improvements 
a decrease in our expected future cash flows of percent throughout the forecast period would have increased our fiscal store impairment charges by less than million 
if consumer spending on apparel and accessories remains subdued with low demand for our product  it is possible that we could record additional impairments of certain long lived assets in the future 
contingencies an estimated loss from a contingency is recorded if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
we are involved in litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
actions filed against us from time to time include commercial  intellectual property infringement  customer and employment claims  including class action lawsuits alleging that we violated federal and state wage and hour and other laws 
the assessment of the outcome of litigation can be very difficult to predict as it is subject to many factors  including those not within our control  and is highly dependent on individual facts and circumstances 
litigation is subject to highly complex legal processes and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been recorded in the financial statements 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  as measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the periods where temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled 
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
we consider all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become

in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
current or previous losses are given more weight than projected future performance 
consequently  based on all available evidence  in particular our three year historical cumulative losses and recent operating losses  we have a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets 
when the results of our operations demonstrate a sustained level of taxable income it may become more likely than not that all or a part of the net deferred tax assets will be realized which could result in the reduction of the valuation allowance 
the determination of when to reduce a valuation allowance requires significant judgment by management in determining the appropriate level of evidence to objectively support the realization of the net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance activity on net deferred tax assets was as follows fiscal year ended january  january  january  in thousands balance at beginning of period net additions charged to income tax expense other adjustments to comprehensive income balance at end of period item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in  us dollars or us dollar based currencies 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes and have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments 
as of january   we had outstanding debt of million under our variable rate term loan and million under our revolving line of credit 
the impact of a hypothetical percent adverse change in interest rates for our debt would not have resulted in a material amount of additional expense for fiscal as of january   we did not have borrowings under our credit facility and  consequently  did not have any material exposure to interest rate market risks for fiscal
