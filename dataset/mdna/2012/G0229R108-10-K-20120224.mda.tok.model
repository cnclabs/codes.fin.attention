table of contents bermuda the insurance and reinsurance industry in bermuda is regulated by the bermuda monetary authority  or the bma 
alterra bermuda is regulated by the bma under the insurance act of bermuda and its related regulations  which we refer to collectively as the bermuda insurance act 
the bermuda insurance act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on alterra bermuda and grants to the bma powers to supervise  investigate and intervene in the affairs of bermuda insurance and reinsurance companies 
alterra bermuda is required to prepare and file annual financial statements in accordance with us gaap  annual statutory financial statements  an annual statutory financial return and an annual capital and solvency return  which comprises a statutory risk based capital model  a schedule of fixed income investments by rating categories  a schedule of net reserves for losses and loss expense provisions by line of business  a schedule of premiums written by line of business and a schedule of risk management

the enhanced capital requirement is determined by reference to a statutory risk based capital model that determines a control threshold for statutory capital and surplus 
if a company fails to maintain or meet the control level  various degrees of regulatory action may be taken by the bma 
in addition  in an effort to achieve equivalency with european union regulators under the solvency ii directive  the bma may  in respect of an insurance group  determine whether it is appropriate for it to be the group supervisor of that group 
the bma has determined that it will act as the group supervisor of the company and has designated alterra bermuda as the designated insurer 
the bma has introduced rules that implement a group supervision regime and enhance the group capital and solvency framework 
the company is required to prepare and file annual group statutory financial statements  an annual group statutory financial return and an annual group capital and solvency return in addition to quarterly financial returns 
alterra bermuda is subject to the insurance code of conduct  or the insurance code  which establishes duties and standards that must be complied with by all insurers registered under the insurance act 
non compliance with the insurance code could result in intervention by the bma 
the bma also monitors each insurer s compliance with the insurance code and may use it as a factor in calculating the applicable operational risk charge in accordance with that insurer s risk based capital model 
pursuant to the bermuda insurance act  any person who becomes a holder of at least   or of our common shares must notify the bma in writing within days of becoming such a holder 
the bma has the power to object to a person holding or more of our common shares if the bma determines that the person is not a fit and proper person to be a controller of the registered insurer

ireland the insurance and reinsurance industry in ireland is regulated by the central bank of ireland  or the cbi 
our irish operating subsidiary  alterra europe  is subject to regulation by the cbi under a variety of irish rules and regulations 
alterra europe must comply with the irish insurance acts to  regulations promulgated thereunder  regulations relating to insurance business promulgated under the european communities act  the irish central bank acts to  as amended  regulations promulgated thereunder and directions and guidelines and codes of conduct issued by the cbi  which we refer to collectively as the insurance acts and regulations

assets constituting statutory reserves must comply with admissibility  diversification  localization and currency matching rules 
statutory reserves must be actuarially certified annually 
anyone acquiring or disposing of a direct or indirect holding in an irish authorized insurance company that represents or more of the capital or of the voting rights of such company or that makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of such company  or anyone who proposes to decrease or increase that holding to specified levels  must first notify the cbi of their intention to do so 
any irish authorized insurance company that becomes aware of any acquisitions or disposal of its capital involving the specified levels must also notify the cbi 
the specified levels are  and or such other level or ownership that results in the company becoming the acquirer s subsidiary within the meaning of article of the european communities non life insurance framework regulations the cbi has three months from the date of submission of a notification within which to oppose the proposed transaction if the cbi is not satisfied as to the suitability of the acquirer in view of the necessity to ensure prudent and sound management of the insurance undertaking concerned 
as a result of these restrictions  no person  corporation or entity is permitted to acquire control of alterra  alterra europe or any intermediary company unless such person  corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval of the cbi 

table of contents alterra europe will be required to comply with the solvency ii directive when it is implemented 
we currently believe that european union member states will be required to enact solvency ii into national laws by january  and that it will apply to re insurers starting january  solvency ii takes a risk based approach to the authorization and supervision of re insurers 
it comprises three pillars dealing with quantitative requirements  including capital requirements  qualitative requirements  such as risk management and control systems  and supervisory reporting and disclosure requirements 
during and  the cbi will expect alterra europe to begin preparing for additional reporting requirements and generally to be able to demonstrate its preparedness for solvency ii 
united kingdom and lloyd s the financial services industry in the united kingdom is regulated by the financial services authority  or fsa 
the fsa regulates insurers  insurance intermediaries and lloyd s 
the fsa and lloyd s have common objectives in ensuring that the lloyd s market is appropriately regulated and  to minimize duplication  the fsa has arrangements with lloyd s for co operation on supervision and enforcement 
the lloyd s market permits its members to underwrite insurance and reinsurance risks through lloyd s syndicates 
members of lloyd s may participate on a syndicate for one or more underwriting years by providing capital to support the syndicate s underwriting activities 
all syndicates are managed by managing agents that receive fees and profit commissions in respect of the underwriting and administrative services they provide to the syndicates 
we participate in the lloyd s market through the syndicates 
alterra at lloyd s was the managing agent for each of the syndicates until december  effective january   management of syndicates and was transferred to an unaffiliated third party  with alterra at lloyd s continuing as the managing agent for syndicate alterra corporate capital limited and alterra corporate capital limited  or the alterra corporate capital vehicles  are corporate members of lloyd s and participate in the underwriting years of the syndicates for which they are a member 
by entering into a membership agreement with lloyd s  the alterra corporate capital vehicles have undertaken to comply with all byelaws and regulations of lloyd s as well as the provisions of the lloyd s acts and the financial services and markets act the syndicates  as well as the alterra corporate capital vehicles  alterra at lloyd s and their directors  are subject to the lloyd s regulatory regime 
both the fsa and lloyd s have powers to remove their respective authorization to manage lloyd s syndicates 
lloyd s approves annually the business plan of each of the syndicates along with any subsequent material changes  and the amount of capital required to support those plans 
alterra at lloyd s  as the managing agent of syndicate  is required to carry out a capital assessment of syndicate in order to determine whether any additional capital should be held by that syndicate on account of any particular risks arising from its business or operational infrastructure 
this assessment  known as an individual capital assessment  is reviewed and may be challenged by lloyd s 
during  the united kingdom intends to introduce legislation to create a new prudential regulation authority  the pra  and a new financial conduct authority  the fca  and transfer regulatory responsibility from the fsa to them 
responsibility for the prudential regulation of insurers will be transferred to the pra 
responsibility for the regulation of the conduct of business of insurers will be transferred to the fca 
the united kingdom intends for the pra and the fca to be fully operational by the beginning of united states alterra re usa is domiciled in connecticut and is licensed or accredited to provide reinsurance in all us states and the district of columbia 
the principal insurance regulatory authority of alterra re usa is the connecticut department of insurance 
alterra re usa is also subject to regulation by all state insurance departments and under all applicable state insurance laws 
alterra e s is domiciled and licensed in delaware as a property and casualty insurer 
alterra e s does not hold an insurance certificate of authority in any other jurisdiction  however  alterra e s is listed or authorized as an eligible surplus lines insurer in other us states along with the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
the principal insurance regulatory authority of alterra e s is the delaware department of insurance 
alterra e s is also subject to regulation as an eligible surplus lines insurer by state insurance departments and under applicable state insurance laws in each jurisdiction in which it is listed or authorized 
alterra america is domiciled in delaware and is admitted as a licensed insurer in all us states and the district of columbia 
the principal insurance regulatory authority of alterra america is the delaware department of insurance 
alterra america is also subject to regulation by all state insurance departments and under all applicable state insurance laws 
alterra re usa  alterra e s and alterra america are subject to the laws and regulations of their respective state of domicile  as well as any other state in the united states where they conduct business 
in states where the companies are admitted  the companies must comply with all insurance laws and regulations  including rate and form requirements  maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  surplus  liquidity and solvency standards 
they are also required to submit to periodic examinations of their 
table of contents respective financial condition  including risk based capital standards based upon the risk based capital model act adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners and adopted by the states 
these laws and regulations also sometimes restrict payments of dividends  reductions of capital and or the ability to make certain investments 
alterra  an insurance holding company  is subject to regulation under the delaware and connecticut insurance holding company system laws  as well as those of additional us states 
these laws and applicable regulations require periodic disclosure concerning  among other things  ownership structure and prior notice and non disapproval of certain affiliate transactions within the alterra holding company system 
furthermore  no person  corporation or other entity is permitted to acquire control of alterra  alterra re usa  alterra e s  alterra america or any intermediary company unless such person  corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval of the delaware and or connecticut insurance commissioner or obtained an applicable waiver or exemption 
the insurance holding company system laws in each of delaware and connecticut broadly define a change of control  and create a presumption of control when any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or any of its parent companies 
in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the dodd frank act  was enacted 
among other things  the dodd frank act authorizes the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws and streamlines the regulation of reinsurance and surplus lines insurance 
many provisions of the dodd frank act will become effective over time  and certain provisions of the dodd frank act require the implementation of regulations that have not yet been adopted 
other jurisdictions as a global provider of specialty insurance and reinsurance  we must comply with various regulatory requirements in jurisdictions where we provide coverage or have activities in addition to the principal jurisdictions discussed above 
for example  alterra europe and alterra at lloyd s must comply with applicable latin america regulatory requirements in connection with our latin american reinsurance operations  and alterra europe must comply with applicable german  swiss and united kingdom regulatory requirements in connection with its activities in those countries 
in addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which a reinsurer is licensed  a reinsurer s business operations are affected by regulatory requirements governing credit for reinsurance in other jurisdictions in which its ceding companies are located 
in general  a ceding company that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed  accredited or approved by the jurisdiction in which the ceding company files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums and loss reserves and loss expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer 
many jurisdictions also permit ceding companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted reinsurers if certain prescribed security arrangements are made 
because alterra bermuda is not licensed  accredited or approved in any jurisdiction other than bermuda  in certain instances our reinsurance customers require alterra bermuda to provide a letter of credit or enter into other security arrangements 
available information our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and all amendments to those reports and the proxy statement for our annual general meeting of shareholders are made available  free of charge  on our web site  http www

item a 
risk factors any of the following risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results 
these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face  but represent the risks that we believe are material 
however  there may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or of which we are not currently aware  and any of these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results 
risks related to our business our losses and loss adjustment expenses and benefits may exceed our loss and benefit reserves  which could significantly increase our liabilities and reduce our net income and could have a significant and negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the business that we insure and reinsure 
if we fail to assess these risks accurately  or if events or circumstances cause our estimates to be incorrect  we may not establish appropriate premium rates and our reserves may be inadequate to cover our losses and benefits 
if our actual claims experience is less favorable than our underlying assumptions  we will be required to increase our liabilities  which will reduce our net income and could have a significant and negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents reserves are actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of what we ultimately expect to pay on claims and benefits  based on facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claim frequency and severity  mortality and other variable factors  such as inflation 
our actual losses and benefits may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates contained in our financial statements 
the establishment of new reserves or the adjustment of reserves for reported claims could result in significant positive or negative changes to our financial condition or results of operations in any particular period 
reinsurance reserves are subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves primarily because a reinsurer relies on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that our ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks reinsured by us and the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
in addition  reinsurance reserves may be less reliable than insurance reserves because there is generally a longer lapse of time from the occurrence of the event to the reporting of the loss or benefit to the reinsurer to the ultimate resolution or settlement of the loss 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a significant and negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we seek to mitigate our loss exposure through a variety of methods 
we write many of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis 
excess of loss insurance and reinsurance indemnifies the insured against a specified amount of losses in excess of a specified amount 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by diversifying our business by class of business and type of peril and by using geographic zone limitations 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
many of our insurance and reinsurance contracts include loss limitation features that may not be enforceable in the manner that we intend  such as exclusions from coverage and choice of coverage provisions 
in addition  many of our reinsurance contracts do not contain aggregate loss limits  which means that there is no contractual limit to the amount of losses that we may be required to pay pursuant to such reinsurance contracts 
we purchase a substantial amount of reinsurance in order to reduce our loss exposure to various risks 
we may be unable to collect all amounts due from our reinsurers under our reinsurance agreements 
the failure of any our loss limitation methods could have a significant and negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to write insurance and reinsurance is affected by cyclical trends and by global economic conditions and fluctuations in interest rates 
the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry has historically been affected by cyclical trends 
demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results and prevailing general economic and market conditions  all of which affect insurance and reinsurance premium rates and the amount of risk that companies and insurers elect to retain 
the supply of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is directly related to the levels of surplus available to support assumed business that  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being realized in the insurance and reinsurance industry  the frequency and severity of losses and prevailing general economic and market conditions 
the cyclical trends in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries and the profitability of these industries can also be significantly affected by volatile and unpredictable developments  including what we believe to be a trend of courts to grant increasingly larger awards for certain types of damages  natural disasters  fluctuations in interest rates  changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of investments and inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by insureds and primary insurance companies 
we cannot predict with accuracy whether market conditions will remain constant  improve or deteriorate 
adverse market conditions may lead to a significant reduction in property and casualty premium rates  less favorable policy terms and or less premium volume 
a downgrade or withdrawal of any of our ratings may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
companies  insurers and reinsurance and insurance intermediaries use financial ratings as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers and reinsurers 
an unfavorable rating or the lack of a rating of its insurer or reinsurer may adversely affect the rating of a company purchasing insurance or reinsurance 
the ratings assigned by rating agencies to insurance and reinsurance companies are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
for the financial strength of each of our principal operating subsidiaries  please see item business our ratings 
to date  none of our ratings issued by an independent rating agency has been downgraded 
however  if an independent rating agency downgrades or withdraws any of our ratings  we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any new insurance and reinsurance contracts  some existing contracts may be terminated  we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted 
a downgrade or withdrawal of any of our ratings by an independent rating agency would significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 

table of contents our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of catastrophes 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected losses resulting from natural and man made catastrophes 
catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events  including hurricanes  earthquakes  hailstorms  severe winter weather  floods  fires  tornadoes  volcano eruptions  explosions  airplane crashes and other natural or man made disasters  including acts of war  terrorism and political risk 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable  but the loss experience of property catastrophe insurers and reinsurers has been generally characterized as low frequency and high severity in nature 
the catastrophe modeling tools that we use to help manage catastrophe exposures are based on assumptions and judgments that rely on historical trends  are subject to error and may produce estimates that are materially different from actual results 
in addition  because accounting regulations do not permit insurers and reinsurers to reserve for catastrophic events until they occur  claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could have a significant and negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
many scientists believe that in recent years changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in some parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures 
for example  in recent years  hurricane activity has affected areas further inland than previously experienced  which has expanded hurricane exposures for insurers and reinsurers 
changing climate conditions could cause catastrophe models to be less accurate  which could limit our ability to effectively manage catastrophe exposures 
competitors and or consolidation in our industry may make it difficult for us to write business effectively and profitably 
the insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
competition in the types of business that we currently underwrite and intend to underwrite in the future is based principally on premium rates  ability to obtain terms and conditions appropriate with the risk being assumed  the general reputation and perceived financial strength of the insurer or reinsurer  relationships with insurance and reinsurance intermediaries  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payment and quality of administrative activities  and experience in the particular line of insurance or reinsurance to be written 
we compete directly with numerous independent insurance and reinsurance companies  captive insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of established and newly formed insurance companies  reinsurance departments of primary insurance companies  government sponsored reinsurance pools and underwriting syndicates from countries throughout the world in our chosen product lines 
many of these competitors are well established  have significant operating histories  underwriting expertise and extensive capital resources and have developed longstanding customer relationships 
our worldwide competitors include many larger companies with higher ratings and greater underwriting capacity than we have 
further  our ability to compete may be harmed if our competitors consolidate 
consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if competitive pressures reduce our prices  we would expect to write less business and net income would decrease 
if our industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring and properly servicing each customer will become greater 
we could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  further reducing our operating margins 
in addition  insurance companies that consolidate may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated  larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance 
the number of companies offering retrocessional reinsurance may decline 
any of the foregoing could significantly and negatively affect our business and our results of operations 
the effect of emerging claim and coverage issues could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as industry practices and legal  judicial and social conditions change  unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
various provisions of our contracts  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  may be difficult to enforce 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond the period that we intended or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until many years after we issue insurance or reinsurance contracts affected by these changes 
as a result  we may not be able to ascertain the full extent of our liabilities under our insurance or reinsurance contracts for many years following the issuance of our contracts 
emerging claims and coverage issues could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents a limited number of insurance and reinsurance brokers account for a large portion of our revenues  and a loss of all or a substantial portion of this brokered business or the consolidation of these brokers could have a significant and negative effect on our business and results of operations 
most of our insurance and reinsurance business is placed through brokers worldwide 
a significant volume of our premiums is produced through a limited number of insurance and reinsurance brokers 
during the years ended december   and  the top three independent producing brokers accounted for  and   and  and  and  respectively  of property and casualty gross premiums written 
insurance and reinsurance brokers may consolidate in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to access business and distribute our products 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided through one or more of these brokers  or the consolidation of these brokers  could have a significant and negative effect on our business and results of operations 
the involvement of reinsurance brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our contracts to reinsurance brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the ceding insurers that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us 
although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of any particular case  in some jurisdictions  if a broker fails to make such a payment  we might remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for these premiums  whether or not we have actually received them 
consequently  consistent with the industry  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers with whom we do business  however  due to the unsettled and fact specific nature of the law  we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk 
to date  we have not experienced any material losses related to these credit risks 
reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance may not be available at all or on acceptable terms  which could adversely impact our ability to write new business or mitigate the effect of large or multiple losses 
we purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance in order to mitigate the effect of large and multiple losses 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
accordingly  we may be unable to obtain desired amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate appropriate or acceptable terms or obtain reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness 
if we fail to obtain reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance at all or on acceptable terms  our capacity to underwrite new business may be limited 
if we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance but are unable to collect  we may have difficulty mitigating the effect of large or multiple losses which  in turn  could have a significant and negative effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more members of our senior management or other key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the efforts of our senior management and other key personnel to implement our business strategy 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our senior management 
under bermuda law  non bermudians  other than spouses of bermudians and holders of permanent resident s certificates or working resident s certificates  may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
a work permit may be granted or renewed only upon showing that  after proper public advertisement  no bermudian  spouse of a bermudian  holder of a permanent resident s certificate or holder of a working resident s certificate meets the minimum standards reasonably required by the employer and has applied for the position 
in addition  the bermuda government limits the term of work permits to six years  subject to certain exemptions for key employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of the members of our senior management or other key personnel  including as a result of our inability to renew the bermudian work permit of such individual  or our inability to hire and retain other senior management and other key personnel  could delay or prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy and  consequently  significantly and negatively affect our business 
the integration of new operations may expose us to operational risks 
over the past several years  we have grown through acquisitions and by expanding our lines of business 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including operational  strategic and financial risks  such as potential liabilities associated with the acquired business 
we may experience difficulties in integrating an acquired company  which could adversely affect the acquired company s performance or prevent us from realizing anticipated synergies  cost savings and operational efficiencies 
our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions 
expanding our lines of business  expanding our geographic reach and entering into joint ventures or partnerships also involve operational  strategic and financial risks  including retaining qualified management and implementing satisfactory budgetary  financial and operational controls 
our failure to manage successfully these risks may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or business or we may not realize any of the intended benefits 

table of contents we may require additional capital and credit in the future  which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all 
we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends 
to the extent that we experience significant losses from our operations or funds generated by our ongoing operations are insufficient to fund our operating expenses  we may need to raise additional capital 
the worldwide financial markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption for the last few years  which may reduce our access to the equity and debt markets and make raising capital on satisfactory terms difficult or impossible 
our access to funds under our existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may fail or may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time 
the banking industry also has experienced significant consolidation in the past few years  which could lead to increased reliance on and exposure to particular institutions 
our inability to obtain adequate capital and credit could have a significant and negative effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could incur substantial losses and reduced liquidity if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations fails 
we maintain cash balances  including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts  significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits at various us depository institutions 
we also maintain cash balances in foreign banks and institutions 
if one or more of these financial institutions fails  our ability to access cash balances might be temporarily or permanently limited  which could have a significant and negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
currency fluctuations could result in exchange losses and our failure to effectively manage our multiple currency assets or liabilities could significantly and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a portion of our investments  insurance and reinsurance liabilities and insurance and reinsurance assets are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
we purchase fixed maturities denominated in the currencies of the relevant insurance and reinsurance liabilities to manage our multiple currency exposures 
we monitor those assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to currency risk  however  mismatches in multiple currency assets and liabilities may give rise to currency losses that could significantly and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we publish our consolidated financial statements in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates used to convert other currencies  particularly the euro and british pound sterling  into us dollars will impact our results of operations and financial condition from year to year 
our failure to maintain sufficient letter of credit facilities or to increase our letter of credit capacity on commercially acceptable terms could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy 
our principal reinsurance operations are conducted by our companies licensed and operated in bermuda  ireland  the united states and the united kingdom 
many jurisdictions do not permit ceding companies to take statutory credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted reinsurers  such as alterra bermuda  alterra europe and alterra re usa  in their statutory financial statements unless appropriate security measures are implemented 
consequently  the majority of our reinsurance clients typically require us to obtain a letter of credit or provide other collateral through funds withheld or trust arrangements 
when we obtain a letter of credit facility  we are required to provide collateral to secure our obligations under the facility 
as of december   we had two us dollar denominated letter of credit facilities totaling  million with an additional million available subject to certain conditions 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities 
we had a british pound sterling denominated letter of credit facility of gbp million million to support our london branch of alterra europe  of which gbp million million was utilized as of december  we also had a british pound sterling denominated letter of credit facility of gbp million million to support our funds at lloyd s commitments  which was not utilized as of december  our failure to maintain our letter of credit facilities or to increase our letter of credit capacity on commercially acceptable terms when necessary could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including the seasonality of the insurance and reinsurance business  the volume and mix of insurance and reinsurance products that we write  loss experience on our insurance and reinsurance contracts  the performance of our investment portfolio and our ability to assess and integrate our risk management strategy effectively 
in particular  we seek to underwrite business and make investments to achieve long term results 
as a result  our short term results of operations may not be indicative of our long term prospects 

table of contents we are a holding company that depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends 
alterra is a holding company and does not have any significant operations or assets other than its ownership of the shares of its subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our subsidiaries are our primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including future debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
some of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions that limit their ability to declare and pay dividends 
in addition  certain of alterra bermuda s credit facilities prohibit alterra bermuda from paying dividends at any time that alterra s shareholders equity or alterra bermuda s shareholders equity is less than a specified amount  as well as in certain other circumstances 
the inability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have an adverse effect on our operations and our ability meet our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the payment of dividends and making of distributions by bermuda legal entities are limited under bermuda law 
alterra bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends if it is in breach of its enhanced capital requirement  solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach 
where an insurer fails to meet its solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year  it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the bermuda monetary authority  or bma 
further  alterra bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus unless it files with the bma an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio 
alterra bermuda must obtain the bma s prior approval for a reduction by or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year s financial statements 
in addition  as a long term insurer  alterra bermuda may not declare or pay a dividend to any person other than a policyholder unless the value of the assets in its long term business fund exceeds the liabilities of the insurer s long term business by the amount of the dividend and at least the prescribed minimum solvency margin 
our failure to comply with covenants contained in our indentures or our credit facilities could trigger prepayment obligations  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently guarantee the senior notes issued by certain of our subsidiaries 
the indentures governing those senior notes contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to  among other things  the incurrence of liens and the disposition of capital stock of these subsidiaries 
in addition  each of our credit facilities requires us and or certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain covenants  including the maintenance of a minimum consolidated net tangible worth and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the indentures or credit facilities  which could result in us being required to repay the notes or any amounts outstanding under these facilities prior to maturity 
these prepayment obligations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our investments changes in market interest rates and general economic conditions could have a significant and negative effect on our investment portfolio  investment income and results of operations 
our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio 
our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations 
increasing market interest rates reduce the value of our fixed maturities  and we may realize a loss if we sell fixed maturities whose value has fallen below their acquisition cost 
declining market interest rates can have the effect of reducing our investment income  as we invest proceeds from positive cash flows from operations and reinvest proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that may yield less than our investment portfolio s average rate of return 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
we attempt to mitigate interest rate risk by monitoring the duration and structure of our investment portfolio relative to the duration and structure of our liability portfolio  however  our estimates of the duration and structure of our liability portfolio may be inaccurate and we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover the liability 
any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity 
accordingly  changes in interest rates could have a significant and negative effect on our investment portfolio  financial condition and results of operations 
disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in large financial institutions  could result in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
depending on market conditions  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have a significant and negative effect on our investment portfolio  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents unexpected volatility or illiquidity associated with our fixed maturities investment portfolio could significantly and negatively affect our investment portfolio  results of operations and financial condition 
our fixed maturities portfolio investment strategy requires a minimum weighted average credit quality rating of aa aa  or its equivalent  from at least one internationally recognized statistical rating organization 
market conditions and other factors beyond our control could cause the credit quality rating of our investments to deteriorate 
deterioration of credit ratings on our fixed maturities investments may result in the need to liquidate these securities in the financial markets 
if we are required to liquidate these securities during a period of tightening credit in the financial markets  we may realize a significant loss 
in addition  our fixed maturities portfolio includes below investment grade and unrated securities that have a greater risk of default than higher rated securities 
our fixed maturities portfolio includes mortgage backed and asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
these types of securities have cash flows that are backed by the principal and interest payments of a group of underlying mortgages or other receivables 
as a result of the increasing default rates of borrowers  there is a greater risk of default on mortgage backed and asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations than historically existed  especially those that are non investment grade 
these factors make the estimate of fair value more uncertain 
we obtain fair value estimates from multiple independent pricing sources to corroborate the fair value we record and in an effort to mitigate some of the uncertainty surrounding the fair value estimates 
if we need to liquidate these securities within a short period of time  the actual realized proceeds may be significantly different from the fair values estimated at december  the financial crisis in europe  including the threat of default on european sovereign debt  the devaluation of the euro and the dissolution of the european union  could adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
a number of european union member states  namely greece  ireland  italy  portugal and spain  have recently undertaken financial restructuring efforts in order to avoid insolvency and default on their sovereign debt 
the failure of these restructuring efforts could have an adverse effect on the portion of our investment portfolio held in sovereign debt issued by european union members 
furthermore  the failure of the european union member states to successfully resolve this crisis could result in the devaluation of the euro 
in addition to european sovereign debt  we have other assets in our investment portfolio that are euro denominated 
as of december    million million of our invested assets were denominated in euros 
a devaluation of the euro could lead to a significant decline in the value of these assets 
it is possible that this financial crisis may lead to the abandonment of the euro by one or more members of the european union or the dissolution of the european union 
the european union member states have implemented a regulatory scheme that facilitates our ability to operate across europe 
the dissolution of the european union and the absence of this regulatory scheme could negatively affect our ability to operate across europe 
it is impossible to predict all of the consequences that the potential default by european union member states on sovereign debt  the devaluation or abandonment of the euro or the dissolution of the european union may have on the global economy in general or more specifically on our business 
any or all of these events could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the determination of the impairments taken on our investments is subjective and could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the determination of the impairments taken on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
we cannot assure you that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future  which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
our valuation of fixed maturity securities and hedge fund investments include methodologies  estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fixed maturity and hedge fund investments  which are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets 
fair value prices for all securities in the fixed maturities portfolio are independently provided by our investment custodians  investment accounting service provider and investment managers  which each utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services 
we record the unadjusted price provided by our primary pricing source  which may be the investment custodian or the investment accounting service provider  after an internal validation process 

table of contents investments in hedge funds comprise a portfolio of limited partnerships and stock investments in trading entities  or funds  which invest in a wide range of financial products 
the units of account that are fair valued are our interest in the funds and not the underlying holdings of such funds 
as a result  the inputs we use to value our investment in each of the funds may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of such funds 
these funds are stated at fair value  which ordinarily will be the most recently reported net asset value as advised by the fund manager or administrator  where the funds underlying holdings can be in various quoted and unquoted investments 
during periods of market disruption  including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities  such as mortgage backed securities  if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable 
in addition  there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to changes in the financial environment 
in such cases  more securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment 
as a result  valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated or require greater estimation thereby resulting in values that may be less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold 
further  rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value may have a significant and negative effect on our investment portfolio  financial condition and results of operations 
unexpected volatility or illiquidity associated with our hedge fund investment portfolio could significantly and negatively affect our ability to conduct business 
as of december   we had reduced our allocation to hedge fund investments to approximately of total invested assets  although our investment guidelines permit us to invest up to of our investment portfolio in alternative investments  including hedge funds 
we invest in various hedge funds  which follow investment strategies that involve investing in a broad range of investments  some of which may be volatile 
the risks associated with our hedge fund investment portfolio may be substantially greater than the risks associated with fixed maturities investments 
further  because many of the hedge funds in which we invest impose limitations on the timing of withdrawals  or may suspend withdrawals for a period of time  we may be unable to withdraw our investment from a particular hedge fund on a timely basis 
unexpected volatility or illiquidity associated with our hedge fund investment portfolio could significantly and negatively affect our ability to conduct business 
the failure of our investment managers to perform their services effectively could significantly and negatively affect our ability to conduct business 
we have entered into investment management agreements with a number of managers to manage our aggregate fixed maturities portfolio 
additionally  each underlying hedge fund manager for our hedge fund investment portfolio has discretionary authority over the portion of our underlying hedge fund investment portfolio that it manages 
as a result  the aggregate performance of our investment portfolio depends to a significant extent on the ability of our investment managers  and the investment managers of each underlying hedge fund  to select and manage appropriate investments 
the failure of these investment managers to perform their services in a manner consistent with our expectations and investment objectives could significantly and negatively affect our ability to conduct our business 
risks related to regulation of our company the regulatory systems under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a significant and negative effect on our business 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate in numerous countries around the world as well as in all us states 
the insurance and reinsurance industry is generally heavily regulated  and our operations in each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision 
the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require these companies to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital  surplus and liquidity  meet solvency standards  submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition and restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries also are subject to laws and regulations that may restrict the ability of these companies to write insurance and reinsurance policies  make certain investments and distribute funds 
in recent years  the insurance regulatory environment has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions 
in july  the us government passed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  one of the most sweeping financial reforms in decades 
the legislation is expected to affect virtually every segment of the financial services industry  including the insurance and reinsurance industry in the united states 
among other things  the dodd frank act created the federal insurance office to be located within the us treasury department  with the authority to monitor nearly all aspects of the insurance industry and change the regulatory framework for non admitted insurance and reinsurance 
in april  the european union parliament adopted the solvency ii directive  which enhances the capital and solvency framework applicable to insurance and 
table of contents reinsurance companies 
when this regulation becomes effective  we expect that it will substantially increase the level of regulation on our european operations  including alterra europe and alterra at lloyd s 
in an effort to achieve equivalency with the solvency ii directive  the bma has recently enacted regulations that will enhance the capital and solvency framework to ensure that insurers maintain adequate capital and liquidity levels proportionate to the insurer s risk profile and require additional financial and other disclosure 
we expect that this regulation will substantially increase the level of regulation on alterra bermuda 
the bma also is enacting a group solvency framework that could enhance the required capital and solvency of the company as a whole 
in addition  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  which is the organization of insurance regulators from the us states  the district of columbia and the four us territories  as well as state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations 
the cost of compliance with existing laws and regulations is expensive  and the costs of compliance with any new legal requirements could have a significant and negative effect on our business 
we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain desired exemptions from  new laws and regulations that govern the conduct of our business 
failure to comply with  or to obtain desired authorizations and or exemptions under  any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject  or in the interpretations thereof by enforcement or regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
certain of our subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements  and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action 
all of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements 
in the united states  our insurance and reinsurance operating companies are subject to risk based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed by state laws 
the risk based capital standards  or rbc standards  are based upon the risk based capital model act adopted by the naic 
alterra bermuda is subject to risk based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed by the bma 
alterra europe is required to maintain statutory reserves  particularly in respect of underwriting liabilities  and a solvency margin as provided for under irish law 
alterra at lloyd s underwriting activities are regulated by the fsa as well as being subject to the lloyd s franchise 
lloyd s approves annually the business plan of each of the syndicates along with any subsequent material changes  and the amount of capital required to support those plans 
the fsa requires that the managing agent of the syndicates carry out a capital assessment of the syndicates in order to determine whether any additional capital should be held by the syndicates on account of any particular risks arising from its business or operational infrastructure 
additionally  lloyd s insurance and reinsurance business is subject to local regulation 
regulators in the united states require lloyd s to maintain certain minimum deposits in trust funds as protection for policyholders in the united states 
the fsa requires lloyd s to satisfy an annual solvency test and to maintain solvency on a continuous basis 
the solvency position of each member  and of lloyd s as a whole  is monitored on a regular basis 
any failure to meet applicable requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further examination or corrective action by regulators  including limitations on our writing additional business or engaging in finance activities  supervision or liquidation 
further  any changes in existing risk based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase our statutory capital levels  which we might be unable to do 
political  regulatory and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to substantial scrutiny by governmental authorities worldwide 
regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders 
increasingly  governmental authorities seem to be interested in the potential systemic risks posed by the insurance and reinsurance industry as a whole 
we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  however  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future and these initiatives could adversely affect our business 
for example  we could be adversely affected by proposals that provide insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target  require our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations  increasingly mandate the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies  establish a new federal insurance regulator or financial industry systemic risk regulator  revise tax laws  including a potential change to us tax laws to disallow or limit the current tax deductions for reinsurance premiums paid by our us subsidiaries to our bermuda subsidiary for reinsurance it provides to our us subsidiaries  or disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of another 

table of contents changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments  particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income  shareholders equity and other relevant financial statement line items 
in particular  recent guidance and ongoing projects put in place by standard setters globally have indicated a possible move away from the current insurance accounting models toward more fair value based models  which could introduce significant volatility in the earnings of insurance industry participants 
furthermore  rules relating to certain accounting practices in the insurance and reinsurance industry are currently being reviewed by applicable regulatory bodies and any changes required by that review could have a material effect on the reported operating results and financial condition of the industry or particular market participants 
risks related to our common shares our common shares are subject to limitations on transfer and voting rights and rights of repurchase 
under our bye laws  our board of directors is authorized to decline to register any transfer of our common shares if they determine that such transfer would result in adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us or any shareholder or if such transfer would result in any us shareholder owning  directly or indirectly  or more of our common shares 
in addition  under our bye laws  if our board of directors determines that ownership of any of our common shares may result in adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us or any shareholder or if such ownership would result in any us shareholder owning  directly or indirectly  or more of our common shares  we may repurchase the common shares 
we are authorized to request information from any holder or prospective acquirer of our common shares as necessary to effect registration of any such transaction and may decline to register any such transaction if complete and accurate information is not received as requested 
in addition  our bye laws generally provide that any us shareholder owning  directly or by attribution  or more of our common shares will have the voting rights attached to such common shares reduced such that the common shares will constitute less than of the voting power of all of our common shares 
because of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  this requirement may have the effect of reducing the voting rights of a shareholder whether or not that shareholder directly holds of record or more of our common shares 
furthermore  our board of directors has the authority to request from any shareholder certain information for the purpose of determining whether that shareholder s voting rights are to be reduced 
failure to respond to such a notice  or submitting incomplete or inaccurate information  gives the board of directors discretion to disregard all votes attached to such shareholder s common shares 
us persons who own our common shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than us persons who are shareholders of a us corporation 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda 
however  the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong done to a company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of a company  is illegal or would result in the violation of our memorandum of association or bye laws 
furthermore  consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with such action 
our bye laws provide that shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have  individually or in the right of the company  against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of such director s or officer s duties  except with respect to any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer 
class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders under delaware law for  among other things  breach of fiduciary duty  corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law 
in such actions  the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover attorneys fees incurred in connection with such action 
anti takeover provisions contained in our bye laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our management or delay or prevent the sale of our company  which could diminish the value of our common shares 
our bye laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in our management or a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
for example  they may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
for example  provisions in our bye laws that could delay or prevent a change in management or change in control include the board is permitted to issue preferred shares and to fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders  
table of contents shareholders have limited ability to remove directors  in order to nominate directors at shareholder meetings  shareholders must own a minimum percentage of our common shares  provide advance notice and furnish certain information with respect to the nominee and any other information as may be reasonably required by the company  the total voting power of any us shareholder owning or more of our common shares is automatically reduced to less than of the total voting power of our capital stock  if the board determines that the ownership of our common shares by any person may result in adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  our subsidiaries or any shareholder  then the board may  in its discretion and on behalf of the company  purchase or assign the right to purchase all or a part of the common shares held by such person at fair market value as defined in our bye laws  and the board  in its absolute discretion  may decline to register a transfer of common shares if it has reason to believe that the effect of the transfer would be to increase the total number of common shares owned by any person to or higher  that the transfer may expose us  any subsidiary or any shareholder to adverse tax or regulatory treatment or that the registration of the transfer under any federal or state securities law or under the laws of any other jurisdiction is required and the registration has not yet been effected 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer  the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the acquirer  the integrity and management of the acquiror s board of directors and executive officers  the acquirer s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurers and any anti competitive results that many arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
because a person acquiring or more of our common shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our us subsidiaries  the insurance change of control laws of connecticut and delaware would likely apply to such a transaction 
under the delaware and connecticut insurance holding company system laws  acquiring or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or any of its parent companies is presumptively considered a change of control  although such presumption may be rebutted 
accordingly  any person who acquires  directly or indirectly  or more of the voting securities of alterra without the prior approval of the delaware and or connecticut insurance commissioner  will be in violation of these laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the applicable state insurance commissioner 
in addition  many us state insurance laws require prior notification of state insurance departments of a change in control of a non domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state 
while these pre notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove a change of control  they authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration 
any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of alterra may require prior notification in those us states that have adopted pre acquisition notification laws 
anyone acquiring or disposing of a direct or indirect holding in an irish authorized insurance company that represents or more of the capital or of the voting rights of such company or that makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of such company  or anyone who proposed to decrease or increase that holding to specified levels  must first notify the irish regulatory authority of their intention to do so 
any irish authorized insurance company that becomes aware of any acquisitions or disposal of its capital involving the specified levels must also notify the irish regulatory authority 
the specified levels are  and or such other level or ownership that results in the company becoming the acquirer s subsidiary 
the irish regulatory authority has three months from the date of submission of a notification within which to oppose the proposed transaction if the irish regulatory authority is not satisfied as to the suitability of the acquirer in view of the necessity to ensure prudent and sound management of the insurance undertaking concerned 
any person who becomes a holder of at least   or of a bermuda insurance company must notify the bma in writing within days of becoming such a holder 
the bma has the power to object to a person holding or more of a bermuda insurance company if it determines that the person is not fit and proper 
in such a case  the bma may require the holder to reduce their shareholding and may direct  among other things  that holder may not exercise their voting rights in the company 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  including transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable 

table of contents investors may have difficulty effecting service of process on us or enforcing judgments against us in the united states 
we are incorporated pursuant to the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda 
in addition  certain of our directors and officers reside outside the united states  and a significant portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
accordingly  we have been advised that there is doubt as to whether a holder of our common shares would be able to enforce  in the courts of bermuda  judgments of us courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws  a holder of our common shares would be able to bring an original action in the bermuda courts to enforce liabilities against us or our directors and officers who reside outside the united states  based solely upon us federal securities laws 
we have also been advised that there is no treaty in effect between the united states and bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of us courts and there are grounds upon which bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of us courts 
furthermore  certain remedies available under us federal and state laws  including us federal securities laws  may not be available under bermuda law 
because judgments of us courts are not automatically enforceable in bermuda  it may be difficult for shareholders to recover against us based upon such judgments 
certain of our shareholders and directors may have conflicts of interest 
certain of our shareholders and directors hold positions  engage in commercial activities and enter into transactions or agreements with us or in competition with us  which may give rise to conflicts of interest 
certain of our directors have sponsored  and may in the future sponsor  other entities engaged in or intending to engage in insurance and reinsurance underwriting  some of which compete or may in the future compete with us 
they have also entered into or may in the future enter into agreements with companies that compete or may in the future compete with us 
we do not have any agreement or understanding with any of these parties regarding the resolution of potential conflicts of interest 
we may not be in a position to influence any party s decision to engage in activities that would give rise to a conflict of interest 
future issuances of common shares may cause the market price of our common shares to decline 
as of december   we had  common shares outstanding 
in addition   common shares are issuable under currently outstanding stock options and warrants granted to employees and certain of our founders 
in the future  we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions 
the issuance of substantial amounts of our common shares could cause dilution to our shareholders and could adversely affect the price of our common shares 
risks related to taxation alterra and its non us subsidiaries may be subject to non us federal income taxation 
if alterra or any of our non us subsidiaries were treated as engaged in a trade or business in the united states  that entity could be subject to us income and branch profits tax on all or a portion of the income that is effectively connected with such trade or business 
we intend to operate in a manner such that neither alterra nor any of our non us subsidiaries with certain limited exceptions will be treated as being engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
accordingly  we do not believe that alterra or any of such non us subsidiaries are or will be subject to us federal income taxation on net income 
however  this determination is essentially factual in nature  and there are no definitive standards provided by the internal revenue code  regulations or court decisions as to what activities constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the us internal revenue service  or irs  would not find that alterra or any of such non us subsidiaries is engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
any such income or branch profits tax could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
even if alterra and such non us subsidiaries are not treated as being engaged in a trade or business in the united states  we may be subject to us federal income tax on certain fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains  profits and income such as dividends and certain interest on investments derived from sources within the united states 
in addition  we are subject to a us excise tax that is imposed on reinsurance and insurance premiums received with respect to risks or insureds located in the united states 
we might experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations if companies in our group that are incorporated outside a relevant jurisdiction are determined to be carrying on a trade or business there 
although we operate globally  we intend to operate in such a manner that other than in limited exceptions our companies will not be considered resident for tax purposes or be deemed to have a permanent establishment in jurisdictions other than those of their formation 
nevertheless  tax rules and interpretations are uncertain and the operations of these companies often involve activities in 
table of contents higher tax jurisdictions 
as a result  the taxing authorities in those jurisdictions may assert that the activities of one or more of these companies creates a sufficient nexus in that jurisdiction to subject the company to income and other taxes in that jurisdiction 
accordingly  we could incur substantial unexpected tax liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
shareholders who are us persons may recognize income for us federal income tax purposes on our undistributed earnings 
shareholders who are us persons may recognize income for us federal income tax purposes on our undistributed earnings if we are treated as a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign corporation or if we have generated more than a permissible amount of related person insurance income 
in addition  gain on the disposition of our common shares may be treated as dividend income 
passive foreign investment company 
in order to avoid significant potential adverse us federal income tax consequences for any us person who owns our common shares  we must not constitute a passive foreign investment company in any year in which such us person is a shareholder 
those consequences could include increasing the tax liability of the investor  accelerating the imposition of the tax and causing a loss of the basis step up on the death of the investor 
in general  a non us corporation is a passive foreign investment company for a taxable year if or more of its income constitutes passive income or or more of its assets produce passive income 
passive income generally includes interest  dividends and other investment income 
however  passive income does not include income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a company that is predominantly engaged in an insurance business 
this exception is intended to ensure that income derived by a bona fide insurance company is not treated as passive income  except to the extent such income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the insurance business 
currently  we do not believe that we maintain financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of our insurance business 
if  because of a change in the business plan or for any other reason  we maintain excess financial reserves  we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company 
although alterra s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as the insurance subsidiaries  expect to engage predominantly in insurance activities that involve significant risk transfer and do not expect to have financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of their insurance businesses  we could nonetheless be deemed to be a passive foreign investment company 
we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company if any insurance subsidiary engages in certain non traditional insurance activities that do not involve sufficient transfer of risk or if any company maintains financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of its respective insurance business 
in addition  there may be other circumstances that may cause us not to satisfy the exception for insurance companies 
for example  the irs may disagree with our interpretation of the current scope of the active insurance company exception and successfully challenge our position that we qualify for the exception 
in addition  the irs may issue regulatory or other guidance that applies on either a prospective or retroactive basis under which we may fail to qualify for the active insurance company exception 
while we do not believe that we are or will be a passive foreign investment company  we cannot assure shareholders that the irs or a court will concur that we are not a passive foreign investment company with respect to any given year 
if we were treated as a passive foreign investment company  the availability of the mark to market election is uncertain for shareholders who are us persons 
this election may under certain circumstances mitigate the negative tax consequences of an investment in a passive foreign investment company 
controlled foreign corporation 
each us person who  directly  indirectly  or through attribution rules  owns or more of our common shares should consider the possible application of the controlled foreign corporation rules 
each us shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation on the last day of the controlled foreign corporation s taxable year generally must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the controlled foreign corporation s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income has not been distributed 
in general  a non us insurance company is treated as a controlled foreign corporation only if such us shareholders collectively own more than of the total combined voting power or total value of the company s capital stock for an uninterrupted period of days or more during any year 
we believe that  because of the dispersion of share ownership among our shareholders and because of the restrictions in our bye laws on ownership of our common shares  shareholders will not be subject to treatment as us shareholders of a controlled foreign corporation 
in addition  because under our bye laws no single shareholder is permitted to exercise or more of the total combined voting power  we believe that our shareholders should not be viewed as us shareholders of a controlled foreign corporation for purposes of the controlled foreign corporation rules 
we cannot assure shareholders  however  that these rules will not apply to our shareholders 
related person insurance income 
if any insurance subsidiary s related person insurance income determined on a gross basis were to equal or exceed of its gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds were directly or indirectly to own more than of the voting power or value of such insurance subsidiary s capital stock  then a us person who owns our common shares directly or indirectly on the last day of the taxable year most likely would be required to include in income for us federal income tax purposes the us person s pro rata share of such insurance subsidiary s related person insurance income for the taxable year  determined as if such related person insurance income were distributed proportionately to such us person at that date 
related person insurance income is generally underwriting profits and related investment income attributable to insurance or reinsurance policies where the direct or indirect insureds are direct or indirect us shareholders or are related to such direct or indirect us shareholders 
we do not expect any insurance subsidiary will knowingly 
table of contents enter into insurance or reinsurance agreements in which  in the aggregate  the direct or indirect insureds are  or are related to  owners of or more of our common shares 
currently  we do not believe that the gross insurance income threshold has been met 
however  we cannot assure shareholders that this is or will continue to be the case 
consequently  we cannot assure shareholders that a person who is a direct or indirect us shareholder will not be required to include amounts in its income in respect of related person insurance income in any taxable year 
if a us shareholder is treated as disposing of shares in a us insurance corporation that has related person insurance income and in which us persons own or more of the voting power or value of the company s capital stock  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as dividend income to the extent of the us shareholder s portion of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the us shareholder owned the shares 
in addition  such a shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the direct or indirect us shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of our common shares because alterra is not itself directly engaged in the insurance business and because proposed us treasury regulations applicable to this situation appear to apply only in the case of shares of corporations that are directly engaged in the insurance business 
we cannot assure shareholders  however  that the irs will interpret the proposed regulations in this manner or that the proposed regulations will not be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our common shares 
us tax exempt organizations who own our common shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income 
a us tax exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of our subpart f insurance income is allocated to the organization 
in general  subpart f insurance income will be allocated to a us tax exempt organization if either we are a controlled foreign corporation and the tax exempt shareholder is a us shareholder or there is related person insurance income and certain exceptions do not apply 
although we do not believe that any us persons will be allocated subpart f insurance income  we cannot assure shareholders that this will be the case 
changes in us tax laws or new us tax laws could subject us and or us persons who own our common shares to us income taxation on our undistributed earnings 
the tax laws and interpretations regarding whether a company is engaged in a us trade or business  is a passive foreign investment company  is a controlled foreign corporation  or has related party insurance income are subject to change  possibly on a retroactive basis 
it is possible that the irs may issue new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules 
we are not able to predict if  when or in what form any such guidance will be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect 
in addition  the irs may issue tax rules and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which would have a significant and negative effect on our business and results of operations 
under current bermuda law  there is no income  corporate  profits  withholding  capital gains or capital transfer tax payable by alterra or its bermuda based subsidiaries 
each of these entities has obtained from the minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  an assurance that  in the event that bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits  income  any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance  then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to any of these entities  their operations or their shares  debentures or other obligations  until march  given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any bermuda taxes after march  our business and results of operations would be significantly and negatively affected if we were to become subject to taxes in bermuda 
the impact of bermuda s commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
according to the oecd  bermuda is a jurisdiction that has substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard and as such is listed on the oecd white list 
however  we are not able to predict whether any changes will be made to this classification or whether any such changes will subject us to additional taxes

two lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia name alterra bermuda  along with approximately other insurance companies and brokers  as a defendant 
the claims in each case are that the defendants conspired to manipulate bidding practices for insurance policies in certain insurance lines and failed to disclose certain commission arrangements 
the first of these cases was filed on april  by new cingular wireless headquarter llc and other corporations 
the complaint asserts statutory claims under the sherman antitrust act  the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act  the antitrust laws of several states  as well as common law claims alleging breach of fiduciary duty and fraud

key performance indicators the financial measures that we believe are most meaningful in analyzing our performance and assessing whether we are achieving our objectives are growth in book value per share  net operating income  combined ratio  return on average shareholders equity and net operating return on average shareholders equity

net operating income and net operating return on average shareholders equity are non gaap financial measures as defined by sec regulation g 
see non gaap financial measures for reconciliation to the nearest us gaap financial measure 
combined ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned for property and casualty business 
return on average shareholders equity and net operating return on average shareholders equity are calculated by dividing net income and net operating income  respectively  by average shareholders equity determined using the average of the quarterly average shareholders equity balances for the year 
we consider growth in book value per share to be the most important financial performance measure in assessing whether we are meeting our business objectives 
during the year ended december   our book value per share on a basic and diluted basis increased by and  respectively 
we also distributed per share in cash to our shareholders  which provided tangible value to shareholders and reduced our excess capital 
we believe that a comparison of book value per share and diluted book value per share from december  to december  should be adjusted for these distributions to fully reflect the return generated for shareholders 
adding back per share to our december  diluted book value per share of would result in per share  an increase of over december  the increase in diluted book value per share  as adjusted  was principally due to a combination of positive operating results  unrealized gains on our investment portfolio and share repurchases at a discount to diluted book value per share 
property catastrophe losses resulting from natural disasters in thailand in the fourth quarter  in the united states in the second and third quarters  and in japan  new zealand and australia in the first quarter  had a significant effect on our results of operations for the year ended december  we incurred losses from these events of million  net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums  for the year ended december  these events are currently estimated to have caused industry losses exceeding billion dollars  however  our strategy of diversified underwriting and a measured catastrophe risk appetite resulted in what we believe was a manageable level of property catastrophe losses and limited the capital impact to of our shareholders equity as of december  we seek to manage and monitor our exposure so that the estimated maximum impact of a catastrophic event in any geographic zone is less than of our beginning of year shareholders equity for a modeled in year event 
as of december   our aggregate exposure was below this target 
we continue to monitor the pricing environment and believe we have the capital and operational flexibility to adjust our aggregate exposure should market conditions change over the course of despite the incurred losses from catastrophe events  our net operating income was million for the year ended december   with a combined ratio of 
the catastrophe losses principally affected our reinsurance and alterra at lloyd s segments 
our reinsurance segment still reported positive underwriting income for the year ended december  net favorable development on prior year loss reserves was million for the year ended december   reducing the combined ratio by percentage points 
the net favorable development was principally in our insurance and reinsurance segments 

table of contents we continued to actively manage our capital during the year by taking advantage of select opportunities to purchase our common shares in the market 
we spent million to repurchase million shares during the year at an average price of per share  a discount to our december  diluted book value per share 
as of december   our remaining share repurchase authorization was million 
subsequently  on february   our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by million 
we expect to continue to consider share repurchases as an effective tool to manage capital in a soft cycle and to increase book value per share for our shareholders 
we target a long term net operating roe of the risk free rate plus over the cycle 
for the year ended december   our net operating roe and return on average shareholders equity fell short of our target primarily due to the significant property catastrophe event losses in the year and historically low fixed income investment yields 
the markets in which we operate historically have been cyclical 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms for insurers and reinsurers 
during periods of reduced underwriting capacity  pricing and policy terms are generally more favorable for insurers and reinsurers 
we believe that the industry has been in a period of excess underwriting capacity  and while s property catastrophe events likely eroded some of that capacity  there was not sufficient pressure on the industry to improve pricing in the industry is also operating in a low interest rate environment  which makes it more difficult to generate significant investment income growth 
both of these factors generally result in lower net operating income  return on average shareholders equity and net operating return on average shareholders equity 
although there remains uncertainty regarding the timing  location and scale of a favorable turn in the market  we believe that the industry is showing signs of improvement for however  we intend to maintain our underwriting discipline while actively managing our expenses 
we expect our gross written premiums for the year ending december  to be consistent with the year ended december   and we expect to write more premiums in our short tail lines of business than our long tail casualty lines of business 
drivers of profitability revenues we derive operating revenues from premiums from our insurance and reinsurance businesses 
additionally  we recognize returns from our investment portfolios 
insurance and reinsurance premiums are a function of the amount and type of contracts written as well as prevailing market prices and conditions 
property and casualty premiums are earned over the terms of the underlying coverage 
life and annuity reinsurance premiums are generally earned when the premium is due from policyholders 
each of our insurance and reinsurance contracts contain different pricing  terms and conditions and expected profit margins 
therefore  the amount of premiums is not necessarily an accurate indicator of our anticipated profitability 
premium estimates are based upon information in underlying contracts  data received from clients and from premium audits 
changes in premium estimates are expected and may result in significant adjustments in any period 
these estimates change over time as additional information regarding the underlying business volume of our clients is obtained 
there is often a delay in the receipt of updated premium information from clients due to the time lag in preparing and reporting the data to us 
after review by our underwriters and finance staff  we increase or decrease premium estimates as updated information from our clients is received 
our net investment income is a function of the average invested assets and the average yield that we earn on those invested assets 
the investment yield on our fixed maturities investments is a function of market interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of our fixed maturities portfolio 
our net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments includes realized gains and losses on our fixed maturity securities and changes in fair value of our trading securities and other investments 
we recognize the realized gains and losses at the time of sale  and they  along with the changes in fair value of our trading securities  reflect the results of changing market values and conditions  including changes in market interest rates and changes in the market s perception of the credit quality of our fixed maturities holdings 
the change in fair value of other investments is principally a function of the success of the funds in which we are invested  which depends on  among other things  the underlying strategies of the funds  the ability of the fund managers to execute the fund strategies and general economic and investment market conditions 
expenses our principal expenses are losses and benefits  acquisition costs  interest expense and general and administrative expenses 
losses and benefits are based on the amount and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts written by us during the current reporting 
table of contents period and information received during the current reporting period from clients pertaining to contracts written in prior years 
we record losses and benefits based on actuarial estimates of the expected losses and benefits to be incurred on each contract written 
the ultimate losses and benefits depend on the actual costs to settle these liabilities 
we increase or decrease losses and benefits estimates as actual claim reports are received 
our ability to make reasonable estimates of losses and benefits at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining profitability 
acquisition costs consist principally of ceding commissions paid to ceding clients and brokerage expenses 
these typically represent a negotiated percentage of the premiums on insurance and reinsurance contracts written 
acquisition costs are stated net of ceding commissions associated with premiums ceded to our quota share partners on our insurance and reinsurance business 
these ceding commissions are designed to compensate us for the costs of producing the portfolio of risks ceded to our reinsurers 
we defer and amortize these costs over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
interest expense principally reflects interest on any bank loans and interest on our senior notes 
interest expense also includes the net interest charge on funds withheld from reinsurers under reinsurance and retrocessional contracts 
interest expense on funds withheld from other reinsurers under reinsurance and retrocessional contracts will vary principally due to changes in the balance of funds withheld 
in addition  interest expense also includes interest on deposit contracts 
general and administrative expenses are principally employee salaries  incentive compensation and related personnel costs  office rent  amortization of leasehold improvements  information technology expenditures and other operating costs 
these costs generally do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserve for property and casualty losses the liability for property and casualty losses is the largest and most complex estimate in our consolidated balance sheet 
the liability for losses  including loss adjustment expenses  represents estimates of the ultimate cost of all losses incurred but not paid as of the balance sheet date 
the reserves are estimated on an undiscounted basis 
we utilize a variety of standard actuarial methods to estimate our reserves 
although these actuarial methods have been developed over time  assumptions about anticipated size of loss and loss emergence patterns are subject to fluctuations 
we review our estimate of reserves on a quarterly basis and consider all significant facts and circumstances then known 
newly reported loss information from clients or insureds is the principal contributor to adjustments to our loss reserve estimates 
these adjustments are recognized in the period in which they are determined  and therefore can impact that period s results either favorably when reserve estimates established in prior periods prove to be redundant or adversely when reserve estimates established in prior periods prove to be deficient 
we categorize our loss reserves into two types case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves  or ibnr 
the table below shows our reserves as of december  and by type and by segment 
as of december  as of december  case ibnr total case ibnr total in millions of us dollars insurance casualty property reinsurance casualty property us specialty casualty 
table of contents property alterra at lloyd s casualty property total casualty property total case reserves 
case reserves are established for individual claims that have been reported to us or  in the case of reinsurance  have been reported by our cedants 
for our insurance operations  we are generally notified of insured losses by our insureds and or their brokers 
based on this information  we establish case reserves by estimating the expected ultimate losses from the claim including any administrative costs associated with settling the claim 
our claims personnel use their knowledge of the specific claim along with internal and external experts  including underwriters  actuaries and legal counsel  to estimate the expected ultimate losses 
for our reinsurance operations  case reserves are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies and or their brokers 
for excess of loss contracts  we are typically notified of insurance losses on specific contracts and record a case reserve for the estimated expected ultimate losses from the claim 
for proportional contracts  we typically receive aggregated claims information and record a case reserve based on that information 
as with insurance business  we evaluate this information and estimate the expected ultimate losses 
ibnr 
ibnr reserves are reserves that are statistically estimated for losses that have occurred but not yet been reported to us 
consistent with industry practice  we utilize a variety of standard actuarial methods together with management judgment to estimate ibnr 
the loss reserve selection from these methods is based on the loss development characteristics of the specific line of business and contracts  which take into consideration coverage terms  type of business  maturity of loss data  reported claims and paid claims 
we do not necessarily utilize the same actuarial method or group of actuarial methods for all contracts within a line of business or segment as variations between contracts result in a number of different methods or groups of methods being appropriate 
there is normally a time lag between when a loss event occurs and when it is actually reported to us 
these actuarial methods that we use to estimate losses have been designed to address the lag in loss reporting as well as the delay in obtaining information that would allow us to more accurately estimate future payments 
there is also often a time lag between reinsurance clients establishing case reserves and re estimating their reserves  and notifying us of the new or revised case reserves 
as a result  reporting lag is more pronounced in our reinsurance contracts than in our insurance contracts due to the reliance on insurers to report their claims to us 
on reinsurance transactions  the reporting lag will generally be to days after the end of a reporting period  but can be longer in some cases 
based on the experience of our actuaries and management  we select loss development factors and trending techniques to mitigate the problems caused by reporting lags 
we regularly evaluate and update our loss development and trending factor selections using client specific and industry data 
the principal actuarial methods we use to perform our quarterly loss reserve analysis may include one or more of the following methods initial expected loss ratio method 
to estimate ultimate losses under the expected loss ratio method  we multiply earned premiums by an expected loss ratio 
the expected loss ratio is selected utilizing industry data  historical client data  frequency severity and rate level forecasts and professional judgment 
this method is often useful when there is limited historical data due to few losses being incurred 
paid loss development method 
this method estimates ultimate losses by calculating past paid loss development factors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected paid loss development 
the paid loss development method assumes that losses are paid at a rate consistent with the historical rate of payment 
it provides an objective test of reported loss projections because paid losses contain no reserve estimates 
for many lines of business  claim payments are made slowly and it may take many years for claims to be fully reported and settled 

table of contents reported loss development method 
this method estimates ultimate losses by using past reported loss development factors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected reported loss development 
since reported losses include payments and case reserves  changes in both of these amounts are incorporated in this method 
this approach provides a larger volume of data to estimate ultimate losses than paid loss methods 
thus  reported loss patterns may be less varied than paid loss patterns  especially for coverages that have historically been paid out over a long period of time but for which claims are reported relatively early and case loss reserve estimates established 
bornhuetter ferguson paid and reported loss methods 
these methods are a weighted average of the initial expected loss ratio and the relevant development factor method 
the weighting between the two methods depends on the maturity of the business 
this means that for the more recent years a greater weight is placed on the initial expected loss ratio  while for the more mature years a greater weight is placed on the development factor methods 
these methods avoid some of the distortions that could result from a large development factor being applied to a small base of paid or reported losses to calculate ultimate losses 
this method will react slowly if actual paid or reported loss experience develops differently than historical paid or reported loss experience because of major changes in rate levels  retentions or deductibles  the forms and conditions of coverage  the types of risks covered or a variety of other factors 
outstanding to ibnr ratio method 
this method is used in selected cases typically for very mature years that still have open claims 
this method assumes that the estimated future loss development is indicated by the current level of case reserves 
frequency severity method 
this method is based on assumptions about the number of claims that will impact a contract and the average ultimate size of those claims 
on excess of loss contracts  reported claims in lower layers provide insight to the expected number of claims that will likely impact the upper layers 
the selection of appropriate actuarial methods to establish reserves may change over time as the underlying loss information becomes more seasoned 
our actuarial projections are based upon an assessment of known facts and circumstances  historical data  estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  changes in social attitudes  political and economic conditions  including the effects of inflation  and judicial theories of liability factors  including the actions of third parties  which are beyond our control 
we rely on data reported by clients when calculating reserves 
the quality of the data varies from client to client 
our actuarial and claims management teams periodically analyze our clients loss data to ascertain its quality and credibility 
this process may involve comparisons with submission data and industry loss data  claims audits and inquiries about the methods of establishing case reserves associated with large industry events 
our reserving methodologies use a loss reserving model that calculates a point estimate for our ultimate losses 
although we believe that our assumptions and methodologies are reasonable  we cannot be certain that our ultimate payments will not vary  potentially materially  from the estimates we have made 
we believe that the provision for outstanding losses and benefits is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses incurred to the balance sheet date  but the provision is necessarily an estimate and could potentially be settled for a significantly greater or lesser amount 
these estimates are reviewed regularly and any adjustments to the estimates are recorded in the period they are determined 
see item a risk factors our losses and loss adjustment expenses and benefits may exceed our loss and benefit reserves  which could significantly increase our liabilities and reduce our net income and could have a significant and negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our development of prior period loss reserves  net of reinsurance  has been less than in each of the three years ending december   and and an average of over the past ten years 
based on this experience  we currently believe that it is reasonably likely that net loss reserves could change from currently reported amounts 
this change could be higher or lower depending on client reported data and changes in our assessment of known facts and circumstances 
as of december   a change in net loss reserves would impact our net income and shareholders equity by million 
the uncertainty and degree of judgment used in our estimate of loss reserves varies depending on the nature of the contract and the line of business 
for the purposes of the following discussion  we consider the losses for the following lines of business to be included within property losses agriculture  aviation  marine energy  property and other 
we consider losses for the accident health  auto  credit  excess liability  financial institutions  general casualty  international casualty  medical malpractice  professional liability  surety  whole account and workers compensation lines of business to be classified as casualty losses 

table of contents casualty losses are generally long tailed  which means that there can be a significant delay between the occurrence of a loss and the time it is settled by the insurer 
these losses are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and a changing legal environment 
in addition  the casualty business generally has a longer reporting lag and payment pattern than property business 
due to these factors  the estimation of loss reserves for casualty business generally involves a higher degree of judgment than for short tailed business 
property losses are generally short tailed and are usually known and paid within a relatively short period of time after the underlying loss event has occurred 
our estimates for losses resulting from catastrophic events are based upon a combination of internal and external catastrophe models  as well as client and location specific assessments and reports  where available 
these estimates are developed immediately after the loss event  and the loss estimates are subsequently refined based on broker advices and client notifications 
losses and benefits recoverable from reinsurers we reinsure or retrocede portions of certain risks for which we have accepted liability 
in these transactions  we cede to a counterparty reinsurer or retrocessionaire all or part of the risk we have assumed 
this purchase of reinsurance does not legally discharge our liability with respect to the obligations that we have insured or reinsured 
the determination of the amount of losses and benefits recoverable from reinsurers requires an estimate of the amount of loss reserves to be ceded to our reinsurers 
this consists of recoverable amounts related to both our case and ibnr reserves 
the reinsurance recoveries are estimated on a contract by contract basis by applying the terms of any applicable reinsurance coverage to our reserve estimates 
we evaluate and monitor the financial strength of each of our counterparties 
some reinsurance and retrocessional agreements give us the right to receive additional collateral or to terminate the agreement in the event of deterioration in the financial strength of the counterparty 
as of december   of our losses recoverable were with reinsurers rated a or above by am best and were rated a 
the remaining were with nr not rated reinsurers 
grand central re limited  or grand central re  a bermuda domiciled reinsurance company in which we have a equity investment  is our largest nr not rated retrocessionaire and accounted for of our losses recoverable as of december  as security for outstanding loss obligations  we retain funds from grand central re amounting to of its loss recoverable obligations 
of the remaining amount with nr not rated retrocessionaires  we retain collateral equal to of the losses and benefits recoverable 
our losses and benefits recoverable are not due for payment until the underlying loss has been paid 
as of december   of our losses and benefits recoverable were not due for payment 
disputes in connection with our ongoing analysis of our loss reserves  we review loss notifications and reports received from our clients to confirm that submitted claims are covered under the contract terms 
disputes with clients arise in the ordinary course of business due to coverage issues such as classes of business covered and interpretation of contract wording 
we typically resolve any disputes through negotiations that could vary from a simple exchange of email correspondence to arbitration with a panel of experts 
our contracts generally provide for dispute resolution through arbitration 
we are not currently involved in any coverage disputes that we believe would  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect upon our business or results of operations 
property and casualty loss reserve development the following table presents the development of balance sheet property and casualty loss reserves calculated in accordance with us gaap  as of december  through december  this table does not present accident or policy year development data 
the top line of the table shows the gross reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years and is reconciled to the net reserve by adjusting for reinsurance recoverables 
this represents the estimated amount of net claims and claim expenses arising in the current year and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including ibnr reserves 
the table also shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves as adjusted for new information received as of the end of each succeeding year 

table of contents the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
the net cumulative redundancy deficiency represents the aggregate change to date from the original estimate on the third line of the table reserve for property and casualty losses  originally stated  net of reinsurance

table of contents during  our re estimated balance sheet reserves for and each subsequent balance sheet decreased as a result of net favorable development on a large number of contracts from varied underwriting years and lines of business 
the more significant development included net favorable development for the insurance segment of million of which million was recognized on general casualty and million on professional liability lines of business  primarily on the and years  and million on the short tail property and aviation lines of business from the and years  net favorable development for the reinsurance segment of million  excluding the development associated with changes in reinsurance premium estimates described below 
we recorded net favorable development on long tail lines of business  including million from workers compensation primarily on the year  million on professional liability primarily on and prior years offset by unfavorable development of million on medical malpractice primarily on and years 
we recorded net favorable development on short tail lines of business  including million on property primarily on and prior years and million on aviation primarily on the and years  net favorable development for our alterra at lloyd s segment of million  principally recognized on the financial institutions and property lines of business  net unfavorable development for our us specialty segment of million  including million and million of net unfavorable development on the general casualty and property lines of business  respectively  relating to our contract binding business  the renewal rights for which we sold during the year  net unfavorable development of million arising from increases in reinsurance premium estimates 
changes in premium estimates occur on prior year contracts each year as we receive additional information on the underlying exposures insured and the associated loss is recorded  at the original loss ratio  concurrently with the premium adjustment 
the unfavorable development was partially offset by an increase in earned premium net of acquisition costs of million  and net favorable development of million arising from decreases in premium estimates in our insurance segment 
our balance sheet reserves for and each subsequent balance sheet date through in the above tables shows the effects of the development on two specific contracts recorded in the development on these two contracts in the years subsequent to has not been significant 
the first contract increased reserves by million  with the recording of such increased losses triggering additional premiums and interest on additional premiums of million  which are not reflected in the table above 
the second contract increased reserves by million  reserves by million and reserves by million  for a total increase of million 
the adverse development triggered additional premiums and interest on such additional premiums of million  which are not reflected in the table above 
changes in loss estimates principally arise from changes in underlying reported  incurred and paid claims data on contracts 
other assumptions used in our process  such as inflation  change infrequently in the reserving process and we do not perform a sensitivity analysis of changes in these assumptions 
given the variety of assumptions and judgments involved in establishing reserves for losses and benefits  we have not designed and maintained a system to capture and quantify the financial impact of changes in each of our underlying individual assumptions and judgments 
for additional information on our reserves  including a reconciliation of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves for the years ended december   and  refer to note of our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
life and annuity benefit reserve process our life and annuity reinsurance benefit and claim reserves are compiled by our actuaries on a reinsurance contract by contract basis and are computed on a discounted basis using standard actuarial techniques and cash flow models 
we establish and review our life and annuity reinsurance reserves regularly based upon cash flow projection models utilizing data provided by clients and actuarial models 
we establish and maintain our life and annuity reinsurance reserves at a level that we estimate will  when taken together with future premium payments and investment income expected to be earned on associated premiums  be sufficient to support all future cash flow benefit obligations and third party servicing obligations as they become payable 
since the development of our life and annuity reinsurance reserves is based upon cash flow projection models  we make estimates and assumptions based on cedant experience and industry mortality tables  longevity  expense and investment experience  including a provision for adverse deviation 
the assumptions used to determine policy benefit reserves are best estimate assumptions that are determined at the inception of the contracts and are locked in throughout the life of the reinsurance contract unless a premium 
table of contents deficiency develops 
the assumptions are reviewed no less than annually and are un locked if they result in a material reserve change 
we establish these estimates based upon transaction specific historical experience  information provided by the ceding company and industry experience studies 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
as the experience on the contracts emerges  the assumptions are reviewed by management 
we determine whether actual and anticipated experience indicates that existing policy reserves  together with the present value of future gross premiums  are sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits  settlement and maintenance costs and to recover unamortized acquisition costs 
if such a review produces reserves in excess of those currently held then the lock in assumptions are revised and an additional life and annuity benefit reserve is recognized at that time 
there have been no material reserve adjustments to our life and annuity reinsurance benefit reserves during the years ended december   and because of the many assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves and the long term nature of reinsurance contracts  the reserving process  while based on actuarial science  is inherently uncertain 
valuation of investments we invest in a trading portfolio of fixed maturities securities  an available for sale portfolio of fixed maturities securities and a held to maturity portfolio of fixed maturities securities 
we record the trading and available for sale portfolios at fair value on our balance sheet 
for our trading portfolio  the unrealized gain or loss associated with the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of the investments is recorded in net income 
for our available for sale portfolio  the unrealized gain or loss absent credit losses is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
in an effort to match the expected cash flow requirements of our long term liabilities  we invest a portion of our fixed maturity investments in long duration securities 
because we intend to hold a number of these long duration securities to maturity  we classify those securities as held to maturity in our consolidated balance sheet and record these securities at amortized cost 
as a result  we do not record changes in the fair value of this portfolio  which should reduce the impact on shareholders equity of fluctuations in fair value of those investments 
our other investments comprise our investments in hedge funds  investments in structured deposits and various derivative instruments  all of which are recorded at fair value 
other investments also include private equity investments in which we have significant influence and are accounted for under the equity method 
we measure fair value in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc   fair value measurements 
the guidance dictates a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level model derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
thus  a level fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable level and and unobservable level 
the use of valuation techniques may require a significant amount of judgment 
during periods of market disruption  including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable 
fixed maturities fixed maturities are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in interest rates  changes in issuer specific circumstances such as credit rating and changes in industry specific circumstances such as movements in credit spreads based on the market s perception of industry risks 
as a result of these potential fluctuations  it is possible to have significant unrealized gains or losses on a security 
our strategy for our fixed maturities portfolio is to tailor the maturities of the portfolio to the timing of expected loss and benefit payments 
at maturity  absent any credit loss  fixed maturities amortized cost will equal their fair value and no realized gain 
table of contents or loss will be recognized in income 
if  due to an unforeseen change in loss payment patterns  we need to sell any available for sale investments before maturity  we could realize significant gains or losses in any period  which could result in a meaningful effect on reported net income for such period 
we perform regular reviews of our available for sale and held to maturity fixed maturities portfolios and utilize a process that considers numerous indicators in order to identify investments that are showing signs of potential other than temporary impairments 
these indicators include the length of time and extent of the unrealized loss  any specific adverse conditions  historic and implied volatility of the security  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest payments  expected cash flow analysis  significant rating changes and recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
the consideration of these indicators and the estimation of credit losses involve significant management judgment 
any other than temporary impairment  or otti  related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings  and the amount of the otti related to other factors eg interest rates  market conditions  etc 
is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
if no credit loss exists but either we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity security before its anticipated recovery  then the entire unrealized loss is recognized in earnings 
in periods after the recognition of an otti loss on fixed maturity securities  we account for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the otti at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the net impairment loss recognized in earnings 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges through earnings of million  million and during the years ended december   and  respectively 
fair value prices for all securities in our fixed maturities portfolio are independently provided by our investment custodians  investment accounting service provider and or our investment managers  which each utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services 
we record the unadjusted price provided by the investment custodian or the investment accounting service provider after an internal validation process 
our validation process includes  but is not limited to i comparison of prices between two independent sources  with significant differences requiring additional price sources  ii quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark with significant differences identified and investigated  iii evaluation of methodologies used by external parties to calculate fair value  and iv comparing the price to our knowledge of the current investment market 
the independent pricing services used by our investment custodians  investment accounting service provider and investment managers obtain actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
each pricing service has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded 
in general  these methods involve the use of matrix pricing in which the independent pricing service uses observable market inputs  including reported trades  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates and such other inputs as are available from market sources to determine a reasonable fair value 
in addition  pricing services use valuation models  such as an option adjusted spread model  to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the option adjusted spread model is commonly used to estimate fair value for securities such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the ability to obtain quoted market prices is reduced in periods of decreasing liquidity  which generally increases the use of matrix pricing methods and generally increases the uncertainty surrounding the fair value estimates 
this could result in the reclassification of a security between levels of the hierarchy 
other investments our hedge fund portfolio comprises a portfolio of limited partnership and stock investments in trading entities  or funds  which invest in a wide range of financial products 
investments in the funds are carried at fair value 
the change in fair value is included in net realized and unrealized gains on investments and recognized in net income 
the units of account that we fair value are our interests in the funds and not the underlying holdings of such funds 
thus  the inputs we use to value our investments in each of the funds may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of such funds 
these funds are stated at fair value  which ordinarily will be the most recently reported net asset value as advised by the fund manager or administrator  where the fund s underlying holdings can be in various quoted and unquoted investments 
we believe the reported net asset value represents the fair value market participants would apply to an interest in the fund 
the fund managers value their underlying investments at fair value in accordance with policies established by each fund  as described in each of their financial statements and offering memoranda 
based upon information provided by the fund managers  as of december   we estimate that over of the underlying assets in the funds are publicly traded securities or have broker quotes available 
we have designed ongoing due diligence processes with respect to funds and their managers 
these processes are designed to assist us in assessing the quality of information provided by  or on behalf of  each fund and in determining whether such information continues to be reliable or whether further review is necessary 
certain funds do not provide full transparency of their underlying holdings  however  we obtain the audited financial statements for every fund annually  and regularly review and discuss the fund performance with the fund managers to corroborate the reasonableness of the reported net asset values 
while reported net asset value is the primary input to the review  when the net asset value is deemed not to be indicative of fair value  we may incorporate adjustments to the reported net asset value 
such adjustments may involve significant management judgment 

table of contents as of december   certain of our funds had either imposed a gate on redemptions or segregated a portion of the underlying assets into a side pocket whereby the funds are assigned to a separate memorandum capital account or designated account 
a gate refers to funds which provide for periodic redemptions  however  in accordance with the funds governing documents  a fund with a gate has the ability to deny or delay a redemption request 
based on the review process applied by management on such funds  a reduction of million was made to the net asset value reported by one fund manager as of december  million to adjust the carrying value of the fund to our best estimate of fair value 
additional information about the fair values of our hedge fund portfolio can be found in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
our structured deposit has a fair value that is based on a publicly quoted index 
our derivatives holdings comprise convertible bond equity call options  interest rate linked derivative instruments  credit derivatives and foreign currency forward contracts 
the fair value of the equity call options is determined using an option adjusted spread model  the significant inputs for which include equity prices  interest rates and benchmark yields 
the other derivative instruments trade in the over the counter derivative market  or are priced based on broker dealer quotes or quoted market prices for similar securities 
fair values of our catastrophe bonds are based on dealer quotes and  if available  trade prices 
a review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis 
changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets and liabilities 
reclassifications impacting level of the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in out of the level category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur 
premium recognition we follow asc  financial services insurance in determining the accounting for our insurance and reinsurance products 
assessing whether or not the contracts we write meet the conditions for risk transfer requires judgment 
the determination of risk transfer is based  in part  on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions 
insurance premium recognition our insurance premiums are recorded at the inception of each contract based upon contract terms 
the amount of minimum and or deposit premium is usually contractually documented at inception  and variances between deposit premium and final premium are generally small 
an adjustment is made to the minimum and or deposit premium if there are changes in underlying exposures insured based on information received from our clients 
premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period 
reinsurance premium recognition our reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of each contract based upon contract terms and information received from ceding clients and brokers 
for excess of loss contracts  the amount of minimum and or deposit premium is usually contractually documented at inception  and variances between this premium and final premium are generally small 
an adjustment is made to the minimum and or deposit premium  when notified  if there are changes in underlying exposures insured 
for quota share or proportional reinsurance contracts  gross premiums written are normally estimated at inception based on information provided by cedants and or brokers 
we generally record such premiums using the client s initial estimates  and then adjust them as more current information becomes available  with such adjustments recorded as premiums written in the period they are determined 
we believe that the ceding clients estimate of the volume of business they expect to cede to us usually represents the best estimate of gross premium written at the beginning of the contract 
as the contract progresses  we monitor actual premium received in conjunction with correspondence from the ceding client in order to refine our estimate 
variances from original premium estimates are normally greater for quota share contracts than excess of loss contracts 
premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period 
the pre tax impact to net income may be mitigated by related acquisition costs and losses 
during the years ended december   and  we wrote the following amounts of reinsurance premiums on a quota share or proportional basis and excess of loss basis in millions of us dollars quota share proportional excess of loss total 
table of contents the net adjustments to gross premiums written as a result of changes in premium estimates were an increase of million  for the year ended december  and decreases of million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
such adjustments are generally the result of changing market conditions experienced by our clients 
additional premiums certain reinsurance contracts that we write are retrospectively rated and we are entitled to additional premium should losses exceed pre determined  contractual thresholds 
these additional premiums are based upon contractual terms and management judgment is involved with respect to the estimated amount of losses that we expect to be ceded to us 
additional premiums are recognized at the time loss thresholds specified in the contract are exceeded and are earned over the remaining coverage period  or are earned immediately if the period of risk coverage has passed 
changes in estimates of losses recorded on contracts with additional premium features will result in changes in additional premiums based on contractual terms 
additional premiums assumed and ceded  related net losses and the net impact on operating results for the years ended december   and are as follows in million of us dollars decrease increase in gross premiums written decrease increase in premiums ceded decrease in net losses increase in income before tax for each of the years ended december   and  additional premiums relate to contracts where the coverage period had expired 
therefore  these additional premiums  representing revisions to our initial estimate of ultimate premiums as a result of changes in the estimate of loss reserves  were fully earned since the exposure period had ended 
as of december   the majority of retrospectively rated contracts have been settled and  therefore  we expect such adjustments to have an immaterial impact on future periods 
reinstatement premiums certain contracts we write  particularly property catastrophe reinsurance contracts  provide for reinstatements of coverage 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums for the restoration of the insurance or reinsurance limit of a contract to its full amount after a loss occurrence by the insured or reinsured 
the purpose of optional and required reinstatements is to permit the insured reinsured to reinstate the insurance coverage at a pre determined price level once a loss event has penetrated the insured layer 
in addition  required reinstatement premiums permit the insurer reinsurer to obtain additional premiums to cover the additional loss limits provided 
we accrue for reinstatement premiums resulting from losses recorded 
such accruals are based upon contractual terms and the only element of management judgment involved is with respect to the amount of losses recorded 
changes in estimates of losses recorded on contracts with reinstatement premium features will result in changes in reinstatement premiums based on contractual terms 
reinstatement premiums are recognized at the time we record losses and are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period 
reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively 
reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded were not material for the years ended december  and premiums receivable for quota share  or proportional  contracts  we are entitled to receive premium as the ceding client collects the premium under contractual reporting and payment terms  which are usually quarterly 
premiums are usually collected over a two year period on our quota share or proportional contracts 
for excess of loss contracts  premium is generally paid in contractually stipulated installments with payment terms ranging from payment at the inception of the contract to four quarterly payments 
as a result of recognizing the estimated gross premium written at the inception of the policy and collecting that premium over an extended period  we include a premium receivable asset on our balance sheet 
we actively monitor our premium receivable asset to consider whether we need an allowance for doubtful accounts 
as part of this process  we consider the credit quality of our cedants and monitor premium receipts versus expectations 
we also seek to include a right of offset in the contract terms 
since commencing our operations  premiums receivable written off have not been material and  currently  no material premiums receivable are significantly beyond their due dates or in dispute

this segment comprises our proportionate share of the underwriting results of the syndicates  and the results of our managing agent  alterra at lloyd s 
the syndicates underwrite a diverse portfolio of specialty risks  including accident health  aviation  financial institutions  international casualty  marine  professional liability  property and surety 
life and annuity reinsurance we previously offered reinsurance products focusing on blocks of life and annuity business  which took the form of co insurance transactions whereby the risks are reinsured on the same basis as the original policies 
we have decided not to write any new life and annuity contracts for the foreseeable future 
we also have a corporate function that includes our investment and financing activities and all other items not allocated to the segments  including interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses 
we manage our invested assets on an aggregated basis  and do not allocate investment income and realized and unrealized gains on investments to the property and casualty segments 
because of the longer duration of liabilities on life and annuity reinsurance business  investment returns are important in evaluating the profitability of this segment  accordingly  we allocate investment returns from the consolidated portfolio to this segment 
the allocation is based on a notional allocation of invested assets from the consolidated portfolio using durations that are determined based on estimated cash flows for the life segment 
the balance of investment returns from this consolidated portfolio is allocated to the corporate function for the purposes of segment reporting 
we monitor the performance of all of our segments other than life and annuity reinsurance on the basis of underwriting income  loss ratio  acquisition ratio  general and administrative expense ratio and combined ratio 
we monitor the performance of our life and annuity reinsurance business on the basis of income before taxes for the segment  which includes revenue from net premiums earned  allocated net investment income and realized and unrealized gains on investments  and expenses from claims and policy benefits  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
effective january   we redefined two of our operating and reporting segments based on changes to our internal reporting structure 
insurance business written by alterra insurance usa  which was previously reported within the us specialty segment  has been reclassified to the insurance segment 
alterra insurance usa is a managing general underwriter for alterra e s and alterra america  as well as various third party insurance companies  and is our principal insurance underwriting platform for retail distribution in the united states 
segment disclosures for comparative periods have been revised to reflect this reclassification 
net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments are discussed within the investing activities section of this report and not within the segment sections of this report

premiums 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased by compared to the prior year 
the principal reason for the increase was the additional reinsurance premiums written as a result of the amalgamation  which were not included in the comparative period prior to may  in addition  favorable market conditions in the property and auto lines of business in the reinsurance segment resulted in increased premiums written in these lines 
we also continued to expand our product offerings in alterra at lloyd s and our operations in latin america generated increased levels of premiums written in the year ended december  our insurance and u 
s specialty segments also had modest growth in premiums written during the year primarily due to pricing increases and new business in certain lines of business as well as increased product offerings 
the growth in gross premiums written for the year ended december  was primarily in short tail lines of business resulting in a change in mix of gross premiums written from short tail lines and long tail lines for the year ended december  to short tail lines and long tail lines 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased by compared to the prior year 
our reinsurance segment was impacted in by the addition of premiums written by the former harbor point companies 
gross premiums written also increased in our us specialty and alterra at lloyd s segments as a result of our new product offerings  the addition of new underwriting teams  and our expansion into latin america 
these increases  and those resulting from the amalgamation  were principally offset by decreases in the level of premiums written in our insurance  reinsurance excluding harbor point and life and 
table of contents annuity reinsurance segments 
the lower premium volume in our insurance and reinsurance segments reflect expected reductions across several lines of business due to competitive market conditions  resulting in reduced writings because pricing did not meet our risk return thresholds 
the decrease in our life and annuity segment was principally due to no new contracts being written in this segment during the years ended december  and  compared to one contract written in the year ended december  we made the decision in not to write any new life and annuity contracts for the foreseeable future 
a discussion of pro forma reinsurance segment results including harbor point in the and comparative figures is in the section entitled reinsurance segment on a pro forma basis

on a pro forma comparative basis  gross premiums written for the year ended december  would have increased by 
the increase would have been principally due to growth in our alterra at lloyd s segment resulting from expansion of our platform  partially offset by decreases in several lines of business in our reinsurance segment due to challenging market conditions and increased competition 
on a pro forma basis  the gross premiums written for the year ended december  would have decreased by 
this decrease would have principally been driven by lower premium volumes in our insurance and reinsurance segments  along with a decrease in our life and annuity reinsurance segment 
the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the percentage of reinsurance premiums ceded compared to the prior year was principally due to the amalgamation and the reduction in the amount of business ceded by our reinsurance segment 
this was partially offset due to the retrocession of the business written through our contracted general agent distribution channel our contract binding business in our us specialty segment starting from august  see section entitled us specialty  along with the impact of additional ceded reinstatement premiums in our alterra at lloyd s segment 
we continually monitor our need for reinsurance based on aggregate risk exposures 
the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was principally due to the inclusion of the former harbor point business from may  at a lower ratio of ceded to written premiums  and the cancellation of a significant property quota share treaty in our us specialty segment 
the cancellation of the property quota share treaty in our us specialty segment reduced reinsurance premiums ceded by million 
net premiums earned is a function of the earning of gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded over the last several quarters and  therefore  changes in net premiums earned generally lag quarterly increases and decreases in gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded 
as a result  net premiums earned tend to be less volatile than gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded 
the increase in net premiums earned for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was principally due to the incremental earnings as a result of the amalgamation 
in addition  organic growth in our alterra at lloyd s segment contributed to the increase in net premiums earned 
the increase in net premiums earned for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was principally due to the incremental earnings as a result of the amalgamation 
net investment income 
net investment income for the year ended december  increased by compared to the prior year 
the increase in net investment income was principally attributable to the increase in cash and invested assets as a result of the amalgamation  with some additional benefit from shifting cash into higher yielding fixed maturity securities 
our average investment yield was for the year ended december  compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the yields available in the current fixed maturity market generally are lower than the average yield on our existing portfolio 
due to the anticipated continuing low yield market environment  we expect continued downwards pressure on our investment yield 

table of contents net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments 
net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments may vary significantly from period to period 
for the year ended december   the principal component of the net loss was a million loss on a catastrophe bond with exposure to the japan earthquake and tsunami  compared to an increase in fair value of catastrophe bonds of million in the prior year period 
the year ended december  also included a decrease in fair value of our hedge funds of million compared to an increase of million in the prior year period  and a decrease in fair value of derivatives of million compared to a decrease of million in the prior year period 
the principal components of the decrease in net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments from the year to the year were hedge fund and derivative returns 
the increase in fair value of hedge funds for the year ended december  was million compared to an increase of million for the year ended december  also contributing to the decrease year over year was a million loss on an interest rate forward transaction entered into in the second quarter of in contemplation of a possible long term debt issuance 
other income 
during the year ended december   alterra e s sold the renewal rights to our contract binding business 
we recognized a net gain on sale of million  which included the derecognition of goodwill of million 
commencing august   until the earlier of the date the purchaser or alterra e s elects and february   the contract binding business will be written by alterra e s and we will cede of the premiums and losses to the purchaser 
under the terms of the sale  we are entitled to additional contingent consideration should gross premiums written by the contract binding business exceed a specified threshold while the quota share reinsurance agreement is still in effect 
also included in other income in the year ended december  are fees earned for the management of new point re iv 
net losses and loss expenses 
the loss ratio increased by percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  significant items impacting the loss ratio were net favorable loss development of prior year reserves  excluding the effect of premium adjustments  for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december   net favorable loss development for the year ended december  was principally the result of net favorable development in our property  workers compensation  general casualty  professional liability  aviation and whole account lines of business  partially offset by net unfavorable development in the medical malpractice line of business in our reinsurance segment and in the general liability line in our us specialty segment 
the unfavorable reserve development in our us specialty segment principally related to the contract binding business  for which we sold the renewal rights for all renewals after august  excluding the net favorable loss development  the loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the loss ratio for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was principally due to the increase in significant property catastrophe losses in  and for the year ended december   our results included incurred losses net of reinsurance of million compared to million related to significant property catastrophe events and significant per risk losses 
the significant property catastrophe event net losses for the year ended december  included losses resulting from the australia floods  cyclone yasi  the new zealand earthquake  the japan earthquake and tsunami  tornadoes and flooding in the united states  hurricane irene and the thailand floods 
for the year ended december   our results included net losses of million for property catastrophe events  including losses resulting from the chile earthquake  europe windstorm xynthia and australia hailstorms 
the loss ratio decreased by percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  significant items impacting the loss ratio were net favorable loss development of prior year reserves  excluding the effect of premium adjustments  for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december   net favorable loss development for the year ended december  was principally the result of net favorable development in our workers compensation  property  general casualty  professional liability and whole account lines of business  partially offset by net unfavorable development on marine energy lines  compared to net favorable development on professional liability  property and general casualty lines offset by net unfavorable development on marine energy lines in the year ended december   excluding the net favorable loss development  the loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the loss ratio for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was principally due to the inclusion of net premiums earned from harbor point since may  at a significantly lower loss ratio  which reduced the average loss ratio despite the increase in property catastrophe losses discussed below 
the loss ratio for the year ended december  on the net premiums earned related to the harbor point portfolio of contracts did not include any significant property catastrophe losses  other than from the new zealand earthquake  as most of the significant property catastrophe loss events occurred prior to the amalgamation  
table of contents the loss ratio for the year ended december  benefitted from the million amortization of the fair value adjustment made to the acquired harbor point net loss reserves at the date of the amalgamation 
this fair value adjustment is being amortized over a weighted average period of years  and the decrease in loss ratio described above was partially offset by an increase in net losses related to property catastrophe events and significant per risk losses 
for the year ended december   our results included net losses of million related to property catastrophe events and significant per risk losses 
for the year ended december   our results included net losses of million for such events 
our loss estimates for the property catastrophe losses are based on proprietary modeling analyses  industry assessments of exposure  claims information obtained from our clients and brokers to date  and a review of in force contracts 
our actual losses from these events may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations resulting from several factors  including the preliminary nature of available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques employed and the application of such techniques  the contingent nature of business interruption exposures  the effects of any resultant demand surge on claims activity  and the attendant coverage issues 
claims and policy benefits 
we did not write any new life and annuity reinsurance contracts in the years ended december  and we wrote one new life and annuity reinsurance contract in the year ended december  we do not intend to write any new life and annuity reinsurance contracts in our life and annuity reinsurance segment in the foreseeable future 
acquisition costs 
our acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  increased by percentage points compared to the prior year 
the increase in the acquisition cost ratio was principally due to changes in the mix of business written 
the insurance and reinsurance contracts we write have a wide range of acquisition cost ratios 
our relative mix of insurance and reinsurance business has moved towards more reinsurance  with of net premiums earned being from reinsurance business for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this resulted in an increase in the acquisition cost ratio as reinsurance business tends to have higher acquisition costs compared to insurance 
a decrease in the level of reinsurance purchased across our segments also contributed to the increase in the ratio for the year ended december  as we retain more business in our segments  we receive less ceding commission income to offset our brokerage and commission costs  which increases our acquisition cost ratio 
our acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  increased by percentage points compared to the year ended december  the increase in the acquisition cost ratio was principally due to changes in the mix of business written  partially influenced by the additional net premiums earned from the former harbor point companies 
the harbor point portfolio of contracts contained a higher proportion of quota share contracts  which generally carry higher acquisition cost ratios than excess of loss contracts 
a decrease in the level of reinsurance purchased across all of our segments  but in particular our us specialty segment  also contributed to the increase in the ratio for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense includes interest on funds withheld from reinsurers  interest on our senior notes outstanding and accretion of deposit liability contracts 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december   and increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in both periods was principally a result of the issuance of senior notes in september of in addition  an adjustment to the deposit liability on a certain contract based on new information received resulted in an increase in interest expense in for the year ended december   an increase in funds withheld interest for one of our largest reinsurers contributed to the increase over the year ended december  merger and acquisition expenses 
merger and acquisition expenses for the year ended december  comprised advisory  legal and other professional fees  the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and other merger related expenses related to the amalgamation 
these expenses were offset by the negative goodwill gain of million recognized from the amalgamation 
merger and acquisition expenses for the year ended december  comprised advisory  legal and other professional fees related to the proposed transaction with ipc holdings limited and ipc limited  which was terminated in june  offset by a million termination fee received 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  the increase was principally due to the increased size of the company following the amalgamation 
the year ended december  was the first full fiscal year of post amalgamation level expenses 
expansion of our underwriting teams  growth in latin america and regulatory changes in europe also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses in the period 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in incentive based compensation 
the increase in net earned premiums resulted in a small decrease in our general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
table of contents general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  the increase was principally related to the additional general and administrative expenses of the former harbor point companies 
in addition  there was an increase in performance based compensation expense as a result of a larger cash component of the performance based compensation than in however  the corresponding increase in net earned premiums as a result of the amalgamation resulted in no change in our general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  income tax expense benefit 
corporate income tax expense or benefit is generated through our foreign operations outside of bermuda  principally in the united states  europe and latin america 
the effective tax rate was negative for the year ended december  compared with in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  our effective income tax rate  which we calculate as income tax expense or benefit divided by net income or loss before taxes  may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on the geographic distribution of pre tax net income or loss in any given period between different jurisdictions with different tax rates 
the geographic distribution of pre tax net income or loss can vary significantly between periods principally due to the mix of business written and earned during the period  the geographic location of investment income and realized and unrealized investment gains and losses and the geographic location of net losses and loss expenses incurred 
our effective tax rate changed significantly for the year ended december  due principally to two factors 
our results for the year ended december  contained a significant amount of property catastrophe losses and the distribution of these losses was heavily weighted towards jurisdictions with a higher tax rate 
further contributing to the change in effective tax rate was the release of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in our us subsidiaries  which had the effect of increasing the tax benefit for the year

premiums 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased by compared to the prior year 
significant factors affecting gross premiums written were an increase in property gross premiums written  principally due to improved pricing conditions  and competitive pricing conditions in professional liability  excess liability and aviation resulted in flat or decreased levels of business written 
our objective is to continue to be selective in our renewals and new business writings  focusing on business that we believe meet our rate of return requirements 
gross premiums written decreased in the year ended december  by compared to the year ended december  significant factors affecting gross premiums written were a decrease in gross premiums written in the aviation line for the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in aviation business written in our alterra at lloyd s segment as many of the policies previously written in our insurance segment were renewed by alterra at lloyd s  and a decrease in gross premiums written in our excess liability line for the year ended december  due to fewer attractive opportunities 
the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was  compared to and  respectively  in the years ended december  and december  the amount of reinsurance that we purchase can vary significantly by line of business 
the increase in the percentage of reinsurance premiums ceded is principally due to changes in the mix of business and an increase in the percentage of quota share reinsurance purchased on our property line of business to manage our aggregate exposures 
a contributing factor to the decrease in was the reduction in property reinsurance premiums ceded to harbor point  which became fully eliminated intercompany transactions after the amalgamation 
we replaced those reinsurance premiums ceded with third parties over the course of the normal renewal periods 
net premiums earned is a function of the earning of gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded over the last several quarters and  therefore  changes in net premiums earned generally lag quarterly increases and decreases in gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded 
as a result  net premiums earned tend to be less volatile than gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded

large events during the year ended december  included the chile earthquake and flooding in australia 
these losses were contained within our annual loss expectations for the property line of business 
there were no significant property catastrophe events and significant per risk losses occurring in the year ended december  changes in premium estimates for contracts that incepted before resulted in a decrease in prior year loss reserves of million in and an increase in prior year loss reserves of million in and million in acquisition costs

acquisition costs generally fluctuate based on shifts in business mix year over year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase was principally due to increased headcount and expenses associated with expanding our underwriting infrastructure within alterra insurance usa 
these increases  together with the decrease in net premiums earned  resulted in a higher general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  compared to the prior year

favorable loss development principally emerged on the and prior years for the property line of business  on the year for workers compensation relating to the favorable settlement of a contract  on the and years for aviation and on the and prior years for the professional liability line of business 
this favorable loss development was partially offset by unfavorable development principally on the and years for the medical malpractice line of business 

table of contents excluding net favorable loss development  the loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year periods after adding back a million reduction to net premiums earned for a workers compensation contract discussed below 
the increase in the loss ratio for the year ended december  compared to december  was due principally to the increase in property catastrophe and significant per risk losses  and the year ended december  included million in significant property catastrophe related losses compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   property catastrophe losses included losses resulting from the australia floods  cyclone yasi  the new zealand earthquake  the japan earthquake and tsunami  tornadoes and flooding in the united states  hurricane irene and the thailand floods

despite the increase in property catastrophe losses discussed below  the loss ratio on the net premiums earned related to the former harbor point portfolio of contracts does not include any significant property catastrophe losses other than from the new zealand earthquake as most of the year s property catastrophe loss events occurred prior to the amalgamation  the loss ratio for the year ended december  benefitted from the million amortization of the fair value adjustment made to the acquired harbor point net loss reserves at the date of the amalgamation 
this fair value adjustment is being amortized over a weighted average period of years  and partially offsetting the decrease described above was the increased property catastrophe related and significant per risk losses 
the year ended december  included million in property catastrophe related and significant per risk losses  principally as a result of the deepwater horizon oil spill  europe windstorm xynthia  australia hailstorms  the new zealand earthquake and floods in australia 
the year ended december  included million in property catastrophe related and significant per risk losses 
increases in net earned premiums  net of acquisition costs of million  resulted in a increase in prior year loss reserves of million for the year ended december  decreases in net earned premiums  net of acquisition costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulted in a decrease in prior year loss reserves of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
changes in premium estimates occur on prior year contracts each year as we receive additional information on the underlying exposures insured and the associated loss is recorded  at the original loss ratio  concurrently with the premium adjustment 
acquisition costs 
the ratio of acquisition costs to net premiums earned for the year ended december  increased percentage points compared to the year ended december  the reinsurance contracts that we write have a wide range of acquisition cost ratios and the variance is the result of shifts in the mix of business written and earned 
for the year ended december   a higher proportion of net earned premiums were from our auto  whole account and credit surety lines of business  which generally have higher acquisition cost ratios compared to other lines of business 
the ratio of acquisition costs to net premiums earned for the year ended december  increased percentage points compared to the year ended december  the increase in the acquisition cost ratio was principally due to changes in the mix of business written  partially influenced by the additional net premiums earned from the former harbor point companies 
the former harbor point business contains a higher proportion of quota share contracts  which generally have higher acquisition cost ratios than excess of loss contracts 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  this increase was principally due to being the first full fiscal year following the amalgamation 
in addition  an increase in the number of retirement eligible employees  whose stock based compensation awards are fully expensed when granted  and the transfer of some corporate function employees and expenses to the reinsurance segment as part of the amalgamation integration also contributed to the increase 
this impact was partially offset by a decrease in performance based compensation expense 
growth in net premiums earned exceeded the increase in general and administrative expenses  resulting in a decrease of percentage points in the general and administrative loss ratio 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase was principally due to the inclusion of harbor point s expenses for the period from may  in addition  there was an increase in performance based compensation expense as a result of improved underwriting results compared to the prior year  and a shift to a larger cash component and fewer stock based awards  compared to reinsurance segment on a pro forma basis the following table presents certain financial information for the reinsurance segment on an actual reported basis for the year ended december  and on a combined pro forma basis after the elimination of intercompany transactions and the amortization of certain acquisition accounting adjustments for the years ended december  and  for informational purposes only  as if the amalgamation had occurred on january  and january   respectively

premiums 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  were lower than gross premiums written in the prior year period would have been 
significant factors affecting gross premiums written were gross premiums written in our agriculture line of business would have decreased principally due the non renewal of a million contract resulting from the client retaining more business partially offset by an increase in gross premiums written due to two significant new contracts  gross premiums written in our auto line of business increased principally due to an increase in quota share contracts that renewed in the period due to price and volume increases at the ceding companies as well as an increased participation on one contract 
in addition  the year ended december  included an increase in premium estimates of million related to quota share contracts also primarily due to price and volume increases at the ceding companies  gross premiums written in our aviation  general casualty  marine energy and professional liability lines of business decreased principally due to contracts not being renewed or reductions in our participation due to a more competitive pricing environment  gross premiums written in our medical malpractice line of business decreased principally due to the non renewal of two contracts that accounted for million

gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year period 
the increase in gross premiums written was principally due to organic growth in business written in our marine and professional liability lines  and growth in our general liability line of business due to the addition of excess casualty business to our product offerings in this line 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  the increase in gross premiums written was principally due to the addition of professional liability to our product line in the fourth quarter of  focused growth of our general liability line written through the brokerage distribution channel  and moderate growth of to in our marine and property lines of business 
the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year period 
the increase in the percentage of premiums ceded in the year ended december  was principally due to the cession of our contract binding business starting from august  excluding this additional amount of premiums ceded  the percentage of premiums ceded for the year ended december  was

as described above  this business was sold during and we did not retain on our balance sheet any of the business written following the sale 
in addition  there was net unfavorable development in our marine line of business relating to the year 
the net favorable development in the year ended december  principally was on our property line of business  
table of contents excluding the net favorable loss development  the loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was principally due to changes in the mix of business  particularly an increase in the marine and professional liability lines of business 
these lines of business have a higher average loss ratio than property lines  which declined as a percentage of gross premiums written  and our results for the year ended december  include net losses of million for property catastrophe losses compared to million for the year ended december  the significant property catastrophe event net losses for the year ended december  included losses resulting from tornadoes and flooding in the united states and hurricane irene 
the year ended december  included losses resulted from tennessee flooding and northeastern us storms

unfavorable development in our marine and general liability lines of business were the result of increased loss estimates on specific claim reserves  excluding the net favorable loss development  the loss ratio was and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the loss ratio was principally due to changes in the mix of business  and our results for the year ended december  include net losses of million for property catastrophe losses and significant per risk losses 
large loss events in the year ended december  included flooding in tennessee and storms in the northeastern united states 
these losses were contained within our annual loss expectations for the property line of business 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our original estimate of net losses associated with these events by million 
during the year ended december   we did not incur any significant property catastrophe losses or significant per risk losses 
acquisition expenses 
the acquisition cost ratio increased in each of the last two years as we reduced the amount of reinsurance purchased 
as we retain more business  we receive less ceding commission income to offset our brokerage and commission costs  which increases our acquisition cost ratio 
this effect should be tempered over the near term by the ceding commission income we expect to earn on the reinsurance of the contract binding business that we sold in august of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million compared to the prior year 
the increase was principally due to additional costs associated with the sale of our contract binding business  costs associated with the establishment of our new excess casualty platform and an increase in expenses related to stock based compensation 
notwithstanding these factors  the general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  was consistent with the prior year  principally due to the gradual increase in net premiums earned compared to the prior year period 
general and administrative expenses increased in compared to  however  our general and administrative expense ratio decreased

premiums 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year 
the increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to an increase of million in our property line of business for the year ended december  due to growth in our latin america operations for this segment 
our latin america operations generated million of property gross premiums written in compared to million in the prior year 
the year ended december  also benefitted from the addition of our direct and facultative property insurance underwriting team and improved market conditions  as well as million of gross reinstatement premiums principally related to property catastrophe events  an increase of million in our international casualty line of business for the year ended december  we began underwriting this business in the quarter ended march  and the increase reflects the expansion of our client base as well as favorable market conditions

for the year ended december   the above increases were partially offset by a planned decrease in our aviation line of business 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  the increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to the addition of aviation business to our alterra at lloyd s segment in the fourth quarter of  which largely represented a transfer of business previously written within our insurance segment  the addition of international casualty product lines in the first quarter of  which generated million of gross premiums written in the year ended december   and the commencement of underwriting in brazil in  which generated million of gross premiums written for the year ended december   primarily in the property line of business 
the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was compared to for the prior year 
for the year ended december   the increase was impacted by reinstatement premiums ceded as a result of the catastrophe losses during the year 
the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the volume of reinsurance premiums ceded did not increase at the same rate as the increase in gross premiums written because a significant proportion of our reinsurance program are excess of loss contracts rather than quota share proportional contracts 
net premiums earned is a function of the earning of gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded over the last several quarters and  therefore  changes in net premiums earned generally lag quarterly increases and decreases in gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded

acquisition expenses 
the acquisition cost ratio increased percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the year ended december  was impacted by the re estimation of certain commission expenses based on updated information 
the remaining increase was attributable to changes in the mix of business written 
the acquisition cost ratio decreased percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in acquisition costs was principally attributable to the addition of international casualty business in the first quarter of  which has a lower average acquisition cost ratio than other lines of business 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million compared to the prior year 
costs associated with expanding our underwriting teams  growth in brazil and regulatory changes in europe contributed to the absolute increase in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  however  the general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  remained consistent with the year ended december  as net premiums earned increased at almost the same rate 
general and administrative expenses for this segment included profit commission income earned by alterra at lloyd s from the syndicates that were not wholly owned by alterra  which partially offset the costs of managing the syndicates 
profit commission income in the year ended december  benefitted from a non recurring gain of million resulting from the closing of a year of account on one of these third party syndicates 
partially offsetting this profit commission income was an increase in information technology expenses  performance based compensation  and expenses related to our new office in brazil

table of contents there were no new life and annuity contracts written during the years ended december  and one new reinsurance contract was written in the year ended december   accounting for most of the premiums written for that year 
our life and annuity business was focused exclusively on acquiring policies with significant reserve balances  which allowed us to earn a profit by investing at a higher yield than the cost of funds of those reserves 
we were able to execute this strategy successfully in prior years as our investment in hedge funds constituted a significant portion of our total investments and investment yields in general were more attractive 
our investment strategy is now focused primarily on holding high quality fixed maturity securities  which makes it difficult to grow our life and annuity business profitably 
as a result  we have decided not to write any new life and annuity contracts for the foreseeable future 
this decision does not affect our existing life and annuity reinsurance contracts and we continue to service our existing life and annuity customer base 
the nature of life and annuity reinsurance transactions that we historically had written resulted in a limited number of transactions actually bound with potentially large variations in quarterly and annual premium volume 
consequently  components of our underwriting results  such as premiums written  premiums earned and claims and policy benefits can be volatile  and period to period comparisons are not necessarily representative of future trends 
our life and annuity benefit reserves are recorded on a discounted present value basis 
this discount is amortized through income as a claims and policy benefits expense over the term of the underlying policies 
as a result  income is driven by the spread between the actual rate of return on our investments and the interest discount on our reserves  together with differences between estimated and actual claims  premiums  expenses and persistency of the underlying policies 
losses for the years ended december  and were principally due to low rates of return on our hedge fund investments 
net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments for this segment consist entirely of net gains or losses on hedge fund investments 
if hedge fund investments provide a positive rate of return over the long term  we expect that the combination of net investment income from fixed maturities and net gains from hedge funds would exceed the discount rate on our reserves and  therefore  provide positive income for this segment 
gross premiums written  reinsurance premiums ceded  net premiums earned  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses represent ongoing premium receipts or adjustments and related administration expenses on existing contracts 
claims and policy benefits in each period represent reinsured policy claims payments net of the change in policy and claim liabilities 
net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments are discussed within the investing activities section as we manage investments for this segment on a consolidated basis with our other segments

the decrease in fair value of the hedge fund portfolio was million  or a negative rate of return  for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million  or a rate of return  for the year ended december  the rate of return of negative for the year ended december  compares to the hfri fund of funds composite index returning negative over the same period  which we believe is our most relevant benchmark 
the increase in fair value of the hedge fund portfolio was million  or a rate of return  for the year ended december  six of the nine hedge fund strategies we employed experienced negative returns during the year ended december  the largest contributors by investment strategy to the decrease in fair value for the year ended december  were the event driven arbitrage and diversified arbitrage strategies 
as of december   and of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to the event driven arbitrage and diversified arbitrage strategies  respectively 
the largest increase in fair value offsetting the overall decrease for year was contributed by the global macro strategy 
as of december   of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to this strategy 
eight of the ten hedge fund strategies we employed experienced positive returns during the year ended december  the largest contributors by investment strategy to the increase in fair value for the year ended december  were the global macro and the diversified arbitrage strategies 
as of december   and of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to the global macro and diversified arbitrage strategies  respectively 
the largest decrease in fair value offsetting the overall increase for the year was contributed by the event driven arbitrage strategy 
as of december   of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to this strategy 
eight of the nine hedge fund strategies we employed experienced positive returns during the year ended december  the largest contributors by investment strategy to the net gain for the year ended december  were the distressed securities and the event driven arbitrage strategies 
as of december   and of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to the distressed securities and the event driven arbitrage strategies  respectively 
the allocation of invested assets to our hedge fund portfolio as of december  was  which is consistent with our expected ongoing allocation 
the objective of our hedge fund portfolio is to achieve a market neutral absolute return strategy  with diversification by strategy and underlying fund 
a market neutral strategy strives to generate consistent returns in both up and down markets by selecting long and short positions with a total net exposure of zero 
returns are derived from the long short spread  or the amount by which long positions outperform short positions 
the objective of an absolute return strategy is to provide stable performance regardless of market conditions  with minimal correlation to market benchmarks 

table of contents the fair value of derivatives decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to a decrease of million for the year ended december  we hold various derivative instruments  including convertible bond equity call options  interest rate linked derivative instruments and foreign currency forward contracts 
the majority of the loss for the year ended december  came from interest rate swap positions taken as part of a total return strategy followed by a portion of our investment portfolio 
the fair value of derivatives decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to an increase of million for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  we considered replacing our revolving bank loan with longer term debt 
in contemplation of this plan  we entered into two interest rate forward contracts indexed to the us treasury rate 
due to market volatility at that time  we elected not to replace our revolving bank loan and the forward contracts were settled for a loss of million in the second quarter  which resulted in the majority of the loss for the year ended december  nearly all of the decrease in fair value of the catastrophe bonds for the year ended december  was due to a million loss on one catastrophe bond with exposure to the earthquake and tsunami in japan 
during the second quarter of  we disposed of all remaining catastrophe bond holdings 
at december   we had million invested in catastrophe bonds  with a par value of million 
the increase in fair value of the catastrophe bonds was million during the year ended december  as of december   we held an index linked structured deposit 
the deposit has a guaranteed minimum redemption amount of million and a scheduled redemption date of december  changes in the fair value of the structured deposit were due entirely to changes in the reference index 
net realized and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale and trading securities 
our total fixed maturities portfolio is split into three portfolios an available for sale portfolio  a held to maturity portfolio  and a trading portfolio 
our available for sale portfolio is recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income as part of total shareholders equity 
our available for sale fixed maturities investment strategy is not intended to generate significant realized gains and losses as more fully discussed below in the financial condition section 
our held to maturity portfolio includes securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity or redemption  and is recorded at amortized cost 
there should be no realized gains or losses related to this portfolio unless there is an other than temporary impairment loss 
our trading portfolio is recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in net income 
net realized and unrealized gains on our fixed maturities portfolios for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
net impairment losses recognized in earnings 
as a result of our quarterly review of securities in an unrealized loss position  we recorded otti losses through earnings for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
these impairment losses are presented separately from all other net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments 
a discussion of our process for estimating otti is included in note of our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
financial condition cash and invested assets 
aggregate invested assets  comprising cash and cash equivalents  fixed maturities and other investments  were  million as of december  compared to  million as of december   a decrease of 
the modest decrease in cash and invested assets resulted principally from the combination of the timing of the settlement of premiums and losses  growth in our available for sale portfolio  partially offset by smaller held to maturity and other investment portfolios  foreign exchange losses on the held to maturity portfolio  and payments for share repurchases and dividends 
we hold an available for sale portfolio  a trading portfolio and a held to maturity portfolio of fixed maturities securities 
in an effort to match the expected cash flow requirements of our long term liabilities  we invest a portion of our fixed maturity investments in long duration securities 
because we intend to hold a number of these long duration securities to maturity  we classify these securities as held to maturity in our consolidated balance sheet 
this held to maturity portfolio is recorded at amortized cost 
as a result  we do not record changes in the fair value of this portfolio  which should reduce the impact on shareholders equity of fluctuations in fair value of those investments 

table of contents fixed maturities are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in interest rates  changes in issuer specific circumstances  such as credit rating changes  and changes in industry specific circumstances  such as movements in credit spreads based on the market s perception of industry risks 
as a result of these fluctuations  it is possible to have significant unrealized gains or losses on a security 
our strategy for our fixed maturities portfolios is to tailor the maturities of the portfolios to the timing of expected loss and benefit payments 
at maturity  absent any credit loss  a fixed maturity s amortized cost will equal its fair value and no realized gain or loss will be recognized in income 
if  due to an unforeseen change in loss payment patterns  we need to sell available for sale fixed maturity securities before maturity  we could realize significant gains or losses in any period  which could result in a meaningful effect on reported net income for such period 
in order to reduce the likelihood of needing to sell investments before maturity  especially given the unpredictable and potentially significant cash flow requirements of our property catastrophe business  we maintain significant cash and cash equivalent balances 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell those fixed maturities securities in an unrealized loss position until such time as they reach maturity or the fair value increases 
we perform regular reviews of our fixed maturities portfolio and utilize a process that considers numerous indicators in order to identify investments that show signs of potential other than temporary impairments 
the indicators include the issuer s financial condition and ability to make future scheduled interest and principal payments  benchmark yield spreads  the nature of collateral or other credit support and significant economic events that have occurred that affect the industry in which the issuer participates 
our fixed maturity portfolio comprises high quality  liquid securities 
as of december   our fixed maturities investments had a dollar weighted average credit rating of aa aa 
under our fixed maturities investment guidelines  a minimum weighted average credit rating of aa aa  or its equivalent  must be maintained for our fixed maturities investment portfolio as a whole 
our fixed maturities investment guidelines also provide that we cannot leverage our fixed maturities investments 
further details of the credit ratings on our fixed maturities investments are included in note of our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
our portfolio of fixed maturities includes mortgage backed and asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
these types of securities have cash flows that are backed by the principal and interest payments of a group of underlying mortgages or other receivables 
as a result of the increasing default rates of borrowers  there currently is a greater risk of defaults on mortgage backed and asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations than historically existed  especially those that are non investment grade 
these factors make estimating the fair value of these securities more uncertain 
we obtain fair value estimates from multiple independent pricing sources in an effort to mitigate some of the uncertainty surrounding the fair value estimates 
if we need to liquidate these securities within a short period of time  the actual realized proceeds may be significantly different from the fair values estimated as of december  we performed a review of securities in an unrealized loss position as of december  for otti  which included the consideration of relevant factors  including prepayment rates  subordination levels  default rates  credit ratings  weighted average life and cash flow testing 
together with our investment managers  we continue to monitor our potential exposure to mortgage backed and asset backed securities  and we will make adjustments to the investment portfolio  if and when we deem necessary 
as a result of this process  we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge through net income of million during the year ended december  we continue to monitor the ongoing uncertainty over the financial health of certain european governments and european financial institutions and our exposure to the credit risk of these investments 
as of december   we hold european government securities with a fair value of million  distributed as follows as of december  fair value of total in millions of us dollars france germany netherlands ireland belgium united kingdom denmark all other european countries european government holdings

a discussion of our process for estimating otti is included in note of our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
potential risks associated with sovereign debt of european union member states and euro denominated investments are discussed in item a risk factors the financial crisis in europe  including the threat of default on european sovereign debt  the devaluation of the euro and the dissolution of the european union  could adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
as described in note of our audited consolidated financial statements  our available for sale and trading fixed maturities investments and the majority of our other investments are carried at fair value 
fair value prices for all securities in our fixed maturities portfolio are independently provided by our investment custodians  our investment accounting service provider and our investment managers  with each utilizing internationally recognized independent pricing services 
we record the unadjusted price provided by the investment custodian  investment accounting service provider or investment manager after validating the prices 
our validation process includes i comparison of prices between two independent sources  with significant differences requiring additional price sources  ii quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark  with significant differences identified and investigated  iii evaluation of methodologies used by external parties to calculate fair value  including a review of the inputs used for pricing  and iv comparing the price to our knowledge of the current investment market 
the independent pricing services used by our investment custodians  investment accounting service provider and investment managers obtain actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
each pricing service has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded 
in general  these methods involve the use of matrix pricing in which the independent pricing service uses observable market inputs including  but not limited to  reported trades  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates and such other inputs as are available from market sources to determine a reasonable fair value 
in addition  pricing services use valuation models  such as an option adjusted spread model  to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the option adjusted spread model is commonly used to estimate fair value for securities such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the ability to obtain quoted market prices is reduced in periods of decreasing liquidity  which generally increases the use of matrix pricing methods and the uncertainty surrounding the fair value estimates 
investments in hedge funds comprise a portfolio of limited partnerships and stock investments in trading entities  or funds  which invest in a wide range of financial products 
the units of account that we value are our interests in the funds and not the underlying holdings of such funds 
as a result  the inputs we use to value our investments in each of the funds may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of such funds 
these funds are stated at fair value  which ordinarily will be the most recently reported net asset value as advised by the fund manager or administrator  where the fund s underlying holdings can be in various quoted and unquoted investments 
we believe the reported net asset value represents the fair value market participants would apply to an interest in the fund 
the fund managers value their underlying investments at fair value in accordance with policies established by each fund  as described in each of their financial statements and offering memoranda 

table of contents we have designed ongoing due diligence processes with respect to funds in which we invest and their managers 
these processes are designed to assist us in assessing the quality of information provided by  or on behalf of  each fund and in determining whether such information continues to be reliable or whether further review is necessary 
while reported net asset value is the primary input to the review  when the net asset value is deemed not to be indicative of fair value  we may incorporate adjustments to the reported net asset value 
these adjustments may involve significant judgment 
we obtain the audited financial statements for every fund annually and regularly review and discuss the fund performance with the fund managers to corroborate the reasonableness of the reported net asset values 
we are able to redeem the hedge fund portfolio on the same terms that the underlying funds can be liquidated 
in general  the funds in which we are invested require at least days notice of redemption  and may be redeemed on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual  annual or longer basis  depending on the fund 
certain funds in which we invest have a lock up period 
a lock up period refers to the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to invest before having the ability to redeem 
funds that provide for periodic redemptions may  depending on the funds governing documents  have the ability to deny or delay a redemption request  called a gate 
the fund may implement this restriction because the aggregate amount of redemption requests as of a particular date exceeds a specified level  generally ranging from to of the fund s net assets 
the gate is a method for executing an orderly redemption process  which allows for redemption requests to be executed in a timely manner to reduce the possibility of adversely affecting the remaining investors in the fund 
the majority of our hedge fund portfolio is redeemable within one year  and the imposition of gates by certain funds is not expected to significantly impact our cash flow needs 
based upon information provided by the fund managers  as of december   we estimate that over of the underlying assets held by our hedge fund portfolio are traded securities or have broker quotes available 
typically  the imposition of a gate delays a portion of the requested redemption  with the remaining portion settled in cash shortly after the redemption date 
of our december  outstanding redemptions receivable of million  none of which are gated  million was received in cash prior to february  the fair value of our holdings in funds with gates imposed as of december  was million 
certain funds may be allowed to invest a portion of their assets in illiquid securities  such as private equity and convertible debt 
in such cases  a common mechanism used is a side pocket  whereby the illiquid security is assigned to a separate memorandum capital account or designated account 
typically  the investor loses its redemption rights to the designated account 
only when the illiquid security is sold  or otherwise deemed liquid by the fund  may investors redeem their interest 
as of december   the fair value of our hedge funds held in side pockets was million 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the redemption of the underlying assets within funds with gates and side pockets  we have included these funds in the greater than days category in the table below 
if we requested full redemptions for all of our holdings in the funds  the table below indicates our best estimate of the earliest date from december  on which such redemptions might be received 
this estimate is based on available information from the funds and is subject to significant change 
as of december  fair value of hedge fund portfolio in millions of us dollars liquidity within days between to days between to days greater than days total hedge funds although we believe that our significant cash balances  fixed maturities investments and credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy the claims of insureds and ceding clients  in the event that we were required to access assets invested in the hedge fund investment portfolio  our ability to do so may be limited by these liquidity constraints 
additional information about the hedge fund portfolio can be found in notes and to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

table of contents we also hold an index linked structured deposit 
the deposit has a guaranteed minimum redemption value of million and a scheduled redemption date of december  the interest earned on the deposit is a function of the performance of the reference index over the term of the deposit 
losses and benefits recoverable from reinsurers 
losses and benefits recoverable from reinsurers totaled  million as of december  compared to million as of december   an increase of 
this increase resulted principally from recoveries on losses for the significant catastrophes during the year and additional losses ceded under our reinsurance and retrocessional agreements resulting from net earned premiums during the year ended december  losses recoverable from reinsurers on property and casualty business were  million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
benefits recoverable from reinsurers on life and annuity business were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
as of december   of our losses and benefits recoverable were with reinsurers rated a or above by am best  were rated a and the remaining were with nr not rated reinsurers 
grand central re  a bermuda domiciled reinsurance company in which alterra bermuda has a equity investment  is our largest nr not rated retrocessionaire and accounted for of our losses and benefits recoverable as of december  as security for outstanding loss obligations  we retain funds from grand central re amounting to of its loss recoverable obligations 
of the remaining amounts with nr not rated retrocessionaires we retain collateral equal to of the losses and benefits recoverable 
our losses and benefits recoverable are not due for payment until the underlying loss has been paid 
as of december   of our losses and benefits recoverable were not due for payment 
liabilities for property and casualty losses 
property and casualty losses totaled  million as of december  compared to  million as of december   an increase of 
during the year ended december   we incurred gross losses of  million  we paid million in property and casualty losses and we recorded gross favorable development on prior year reserves of million 
net of reinsurance  we paid million in property and casualty losses during the year ended december  liabilities for life and annuity benefits 
life and annuity benefits totaled  million as of december  compared to  million as of december  the decrease was principally attributable to movements in foreign exchange rates 
we endeavor to match these liabilities with assets of similar currency and duration in order to limit the net impact to shareholders equity of movements in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  we paid million of benefit payments during the year ended december  senior notes 
on september   alterra finance  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of alterra  issued million principal amount of senior notes due september  with interest payable on march and september of each year 
the senior notes are alterra finance s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of alterra finance s future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and rank senior to all of alterra finance s future subordinated indebtedness 
the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alterra on a senior unsecured basis 
the guarantee ranks equally with all of alterra s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and ranks senior to all of alterra s future subordinated indebtedness 
the effective interest rate related to the senior notes  based on the net proceeds received  was 
the proceeds  net of all issuance costs  from the sale of the senior notes were million and were used to repay a million revolving bank loan outstanding under a credit facility  that was subsequently replaced in december of  with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes 
on april   alterra usa privately issued million principal amount of senior notes due april  with interest payable on april and october of each year 
the senior notes are alterra usa s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of alterra usa 
the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alterra 
following repurchases of million and million principal amount in december and december  respectively  the principal amount of the senior notes outstanding as of december  was million 
the net proceeds for the sale of the senior notes were used to repay a bank loan used to acquire alterra e s 
shareholders equity 
our shareholders equity decreased to  million as of december  from  million as of december   a decrease of  principally due to the repurchase of million of common shares and the declaration of dividends of million  partially offset by net income of million in the year ended december  in addition  we recorded an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of million  principally from an increase in net unrealized gains on investments 
liquidity 
we generated million of cash from operations during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the two principal factors that impact our operating cash flow are premium collections and timing of loss and benefit payments 

table of contents our casualty business generally has a long claim tail 
as a result  we expect that we will generate significant operating cash flow as we accumulate property and casualty loss reserves on our balance sheet 
our property business generally has a short claim tail 
consequently  we expect volatility in our operating cash flow levels as losses are incurred 
we believe that our property and casualty loss reserves and life and annuity benefit reserves currently have an average duration of approximately years 
we expect increases in the amount of expected loss payments in future periods with a resulting decrease in operating cash flow  however  we do not expect loss payments to exceed the premiums generated 
actual premiums written and collected and losses and loss expenses paid in any period could vary materially from our expectations and could have a significant and adverse effect on operating cash flow 
while we tailor our fixed maturities portfolios in an effort to match the duration of expected loss and benefit payments  increased loss amounts or settlement of losses and benefits earlier than anticipated can result in greater cash needs 
we maintain a significant working cash balance and have generated positive cash flow from operations in each of our last eight years of operating history 
we also have the ability to borrow an additional million using our current credit facilities  subject to certain conditions 
our largest credit facility  a  million four year secured facility  expires in december our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december  we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to cover existing requirements and provide for contingent liquidity 
nonetheless  significant deviations in expected loss and benefit payments can occur  potentially requiring us to liquidate a portion of our fixed maturities portfolios 
if we need to liquidate our fixed maturities securities within a short period of time  the actual realized proceeds may be significantly different from the fair values estimated as of december  we believe that our portfolio has sufficient liquidity to mitigate this risk  and we believe that we can continue to hold any potentially illiquid position until we can initiate an appropriately priced transaction 
as a holding company  alterra s principal asset is its investment in the common shares of its principal operating subsidiary  alterra bermuda 
alterra s principal source of funds is from interest income on cash balances and cash dividends from its subsidiaries  including alterra bermuda 
the payment of dividends by alterra bermuda is limited under bermuda insurance laws 
in particular  alterra bermuda may not declare or pay any dividends if it is in breach of its minimum solvency or liquidity levels under bermuda law or if the declaration or payment of the dividends would cause it to fail to meet the minimum solvency or liquidity levels under bermuda law 
as of december   alterra bermuda met all minimum solvency and liquidity requirements 
alterra bermuda returned million of capital and surplus to alterra during the year ended december  through dividends and distribution of additional paid in capital 
alterra re usa may not pay dividends without the consent of the connecticut insurance commissioner until may  in the ordinary course of business  we are required to provide letters of credit or other regulatory approved security to certain of our clients to meet contractual and regulatory requirements 
during the year ended december  we replaced our million five year credit facility and our million five year credit facility with a  million four year credit facility 
as of december   we had two us dollar denominated letter of credit facilities totaling  million with an additional million available  subject to certain conditions 
on that date  we had million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities 
we had a british pound sterling  or gbp  denominated letter of credit facility of gbp million million to support our london branch of alterra europe  of which gbp million million was utilized as of december  we also had a gbp denominated letter of credit facility of gbp million million which was used to support our funds at lloyd s commitments but is no longer being used for this purpose and is scheduled to expire in june each of our credit facilities requires that we comply with certain financial covenants  which may include covenants related to maximum debt to capital ratio  minimum consolidated tangible net worth  minimum insurer financial strength rating and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of each of our credit facilities as of december  as of december   we provided million in funds at lloyd s 
these amounts are not available for distribution for the payment of dividends 
our funds at lloyd s commitments are met using cash and fixed maturity securities 
our corporate members may also be required to maintain funds under the control of lloyd s in excess of their capital requirements and such funds also may not be available for distribution or the payment of dividends 
capital resources 
as of december   total shareholders equity was  million compared to  million as of december   a decrease of 
on may   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s file no

the senior notes are guaranteed by alterra 
in april  alterra usa issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due april   of which million principal amount was outstanding as of december  the senior notes are guaranteed by alterra 
we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our foreseeable financial obligations 

table of contents we may repurchase our shares from time to time through the open market  privately negotiated transactions or rule b stock trading plans

contractual obligations contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years expressed in millions of us dollars senior notes operating lease obligations property and casualty losses life and annuity benefits deposit liabilities total the reserves for losses and benefits together with deposit liabilities represent management s estimate of the ultimate cost of settling losses  benefits and deposit liabilities 
as more fully discussed in critical accounting policies reserve for property and casualty losses and life and annuity reinsurance benefit reserves above  the estimation of losses and benefits is based on various complex and subjective judgments 
actual losses and benefits paid may differ  perhaps significantly  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
similarly  the timing of payment of our estimated losses and benefits is not fixed and there may be significant changes in actual payment activity 
the assumptions used in estimating the likely payments due by period are based on our historical claims payment experience and industry payment patterns  but due to the inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of such payments  there is a risk that the amounts paid in any such period can be significantly different from the amounts disclosed above 
the amounts in the above table represent our gross estimates of known liabilities as of december  and do not include any allowance for claims for future events within the time period specified 
accordingly  it is highly likely that the total amounts paid out in the time periods shown will be greater than those indicated in the table 
furthermore  life and annuity benefits and deposit liabilities recorded in the audited consolidated financial statements as of december  are computed on a net present value basis  whereas the expected payments by period in the table above are the estimated payments at a future time and do not reflect a discount of the amount payable 

table of contents non gaap financial measures in this annual report on form k  we have presented net operating income and net operating return on average shareholders equity  which are non gaap financial measures as defined in regulation g 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures  which may be defined differently by other companies  allow for a more complete understanding of the performance of our business 
these measures  however  should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with us gaap 
a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures to their respective most directly comparable us gaap financial measures is as follows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  expressed in millions of us dollars  except share and per share amou nts net income net realized and unrealized losses gains on non hedge fund investments  net of tax a net foreign exchange gains losses  net of tax merger and acquisition expenses  net of tax net operating income net income per diluted share net realized and unrealized losses gains on a non hedge fund investments  net of tax net foreign exchange losses  net of tax merger and acquisition expenses  net of tax net operating income per diluted share weighted average common shares outstanding basic weighted average common shares outstanding diluted average shareholders equity b return on average shareholders equity net operating return on average shareholders equity per share totals may not add due to rounding 
a net realized and unrealized losses gains on non hedge fund investments includes realized and unrealized gains losses on trading securities  realized gains losses on available for sale securities  net impairment losses recognized in earnings  income from equity method investments and change in fair value of investment derivatives  catastrophe bonds and structured deposits 
b average shareholders equity is computed as the average of the quarterly average shareholders equity balances 
the average for the year ended december  has been weighted to include harbor point from may   the date of the consummation of the amalgamation 
we believe that net operating income provides a better indication of management performance than net income as realized and unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities may fluctuate from period to period and foreign exchange gains and losses are typically outside the control of management 
merger and acquisition expenses are not indicative of expenses fundamental to the business and may fluctuate from period to period 
we believe that net operating return on average shareholders equity allows management to assess how the company has performed in terms of wealth generated for our shareholders 
new accounting pronouncements asu  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements accounting standards update  or asu  requires additional disclosure  and clarifies existing disclosure requirements  about fair value measurements 
the additional requirements include disclosure regarding the amounts and reasons for significant transfers in and out of level and of the fair value hierarchy and also separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of items measured using significant unobservable inputs ie level 
the guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall in either level or level of the hierarchy 
the requirements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have reflected the disclosure requirements effective for the current period in the consolidated financial statements and they did not have a material impact 
asu  receivables disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses asu requires additional disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and allowances for credit losses 
the additional requirements include disclosure of the nature of credit risks inherent in financing receivables  how credit risk is analyzed and assessed when determining the allowance for credit losses  and the reasons for the change in the allowance for credit losses 
the disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  we have reflected the disclosure requirements effective for the current period in the consolidated financial statements and they have not had a material impact 

table of contents asu  financial services insurance accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts asu specifies how insurance companies should recognize costs that meet the definition of acquisition costs as defined by usgaap 
asu modifies the existing guidance to require that only costs that are associated with the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract should be capitalized as deferred acquisition costs 
costs that fall outside the proposed definition  such as indirect costs or salaries related to unsuccessful efforts  should be expensed as incurred 
asu is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december  with prospective or retrospective application permitted 
we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
asu  comprehensive income asu requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
this eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
companies are also required to present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
asu is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december  with early adoption permitted 
the requirement to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements has been deferred and no effective date has been determined 
we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we engage in an investment strategy that combines a fixed maturities investment portfolio and a hedge fund portfolio that employs various strategies to manage investment risk 
we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity in our cash and fixed maturities investment portfolio to fund operations  pay insurance and reinsurance liabilities and claims and provide funding for unexpected events 
we seek to manage our credit risk through industry and issuer diversification  and interest rate risk by monitoring the duration and structure of our investment portfolio relative to the duration and structure of our liabilities 
we are exposed to potential loss from various market risks  primarily changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by these changes 
we manage our market risk based on board approved investment policies 
with respect to our fixed maturities investment portfolio  our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of investment grade issuers with limited and specific exceptions and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
we select investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that are tailored to the cash flow characteristics of our property and casualty and life and annuity liabilities 
as of december   of the securities held in our fixed maturities portfolio  by carrying value  were rated baa bbb or above 
as of december   the weighted average credit rating of our fixed maturities portfolio was aa aa 
under our current fixed maturities investment guidelines  securities in our fixed maturities portfolio  when purchased  generally must have a minimum rating of baa bbb  or its equivalent  from at least one internationally recognized statistical rating organization 
our guidelines permit three of our investment managers managing approximately of our invested assets by fair value as of december  to follow an opportunistic strategy  allowing them to purchase securities below investment grade  however  no more than of their holdings may be rated below b b 
in addition  a minimum weighted average credit quality rating of aa aa  or its equivalent  must be maintained for our fixed maturities investment portfolio as a whole 
as of december   the impact on the fixed maturities investment portfolio from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in fair value of  or approximately million  and the impact on the fixed maturities investment portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in fair value of  or approximately million 
with respect to our hedge fund portfolio  we monitor the strategies and funds in which we are invested 
we focus on risk as well as return in the selection of each of our hedge fund portfolio investments 
we select individual hedge funds that have exhibited attractive risk reward characteristics and low correlation to other investments in the portfolio  as opposed to individual investments that have shown the highest return  but also higher volatility of return 
we then combine the selected individual hedge funds into a portfolio of hedge funds 
by combining investments that we believe have moderate volatility and low correlations  we aim to achieve a hedge fund portfolio that has overall lower volatility relative to investing in a common stock portfolio or a typical fund of hedge funds portfolio 
as of december   the estimated impact on the hedge fund portfolio from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in fair value of  or approximately million  and the impact on the hedge fund portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated 
table of contents increase in fair value of  or approximately million 
another method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is value at risk  or var 
var is a statistical risk measure  calculating the level of potential losses that could be expected to be exceeded  over a specified holding period and at a given level of confidence  in normal market conditions  and is expressed as a percentage of the portfolio s initial value 
since the var approach is based on historical positions and market data  var results should not be viewed as an absolute and predictive gauge of future financial performance or as a way for us to predict risk 
as of december   our hedge fund portfolio s var was estimated to be at the level of confidence and with a three month time horizon
