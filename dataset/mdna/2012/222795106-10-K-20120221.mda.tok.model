item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview of performance and company and industry trends the company entered having stabilized its financial condition by reducing its leverage ratios and by beginning the process of simplifying its business platform through the sale of non core holdings 
overall  the economies in the company s core markets appeared to have stabilized but were not showing signs of any significant recovery 
in light of these conditions  management set goals for that included leasing vacant space in the company s operating properties  selling non core assets and seeking investment opportunities where its leasing and development expertise could enhance value over time  including operationally and financially distressed assets 
the company was successful in meeting these goals and management believes that the company is appropriately positioned for the future 
with respect to the company s leasing activities  the company began with of its office portfolio leased  but with of its square footage expiring in in spite of these expirations  the company was able to maintain its current office percent leased at at year end excluding the newly acquired promenade 
this result is a function of the company leasing or renewing approximately million square feet of office space in in its wholly owned and joint venture properties in a still challenged leasing environment 
the company continues to show strong leasing performance in its markets relative to its size and market share 
immediately prior to the company s acquisition of promenade  the company s average percent leased in its three core submarkets of atlanta buckhead  midtown and downtown was approximately versus an average market rate of 
the company s assets in austin and charlotte are close to leased versus overall market percentages of between and  respectively 
of the new leases signed in atlanta in  the company obtained a higher percentage than its relative market share 
while base rents for office space have deteriorated only marginally in the recent economic downturn  concessions in the form of free rent and tenant allowances have increased significantly 
in the atlanta market  rates and concessions have stabilized  but management does not believe that there will be significant improvement until employment in atlanta  which is running below the national average  improves 
the company s north carolina markets are mixed  as they are being negatively impacted by employment contraction in the banking sector  but positively impacted by the region s exposure to the education  technology and health services industries 
the company s texas markets  by contrast  have experienced positive job growth and lease absorption  resulting in a decline in lease concessions and an increase in rental rates 
the company s retail portfolio has increased from percent leased at the beginning of to at year end 
the company has been able to maintain and increase the percent leased of its retail properties in spite of consumer spending on discretionary consumer services being at a low rate relative to previous recoveries 
in addition to executing a new   square foot lease with academy sports at the avenue forsyth  the company s retail team renewed leases of a number of national tenants  including gap  chico s and ann taylor as well as stein mart at greenbrier marketcenter 
in the recent periods of economic downturn and uncertainty  the company s retail portfolio experienced base rental rate erosion  an increase in the number of tenants paying percentage rent in lieu of base rent  and higher allowances for tenant construction 
recently  the company has seen an improvement in tenant sales and a modest increase in expansion plans by some national retailers 
as a result  terms for new leases executed in the last half of were generally more traditional in nature as they predominately included standard base rent clauses and tenant construction allowances more in line with the structure of those seen prior to the downturn  although at lower rental rates 
management expects this trend to carry forward provided consumer confidence and associated consumer spending in each of its submarkets improves 
while the company had success with its leasing activities in  it also made progress on its goal of simplifying its business structure by selling non core assets thereby generating additional capital for investment 
during the year  the company exited the condominium business by selling the last five units at its terminus project 
it substantially exited the industrial business by selling jefferson mill business park building a jefferson mill  king mill distribution park building king mill and lakeside 
table of contents ranch business park building lakeside  and the industrial land in texas 
the company reduced its holdings of other land by selling acres and continued to decrease its holdings of residential lots by selling lots  the most since in addition  the company sold one georgia center  a year old building in downtown atlanta  the majority of which was leased by the georgia department of transportation 
as a result of these activities  the company generated million in proceeds for reinvestment 
to further simplify its business model to focus on class a office properties  the company has changed its strategy on certain land and residential holdings  as well as several other non core assets  to more aggressively liquidate these assets 
instead of holding these assets for long term investment or future development  the company intends to sell these assets in bulk over a shorter time frame than previously intended 
as a result of this change  the company recorded impairment losses of million in the fourth quarter of in addition  after the end of  the company entered into a contract to sell the majority of the residential projects owned in two joint ventures to its joint venture partner 
the company also expects to sell in bulk the assets related to other residential projects  thereby effectively exiting the residential development business 
from this strategy shift  the company expects it will generate proceeds from asset sales over time 
also  its estimated future capital outlays for development and for holding costs on these assets will be significantly reduced or eliminated 
with the additional proceeds generated in from asset sales  the company was able to achieve another of its goals for to invest in assets in its core markets that management expects to add value over time 
the most significant of these investments was the acquisition of promenade  a  square foot class a office building in the midtown submarket of atlanta 
upon acquisition  the building was leased and is  in management s judgment  well located in one of the most desirable sub markets in metropolitan atlanta 
the company expects its relationships with top tier atlanta companies and its reputation for providing superior property management services will generate leasing momentum for the building s vacant space 
the company has already capitalized on its strengths by leasing  square feet since acquisition  bringing the building to leased 
the company also commenced two development projects in the emory point phase i project is a mixed use development adjacent to emory university and the centers for disease control that is expected to contain apartment units and  square feet of retail space 
the company obtained this opportunity through its relationship with emory university and is constructing the project in a joint venture with apartment developer gables residential 
the project is located in what management believes to be a high barrier to entry submarket with high demand for housing  restaurants and other retail from students and employees of emory university and centers for disease control 
the company also began work on mahan village  a  square foot retail center  anchored by publix and academy sports  in tallahassee  florida  which was leased prior to commencement 
the company obtained this opportunity when the existing developer needed assistance with financing 
during  the company invested million in these three acquisition and development projects and expects to invest an additional million  net of construction loans  in emory point and mahan village in future years 
beyond  the company plans to continue to simplify its business model and to move toward holding substantially all of its assets in class a office properties 
the company expects most of these assets will be located in its core markets of georgia  texas and north carolina 
the company will continue to prefer investment opportunities that are financially or operationally distressed  thereby creating opportunities to add value through its leasing  asset management and development teams 
in addition  the company could acquire stable operating office properties in order to achieve strategic objectives 
there is no guarantee that management will be able to achieve its goals  which could have an adverse impact on its results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as outlined in the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification asc  and the notes to consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies for the company 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of certain estimates  a change in which could materially 
table of contents affect revenues  expenses  assets or liabilities 
some of the company s accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  which are ones that are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and ones that also require significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows long lived assets cost capitalization 
the company is involved in all stages of real estate ownership  including development 
prior to the point a project becomes probable of being developed defined as more likely than not  the company expenses predevelopment costs 
after management determines the project is probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized in accordance with accounting rules 
if the company abandons development of a project that had earlier been deemed probable  the company charges all previously capitalized costs to expense 
if this occurs  the company s predevelopment expenses could rise significantly in that period because all capitalized predevelopment costs associated with that project would be charged to expense in the period that this change occurs 
the determination of whether a project is probable requires judgment by management 
if management determines that a project is probable  interest  general and administrative and other expenses could be materially different than if management determines the project is not probable 
during both the predevelopment period and the period in which a project is under construction  the company capitalizes all direct and indirect costs associated with planning  developing  leasing and constructing the project 
determination of what costs constitute direct and indirect project costs requires management  in some cases  to exercise judgment 
if management determines certain costs to be direct or indirect project costs  amounts recorded in projects under development on the balance sheet and amounts recorded in general and administrative and other expenses on the statement of operations could be materially different than if management determines these costs are not directly or indirectly associated with the project 
once a project is constructed and deemed substantially complete and held for occupancy  subsequent carrying costs  such as real estate taxes  interest  internal personnel and associated costs  are expensed as incurred 
determination of when construction of a project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy requires judgment 
the company considers projects and or project phases substantially complete and held for occupancy at the earlier of the date on which the project or phase reached occupancy of or one year from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
the company s judgment of the date the project is substantially complete has a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and net income for the period 
operating property acquisitions 
from time to time  the company acquires operating properties 
the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of operating property acquisitions are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
fair value is based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize available market information and discount and or capitalization rates as appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the acquired assets and assumed liabilities for an acquired operating property generally include  but are not limited to land  buildings  and identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities associated with in place leases  including tenant improvements  leasing costs  value of above market and below market leases  and acquired in place lease values 
the fair value of land is derived from comparable sales of land within the same submarket and or region 
the fair value of buildings  tenant improvements  and leasing costs are based upon current market replacement costs and other relevant market rate information 
the fair value of the above market or below market component of an acquired in place lease is based upon the present value calculated using a market discount rate of the difference between i the contractual rents to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the rents that would be paid using fair market rental rates and rent escalations at the date of acquisition over the remaining term of the lease 
in place leases at acquired properties are reviewed at the time of acquisition to determine if contractual rents are above or below current market rents for the acquired property  and an identifiable intangible asset or liability is recorded if there is an above or below market lease 

table of contents the fair value of acquired in place leases is derived based on management s assessment of lost revenue and costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased 
this fair value is based on a variety of considerations including  but not necessarily limited to the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases  the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period  and the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period 
factors considered in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  such as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases  such as leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
the amounts recorded for above market and in place leases are included in other assets on the balance sheets  and the amounts for below market leases are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the balance sheets 
these amounts are amortized on a straight line basis as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining term of the applicable leases 
the determination of the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of operating property acquisitions requires significant judgments and assumptions about the numerous inputs discussed above 
the use of different assumptions in these fair value calculations could significantly affect the reported amounts of the allocation of the acquisition related assets and liabilities and the related amortization and depreciation expense recorded for such assets and liabilities 
in addition  since the value of above and below market leases are amortized as either a reduction or increase to rental income  respectively  the judgments for these intangibles could have a significant impact on reported rental revenues and results of operations 
depreciation and amortization 
the company depreciates or amortizes operating real estate assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses judgment when estimating the life of the real estate assets and when allocating certain indirect project costs to projects under development 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
if management incorrectly estimates the useful lives of the company s real estate assets or if cost allocations are not appropriate  then depreciation and amortization may not be reflected properly in the company s results of operations 
the company generally amortizes tenant costs over the lease term 
in certain situations  the tenant may not fulfill its commitments under its lease  and the estimated amortization period of those tenant assets could change  which would result in accelerated amortization of tenant costs or a change in the amortization period  thereby directly affecting the current year s net income 
impairment of long lived assets real estate assets 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews its real estate assets on a property by property basis for impairment 
this review includes the company s operating properties  the company s holdings of undeveloped land and the company s residential lot developments 
the first step in this process is for management to use judgment to determine whether an asset is considered to be held and used or held for sale  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
in order to be considered a long lived asset held for sale  management must  among other things  have the authority to commit to a plan to sell the asset in its current condition  have commenced the plan to sell the asset and have determined that it is probable that the asset will sell within one year 
if management determines that an asset is held for sale  it must record an impairment loss if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount 
all real estate assets not meeting the held for sale criteria are considered to be held and used 
in the impairment analysis for assets held and used  management must use judgment to determine whether there are indicators of impairment 
for operating properties  these indicators could include a decline in a property s leasing percentage  a current period operating loss or negative cash flows combined with a history of losses at the property  a decline on lease rates for that property or others in the property s market  or an adverse change in the financial condition of significant tenants 
for land holdings  indicators could include on overall decline in the market value of land in the region  a decline in development activity for the intended use of the land or other adverse economic and market conditions 
for residential lot developments  indicators could include a decline in the selling price of completed lots  an increase in inventory of residential lots in a particular project s market area  or other general adverse market conditions with respect to new home development and sale 

table of contents if management determines that an asset that is held and used has indicators of impairment  it must determine whether the future estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from that asset exceed the carrying amount of the asset 
if the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the company must reduce the carrying amount of the asset to fair value 
in calculating the undiscounted net cash flows of an asset  management must estimate a number of inputs 
for operating properties  management must estimate future rental rates  expenditures for future leases  future operating expenses  market capitalization rates for residual values  among other things 
for land holdings  management must estimate future development costs as well as operating income  expenses and residual capitalization rates for land held for future development 
management also must estimate future sales prices for land that it intends to hold for sale to a developer or for sale in a build to suit project 
for residential lot developments  management must estimate future sales prices  costs to complete development  carrying costs and other costs to complete the development 
in determining the fair value of an asset  management may use a discounted cash flow calculation or utilize comparable market information 
management must determine an appropriate discount rate to apply to the cash flows in the discounted cash flow calculation 
management must use judgment in analyzing comparable market information because no two real estate assets are identical in location and price 
the estimates and judgments used in the impairment process are highly subjective and susceptible to frequent change 
if management determines that an asset is held and used  the results of operations could be materially different than if it determines that an asset is held for sale 
different assumptions management uses in the calculation of undiscounted net cash flows of a project could cause a material impairment loss to be recognized when no impairment is otherwise warranted 
management s assumptions about the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow estimate of fair value and management s judgment with respect to market information could materially affect the decision to record impairment losses or  if required  the amount of the impairment losses 
impairment of long lived assets investments in joint ventures 
on a quarterly basis  management performs an impairment analysis of the recoverability of its investments in joint ventures in accordance with accounting rules 
this review includes management analyzing its investments in joint ventures for indicators of impairment 
if indicators of impairment are present for any of the company s investments in joint ventures  management calculates the fair value of the investment 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  management must determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary  as defined 
if management assesses the impairment to be temporary  the company does not record an impairment charge 
if management concludes that the impairment is other than temporary  the company records an impairment charge 
management uses considerable judgment in determining whether there are indicators of impairment present and in the assumptions  estimations and inputs used in calculating the fair value of the investment 
management also uses judgment in making the determination as to whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
the company utilizes guidance provided by the sec in making the determination of whether the impairment is temporary 
the guidance indicates that companies consider the length of time that the impairment has existed  the financial condition of the joint venture and the ability and intent of the holder to retain the investment long enough for a recovery in market value 
management s judgment as to the fair value of the investment or on the conclusion of the nature of the impairment could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
revenue recognition residential lot and certain land tract sales 
when selling lots or certain land tracts contained in an integrated residential development project  management records cost of sales based on a profit percentage 
this profit percentage is calculated based on the aggregate estimated sales prices for the overall development and the aggregate estimated costs for the overall development 
management must use significant judgment in determining the future estimated sales prices and costs 
markets for residential lots and land can change over time  and therefore  historical sales prices may not be indicative of a project s prices over its lifetime 
in 
table of contents addition  sales may not occur at a consistent or predictable rate 
this has been particularly true over the past several years in the residential real estate markets in which the company operates 
costs of a project may change over time  particularly if timing of sales changes and becomes extended 
management s judgment on the estimated selling prices  the estimated costs and the timing of projects could materially affect the amount the company records as its cost of sales on residential lots and certain land tracts 
valuation of receivables 
the company generates a significant percentage of its revenues from base rentals and expense reimbursements from tenant leases in office and retail properties 
in some cases  receivables are recognized for amounts due under leases or other contracts and agreements  which ultimately may not be collected 
the notes and other receivables line item on the balance sheet includes current tenant rent receivables and amounts deferred for tenant leases under the straight line method of accounting  and the balance is shown net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance to record against its receivables 
this review process requires management to make certain judgments regarding collectibility  notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
economic conditions fluctuate over time  and the company has tenants in various different industries which experience frequent changes in economic health  which makes historical information often not useful in predicting collectibility 
therefore certain receivables currently deemed collectible could become uncollectible  and those reserved could be ultimately collected 
a change in judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect on net income 
income taxes valuation allowance in accordance with accounting rules  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
the company periodically assesses the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires considerable judgment by management and includes  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  its experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives 
if management determines that the company requires a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets  income tax expense or benefit could be materially different than if management determines no such valuation allowance is necessary 
accounting for non wholly owned entities the company holds ownership interests in a number of joint ventures with varying structures 
management evaluates all of its joint ventures and other variable interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  as defined in accounting rules 
if the venture is a vie  and if management determines that the company is the primary beneficiary  the company consolidates the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie 
the company reassesses its conclusions as to whether the entity is a vie and whether consolidation is appropriate as required under the rules 
for entities that are not determined to be vies  management evaluates whether or not the company has control or significant influence over the joint venture to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation 
generally  entities under the company s control are consolidated  and entities over which the company can exert significant influence  but does not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
management uses judgment to determine whether an entity is a vie  whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie and whether the company exercises control over the entity 
if management determines that an entity is a vie with the company as primary beneficiary or if management concludes that the company exercises control over the entity  the balance sheet and statement of operations would be significantly different than if management concludes otherwise 
in addition  vies require different disclosures in the notes to the financial statements than entities that are not vies 
management may also change its conclusions  and thereby change its balance sheet  statement of operations and notes to the financial statements  based on facts and circumstances that arise after the original consolidation determination is made 
these changes could include additional equity contributed to entities  changes in the allocation of cash flow to entity partners and changes in the expected results within the entity 

table of contents discussion of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new guidance related to the presentation of other comprehensive income oci 
currently  the company includes components of oci in the statements of equity 
the new guidance requires  among other items  the presentation of the components of net income and oci in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  the company does not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations for the three years ended december  general 
the company s financial results have historically been significantly affected by sale transactions and the fees generated by  and start up operations of  real estate developments 
these types of transactions and developments do not necessarily recur 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future operating results

fee income 
the company generates fee income through the leasing  management and development of properties owned by joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest and from certain other third party owners outside of its cousins properties services cps subsidiary 
these amounts vary by years due to the development and leasing needs at the underlying properties and the mix of contracts with third parties 
amounts are expected to continue to vary in future years based on volume and composition 
fee income decreased approximately  between and this decrease is the result of a decrease in leasing fees of  mainly due to higher levels of leasing occurring at the palisades west llc and msref cousins terminus llc msref t ventures during  partially offset by fees received from the ten peachtree place associates and crawford long cpi  llc ventures in fee income increased million between and this increase is the result of an increase in leasing fees of approximately million  primarily due to leasing fees of approximately million recognized from the msref t venture formed in third party management and leasing revenues 
third party management and leasing revenues represent amounts recognized from contracts with the cps subsidiary  which performs management and leasing for certain third party owned office and retail properties 
management fees fluctuate based on the number and size of the properties within the cps portfolio 
leasing fees fluctuate based on the rollover activity at the underlying properties and the overall supply and demand for leased space within the individual markets 
these revenues  including expense reimbursements  did not change significantly between and between and  these revenues decreased approximately million  due to a drop in the average square feet managed between the years

additional information related to impairment losses 
most of the company s real estate assets are considered to be held for use pursuant to the accounting rules 
if management s strategy changes on any of these assets  the company may be required to record significant impairment charges in future periods 
changes that could cause these impairment losses include a decision by the company to sell the asset rather than hold for long term investment or development purposes  or changes in management s estimates of future cash flows from the assets that cause the future undiscounted cash flows to be less than the asset s carrying amount 
given the uncertainties with the economic environment and the amount of the company s land and residential lot holdings  management cannot predict whether or not the company will incur impairment losses in the future  and if impairment losses are recorded  management cannot predict the magnitude of such losses

therefore  prior year results change as a result of the reclassification of the operations of these properties into a separate section of the statements of operations entitled discontinued operations

funds from operations

ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for 
table of contents real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income
