item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations constitutes management s review of the factors that affected our financial and operating performance for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a development stage company and began the development of the mt 
hope project on october  during the year ended december  we also completed work on a pre feasibility study of our liberty property  which we updated during the development of the mt 
hope project has a project capital estimate of  million including development costs of approximately  million in dollars and million in cash financial assurance requirements and pre payments 
the project capital estimate is based on constant dollars and is subject to escalation 
we anticipate updating the project capital estimate later this year 
these amounts do not include financing costs or amounts necessary to fund operating working capital and potential capital overruns 
from october through the year ended december   we have spent approximately million on the mt 
hope project 
in  because of declining molybdenum prices and unanticipated delays in the mt 
hope project permitting process  we implemented a cash conservation plan whereby total cash utilization  other than equipment purchases and permitting efforts  was reduced to approximately million per month 
the company has maintained its orders for grinding  milling  and other specialty long lead equipment 
however  other engineering  administrative and third party work was slowed or suspended 
we restarted some procurement and engineering efforts in january following the publication of the deis and our belief that we are getting closer to the commencement of actual mt 
hope project construction 
the company had cash on hand as of december  of million to meet its funding requirements for based on our current cash on hand and our ongoing cash conservation plan  the company expects it will have adequate liquidity through the restart of the project and execution of the financing plan without needing to drawdown available funds from the second tranche of the bridge loan 
the worldwide molybdenum price fluctuated between per pound in to over per pound in and traded in the mid s per pound prior to october  when prices fell from approximately per pound to per pound in april as a result of the global economic collapse 
subsequent to april  prices slowly rose  finishing at per pound and further increasing to finish at per pound 
during  prices traded in a relatively narrow range between and per pound  finishing the year at per pound  according to ryan s notes 
since the beginning of  prices have traded slightly higher and are currently trading at per pound 

table of contents the permitting process for the mt 
hope project has also had an impact on our activities because of delays experienced from extensive regulatory reviews and additional requests for information on environmental impacts 
nevertheless  the process continues to move toward completion  and our efforts in this regard have continued full time 
once the major operating permits and the rod from the blm are effective  and financing is available  it is expected that mt 
hope can be constructed and in production within approximately months 
restructuring and suspension of project development as discussed above  in march  we implemented a cash conservation plan to reduce expenditures and conserve cash in order to maximize financial flexibility 
engineering efforts related to the mt 
hope project  which currently are approximately complete  were restarted in january following the publication of the deis 
as of march  the llc had purchase orders for mining and milling process equipment 
some orders for mining equipment were cancelled  while orders for electric shovels and haul trucks were modified to become cancellable or non binding 
most equipment orders for the custom built grinding and other milling process equipment are being completed by the manufacturers  and this equipment is being or will be stored pending commencement of construction 
the grinding and milling process equipment require the longest lead times and maintaining these orders is critical to the company s ability to rapidly restart the mt 
hope project development 
the llc completed negotiations with other equipment manufacturers to suspend or terminate fabrication of other milling equipment 
as funding becomes available and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under new market terms and conditions  as necessary 
based on our current plan  expected timetable  and the results of such negotiations  we expect to make additional payments on milling process equipment orders of approximately million in and million in for the gyratory crusher  sag and ball mills and related electric mill drives  and some other long lead equipment  we will own the equipment upon final payments forecasted to occur in and early also  at december   we have a contract to purchase two electric shovels that is cancellable  has no firm schedule of payments  and includes a million deposit that is forfeitable if an additional million deposit is not made by june  the llc continues to need this equipment for construction phase mine development and post construction mining  and is committed to either renegotiate the timing and amount of the contractual deposit terms to provide more payment flexibility or obtaining additional funding sources in order to make this payment without impacting our liquidity position 
on february  the llc issued a firm purchase order for haul trucks to cashman equipment company  the nevada based dealer for caterpillar 
the order provides for delivery of those haul trucks required to perform initial mine development  currently scheduled for the second half of a non refundable down payment of million was made at the time of order with an additional million due months prior to truck shipment  but the contract is cancellable with no further liability to the llc up until the time of truck shipment 
an additional haul trucks are not required until after the commencement of commercial production  and will be ordered at a future date 
the cash conservation plan reduced our total cash utilization for general administrative and overhead expenses to approximately million per month  inclusive of maintenance costs at the liberty property 
based on our current cash on hand and our cash conservation plan  the company expects it will have adequate liquidity through the restart of the project and execution of the financing plan 
the mt 
hope llc agreement effective as of january   we contributed all of our interest in the assets related to the mt 
hope project  including our lease of the mt 
hope project into a newly formed entity  eureka moly  llc  a delaware limited liability company llc  and in february closing date entered into an agreement llc agreement for the development and operation of the mt 
hope project with pos minerals corporation pos minerals an affiliate of posco  a large korean steel company 
under the llc agreement  pos minerals owns a interest in the llc and general moly  through a wholly owned subsidiary  owns an interest 
the ownership interests and or required contributions under the llc agreement can change as discussed below 
pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement  pos minerals made its first and second cash contributions to the llc totaling million during the year ended december  initial contributions 
additional amounts will be due from pos minerals within days after the date rod contribution date that specified conditions rod contribution conditions have been satisfied 
the rod contribution conditions are i the receipt of major operating permits for the mt 
hope project  ii confirmation that the record of decision rod from the united states bureau of land management 
table of contents blm for the mt 
hope project has become effective  and iii any administrative or judicial appeals with respect thereto are final 
we are currently targeting the effective date of the rod and the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions to occur between june and september however  circumstances beyond our control  including reviewing agency delays or requests for additional information or studies  and requests for review or appeals of the blm decision  could cause the effectiveness of the rod and or the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions to be delayed beyond that expected time 
once the rod is effective and financing is in place  we expect that production will begin approximately months following initiation of project construction 
to maintain its interest in the llc  pos minerals will be required to make an additional million contribution plus its share of all mt 
hope project costs incurred from the closing date to the rod contribution date within days after the rod contribution date 
if pos minerals does not make its additional million contribution when due after the rod contribution date  its interest will be reduced to 
in addition  as commercial production at the mt 
hope project was not achieved by december   the llc may be required to return to pos minerals million of its contributions to the llc  with no corresponding reduction in pos minerals ownership percentage 
based on our current plan and assuming pos minerals has made its additional million contribution within days after the rod contribution date  a payment to pos minerals of million will be due days after the commencement of commercial production  as defined in the llc agreement 
we currently anticipate such payment being made during if pos minerals does not make its additional million contribution when due  no return of contributions is required by us 
our wholly owned subsidiary and owner of the llc  nevada moly  llc nevada moly  is obligated under the terms of the llc agreement to make capital contributions to fund the return of contributions to pos minerals  if required 
if nevada moly does not make these capital contributions  pos minerals has an election to either make a secured loan to the llc to fund the return of contributions  or receive an additional interest in the llc of approximately 
in the latter case  our interest in the llc is subject to dilution by a percentage equal to the ratio of times the amount of the unpaid contributions over the aggregate amount of deemed capital contributions as determined under the llc agreement of both parties to the llc dilution formula 
at december   the aggregate amount of deemed capital contributions of both parties was million 
furthermore  the llc agreement permits pos minerals to put its interest in the llc to nevada moly after a change of control of nevada moly or the company  as defined in the llc agreement  followed by a failure to use standard mining industry practice in connection with development and operation of the mt 
hope project as contemplated by the parties for a period of twelve consecutive months 
if pos minerals puts its interest  nevada moly or its transferee or surviving entity would be required to purchase the interest for of pos minerals contributions to the llc plus interest per annum 
the initial contributions of million that were made by pos minerals during were expended by the second quarter of in accordance with the program and budget requirements of the mt 
hope project 
nevada moly is required  pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement  to advance funds required to pay costs for the development of the mt 
hope project that exceed the initial contributions until the rod contribution date  at which point the contributions described above to be made by pos minerals will be applied to reimburse us for pos minerals share of such development costs 
all costs incurred after the rod contribution date will be allocated and funded pro rata based on each party s ownership interest 
pos minerals share of such development costs amounted to approximately million as of december  the interest of a party in the llc that does not make its pro rata capital contributions to fund costs incurred after the rod contribution date is subject to dilution based on the dilution formula 
agreements with hanlong usa mining investment inc we have signed a series of agreements the hanlong transaction with hanlong usa mining investment  inc hanlong  an affiliate of sichuan hanlong group  a large privately held chinese company

hope project under certain circumstances  and on or before the date of commercial production  and hanlong exercises its rights to maintain its percentage interest  we will be obligated to refund to hanlong the cost of such shares over a three year period up to an aggregate of million 
break fees 
a break fee is payable by both the company and hanlong if the purchase agreement terminates because of the failure of certain conditions 
a break fee of million is payable to the company if the purchase agreement is terminated because hanlong fails to obtain necessary chinese government approvals  which may be offset against any balances owed by the company under the bridge loan 
a break fee of million is payable to hanlong if the rod is not timely received or the condition waived and the purchase agreement is terminated 
the company s break fee may be increased by million if the purchase agreement is terminated and the company has violated the no shop provisions of the purchase agreement

the term loan will bear interest at a rate tied to the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread of between and per annum 
the purchase agreement provides that the term loan will have customary covenants and conditions  however  the terms of the term loan have not yet been negotiated with the lender and we have no assurance as to 
table of contents the final terms of the term loan 
on february   the company announced china development bank cdb had confirmed the basic terms underlying a proposed million term loan to finance the mt 
hope project  including a cdb commitment to lend million and arrange a consortium of chinese and international banks to fund the balance 
the term loan is anticipated to carry a maturity of years including a month grace period to allow for the construction of the mt

if exercised  the parties will amend the bridge loan agreement to extend the maturity date of the bridge loan from december  until april  this option also has the effect of potentially extending the availability of the undrawn million second tranche to april  since the availability of the second tranche ends the earliest of the tranche closing date  the maturity date of the bridge loan  and the first borrowing under the term loan 
the outstanding balance of the bridge loan and related accrued interest are recorded as a current liability as of december  as the company anticipates the term loan will become available within the next twelve months 
the bridge loan and our obligation to pay a break fee to hanlong under the purchase agreement are secured by a pledge by us of a interest in the llc 
stockholder agreement in connection with hanlong s purchase of our shares  hanlong signed a stockholder agreement with the company that limits hanlong s future acquisitions of our common stock  provides for designation of up to two directors to our board and representation on the llc management committee  and places some restrictions on hanlong s voting and disposition of our shares 
after the tranche closing  hanlong became entitled to nominate one director to serve on our board and one representative to the llc management committee

pursuant to those rights  arcelormittal had an option to participate in the tranche and tranche equity issuances 
on april   the company and arcelormittal entered into a consent and waiver agreement the agreement whereby arcelormittal waived its anti dilution rights with respect to the company s proposed issuance of stock under the hanlong investment 
arcelormittal will retain anti dilution rights for future issuances of company stock outside of shares sold under the hanlong investment

liquidity  capital resources and capital requirements year ended december  compared to year ended december  our total consolidated cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash balances for the year ended december  was due primarily to development expenditures and debt issuance costs incurred of million  advance royalty payments of million  and general and administrative costs of million offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants 
deposits on property  plant and equipment relate primarily to scheduled payments for long lead time equipment for the mt 
hope project 
see contractual obligations below 
the majority of funds expended were used to advance the mt 
hope project 
total assets as of december  decreased to million compared to million as of december  primarily due to forfeited long term deposits on mining equipment of million with the passage of a june  deadline for a firm purchase order 
as discussed above under permitting and water rights update  we currently anticipate the effectiveness of the rod and the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions to occur between june and september  but circumstances beyond our control could cause the effectiveness of the rod and or the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions to be delayed 
as discussed above under securities purchase agreement with hanlong usa mining investment inc  we have signed a series of agreements with hanlong that form the basis of a significant investment by hanlong in the company that is intended to provide the company with adequate capital to develop the mt 
hope project 
on april   we drew down the first tranche of the bridge loan from hanlong in the amount of million 
on december   hanlong completed the purchase of of our fully diluted shares  or approximately million shares  for million 
with our cash conservation plan  our non equipment related cash requirements have declined to approximately million per month 
based on our current plan and expected timetable  we expect to make additional payments of approximately million under milling process equipment orders through the end of and million in as additional financing becomes available and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under current market terms and conditions  as necessary 
based on our project capital estimate we estimate that an additional million related to the construction royalty advance must be paid on or before october   which amount has been accrued 
accordingly  based on our current cash on hand and our ongoing cash conservation plan  the company expects it will have adequate liquidity through the restart of the project and execution of the financing plan without needing to drawdown available funds from the second tranche of the bridge loan 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the increase in our cash balances for the year ended december  was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of tranche equity to hanlong of million  million advanced under the bridge loan  and million from the exercise of outstanding warrants offset by development costs incurred of million  deposits on property  plant and equipment

the increase in costs compared to the previous year relates to work performed at the liberty project to update the pre feasibility study 
for the year ended december  and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december  the decrease in costs compared to the previous year were due primarily to lower costs associated with outside legal counsel 
for the year ended december  and  write downs of development and deposits were million and million  respectively 
these costs are due to forfeited long term deposits on mining equipment with the passage of a june  deadline for a firm purchase order  and the relinquishment of the annex lease to eureka county during the third quarter of  respectively

for the year ended december  the liberty remained on a care and maintenance status  and accordingly  the resulting exploration and evaluation expenses are considerable lower for the year 
for the year ended december  and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december  general and administrative costs were significantly higher than in as a greater amount of equity compensation was incurred as a result of the impact of increasing share prices on equity compensation plans and additional awards granted 
for the year ended december   write downs of development and deposits was million as a result of the company s relinquishment of a land lease held by the llc in eureka county  nevada 
the llc had invested million in preliminary development costs for the property covered by the lease 
as a result of the relinquishment  these costs were written off by the company

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows  based on permitting expectations payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations agricultural sustainability trust contributions equipment purchase contracts advance royalties and deferral fees provision for post closure reclamation and remediation total at december   the llc has a contract to purchase two electric shovels that is cancellable and has no firm schedule of payments 
we also had a non binding letter of agreement on haul trucks that establishes our priority for delivery 
both agreements provide for the then current pricing using market indices upon initiation of an order 
we have active orders with varying stages of fabrication on milling process equipment comprised of two kv primary transformers and substation  a primary crusher  a semi autogenous mill  two ball mills  and various motors for the mills 
we have suspended fabrication on flotation cells  lime slaking equipment  hydrocyclones  and other smaller milling process equipment with the ability to re initiate fabrication at any time 
the llc terminated the fabrication of two multi hearth molybdenum roasters and have received finished goods of the partially completed order 
the llc plans to re establish a new purchase order with this manufacturer as financing becomes available and equipment procurement is restarted under then current market terms and conditions 
on february  the llc issued a firm purchase order for haul trucks to cashman equipment company  the nevada based dealer for caterpillar 
the order provides for delivery of those haul trucks required to perform initial mine development  currently scheduled for the second half of a non refundable down payment of million was made at the time of order with an additional million due months prior to truck shipment  but the contract is cancellable with no further liability to the llc up until the time of truck shipment 
an additional haul trucks are not required until after the commencement of commercial production  and will be ordered at a future date 

table of contents the following table sets forth the llc s cash commitments under mining and milling equipment contracts collectively  purchase contracts at december  in millions period cash commitments under equipment purchase contracts as of december  st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total total if the company does not make payments required under the purchase contracts  it could be subject to claims for breach of contract or to cancellation of the purchase contract 
in addition  we may proceed to selectively suspend  cancel or attempt to renegotiate additional purchase contracts if we are forced to further conserve cash 
see liquidity  capital resources and capital requirements above 
if we cancel or breach any contracts  we will take all appropriate action to minimize any losses  but could be subject under the contracts or applicable law 
the cancellation of certain key contracts would cause a delay in the commencement of operations  have ramifications under the llc agreement with pos minerals and would add to the cost to develop our interest in the mt 
hope project 
obligations under capital and operating leases we have contractual obligations under capital and operating leases that will require a total of million in payments over the next three years 
assets under capital lease relate to light vehicles leased by the company for use in operations 
operating leases consist primarily of rents on office facilities and office equipment 
our expected payments are million  million  and nil for the years ended december   and  respectively 
creation of agricultural sustainability trust on august   the llc entered into an agreement with the eureka producers cooperative the epc whereby the llc will fund a sustainability trust the trust in exchange for the cooperation of the epc with respect to the llc s water rights and permitting of the mt 
hope project 
the trust will be tasked with developing and implementing programs that will serve to enhance the sustainability and well being of the agricultural economy in the diamond valley hydrographic basin through reduced water consumption  which may include the trust purchasing and relinquishing water rights in diamond valley to help bring the diamond valley basin into a more sustainable water balance 
the trust s activities will be governed by a five member board including one llc representative 
the trust may be funded by the llc over several years based on the achievement of certain milestones 
the achievement of these milestones is considered to be probable  and as such million is accrued in the company s december   financial statements and is included in mining properties  land  and water rights 
at least of the contributions would be provided upon receipt of all permits  full financing and the company s board of directors decision to proceed with construction 
the remaining payments would be split evenly with one payment due no later than days from the commencement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project and the remaining payment due one year thereafter 
permitting considerations in the ordinary course of business  mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations 
the llc will be required to obtain a rod from the blm authorizing implementation of the mt 
hope project poo 
this approval can be obtained only after successful completion of the process of environmental evaluation  which incorporates substantial public comment 
the llc will also need to obtain various state and federal permits including water protection  air quality  water rights and reclamation permits 
in addition to requiring permits for the development of the mt 
hope project  we will need to obtain and modify various mining and 
table of contents environmental permits during the life of the mt 
hope project 
obtaining  modifying  and renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and substantial expenditures 
the duration and success of the llc s efforts to obtain  modify or renew permits will be contingent upon many variables  some of which are not within the llc s control 
increased costs or delays could occur  depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
all necessary permits may not be obtained and  if obtained  may not be renewed  or the costs involved in each case may exceed those that we previously estimated 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that the llc would not proceed with the development or operation of the mt 
hope project 
water rights considerations in addition to working to complete the eis  we are working to finalize the transfer of water rights to mining use 
in march we were granted our water applications in a ruling by the state engineer 
however  that ruling was successfully appealed in april in nevada district court ndc  remanding the matter for another hearing by the state engineer 
on july   the state engineer issued a second ruling granting the company s water right applications 
in august  eureka county and two other parties comprised of three individual water rights holders in diamond valley and one in kobeh valley  filed petitions and amended and supplemental petitions petitions with the ndc appealing the second ruling of the state engineer 
we continue to anticipate a favorable ndc decision  upholding the state engineer s second ruling 
the appeal hearing is set for april  before the ndc 
a decision by the ndc is expected in mid  although the ndc is not required to act under any specified timeline 
the appeal does not prevent the state engineer from issuing the permits and as such  the state engineer completed issuance of all permits on december  and certain amended permits on january  subject to the second ruling 
the water will become available for consumptive use following the state engineer s approval of the company s monitoring  management and mitigation plan m plan  developed with the input and cooperation of eureka county 
the company is continuing to work with the state engineer and eureka county following our prior submissions  to finalize the m plan and we anticipate the state engineer will approve the m plan prior to commencement of construction  in the second half of environmental considerations our mineral property holdings in shoshone county  idaho include lands contained in mining districts that have been designated as superfund sites pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act 
this superfund site was established to investigate and remediate primarily the bunker hill properties of smelterville  idaho  a small portion of shoshone county where a large smelter was located 
however  because of the extent of environmental impact caused by the historical mining in the mining district  the superfund site covers the majority of shoshone county including our chicago london and little pine creek properties as well as many small towns located in northern idaho 
we have conducted a property environmental investigation of these properties  which revealed no evidence of material adverse environmental effects at either property 
we are unaware of any pending action or proceeding relating to any regulatory matters that would affect our financial position due to these inactive mining claims in shoshone county 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements

provision for taxes income taxes are provided based upon the asset and liability method of accounting 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end

if the sum of estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis is less than the carrying amount of the related asset grouping  asset impairment is considered to exist 
the related impairment loss is measured by comparing estimated future net cash flows on a discounted basis to the carrying amount of the asset 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are a development stage company in the business of the exploration  development and mining of properties primarily containing molybdenum 
as a result  upon commencement of production  our financial performance could be materially affected by fluctuations in the market price of molybdenum and other metals we may mine 
the market prices of metals can fluctuate widely due to a number of factors 
these factors include fluctuations with respect to the rate of inflation  the exchange rates of the us dollar and other currencies  interest rates  global or regional political and economic conditions  banking environment  global and regional demand  production costs  and investor sentiment 
in order to better manage commodity price risk and to seek to reduce the negative impact of fluctuations in prices  we will seek to enter into long term supply contracts for our portion of the mt 
hope production

hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
the supply agreement provides for a floor price along with a discount for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years after the commencement of commercial production at the mt

additionally  on may   we entered into a molybdenum supply agreement with seah besteel corporation seah besteel  korea s largest manufacturer of specialty steels  which provides for seah besteel to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
like the arcelormittal supply agreement  the supply agreement with seah besteel provides for a floor price along with staged discounts for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years from the date of first supply under the agreement

the sojitz agreement provides for the supply of million pounds per year of molybdenum for five years  beginning once the mt 
hope project reaches certain minimum commercial production levels 
one million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be subject to a per pound molybdenum floor price and is offset by a flat discount to spot molybdenum prices above the floor 
the remaining million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be sold with reference to spot molybdenum prices without regard to a floor price 
the sojitz agreement includes a provision that allows sojitz the option to cancel in the event that supply from the mt 
hope project has not begun by january  based on our current development timeline  sojitz will have the option to cancel its contract or participate in the molybdenum supply agreement as described above

on march   the company entered into a molybdenum supply agreement hanlong agreement with hanlong 
the hanlong agreement requires hanlong to purchase the company s entire share of the mt 
hope molybdenum production above that necessary for the company to meet its existing supply commitments until the expiration of those commitments 
after the expiration of the existing supply agreements  until the original scheduled maturity date of the term loan  or if the company elects not to enter into the term loan  years after commencement of commercial production  hanlong must annually purchase the greater of million pounds or of the company s share of mt 
hope production 
following the original scheduled maturity date of the term loan  or if the company elects not to enter into the term loan  years after commencement of commercial production from the mt 
hope mine  hanlong must purchase a percentage of the company s share of mt 
hope production equal to times hanlong s fully diluted percentage ownership of our common stock 
subject to certain exceptions  the hanlong agreement will terminate once hanlong s fully diluted ownership percentage falls below 
as long as hanlong continues to guarantee the term loan  the hanlong agreement will not terminate even if hanlong s ownership falls below 
if the cause of hanlong s ownership falling below is a change of control of the company or a dilutive transaction in which hanlong does not have the right to participate  the hanlong agreement will not terminate and hanlong will be obligated to continue to purchase a percentage of the company s share of mt 
hope production equal to times hanlong s fully diluted percentage ownership of the company as it existed immediately prior to such change of control or dilutive transaction 
if the company elects not to enter into the term loan  and the second loan tranche does not close  hanlong s obligation to purchase the company s share of mt 
hope production in each of the periods described above will be half of the obligations described above 
the supply off take agreement provides for a floor price  along with a discount for spot prices above the floor price  for twenty five percent of the production hanlong receives

all four long term supply agreements provide for supply only after commercial production levels are achieved  and no provisions require the company to deliver product or make any payments if commercial production is never achieved or declines  in later periods and have floor prices ranging from to per pound and incremental discounts above the floor price 
the agreements require that monthly shortfalls be made up only if the company s portion of mt 
hope production is available for delivery  after pos minerals has taken its share 
in no event do these requirements to make up monthly shortfalls become obligations of the company if production does not meet targeted levels 
furthermore  each of the agreements have take or pay provisions that require the buyers to either take delivery of product made available by the company  or to pay as though they had taken delivery pursuant to the term of the agreements
