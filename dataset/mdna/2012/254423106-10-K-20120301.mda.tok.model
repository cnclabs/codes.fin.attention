you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
business overview the company the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in with the name ihop corp 
effective june   the name of the company was changed to dineequity  inc the company  we or our 
the first international house of pancakes ihop restaurant opened in in toluca lake  california 
shortly thereafter  we began developing and franchising additional restaurants 
in november  we completed the acquisition of applebee s international  inc applebee s which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
through various ihop and applebee s subsidiaries see exhibit  subsidiaries of dineequity  inc we own and operate two restaurant concepts in the casual dining and family dining categories of the food service industry applebee s neighborhood grill and bar and ihop 
dineequity  inc is the parent of the ihop and applebee s subsidiaries 
references herein to applebee s and ihop restaurants are to these two restaurant concepts  whether operated by franchisees  area licensees or the company 
domestically  ihop restaurants are located in all states while applebee s restaurants are located in every state except hawaii 
internationally  ihop restaurants are located in two united states territories and three foreign countries  applebee s restaurants are located in one united states territory and foreign countries 
as of december   our system wide restaurant portfolio consisted of december  applebee s ihop total domestic franchise area license company international franchise area license total percentage franchised with over  restaurants combined  we believe we are the largest full service restaurant company in the world 
since the applebee s acquisition  we have pursued a strategy to transition from an applebee s system that was franchised at the time of the acquisition to a franchised applebee s system  similar to ihop s franchised system 
we have made substantial progress in executing that strategy 
as of december   we have refranchised applebee s company operated restaurants since the acquisition 
we refranchised an additional applebee s company operated restaurants in a six state market area geographically centered around memphis  tennessee in january we are planning to franchise a significant majority of the remaining applebee s company operated restaurants over the next several years while retaining part of the kansas city area as a company market 
we believe our highly franchised business model requires less capital investment  generates higher gross profit margins and reduces the volatility of free cash flow performance over time  as compared to a model based on operating a significant number of company restaurants 

table of contents key performance indicators in evaluating and assessing the performance of our business  we consider our key performance indicators to be i percentage change in domestic same restaurant sales for applebee s and ihop  ii applebee s company operated restaurant operating margin  iii net franchise restaurant development for applebee s and ihop  iv consolidated cash from operations  and v consolidated free cash flow 
an overview of our performance in these metrics is as follows applebee s ihop percentage change in domestic same restaurant sales system wide percentage change in domestic same restaurant sales franchise percentage change in domestic same restaurant sales company n a restaurant operating margin n a net franchise restaurant development restaurants refranchised n a not applicable given relatively small number and test market nature of ihop company restaurants for the year ended december  our consolidated cash from operations was million and our consolidated free cash flow was million 
additional information on each of these metrics is presented under the captions restaurant data  company restaurant operations and liquidity and capital resources below 
key overall strategies dineequity s key strategies dineequity is continuing with its efforts to reduce debt and improve profitability 
keys to this are the ongoing refranchising activity and an ongoing program to leverage core competencies across the entire enterprise to reduce costs and improve effectiveness 
we have a fundamentally differentiated approach to brand management that centers on the powerful and strategic combination of marketing  menu  operations and remodel initiatives that creates a unique and relevant connection with our guests 
additionally  our shared services operating platform allows our brands to focus on key factors that drive the business while leveraging the resources and expertise of our scalable  centralized support structure 
we believe this is a competitive point of difference 
together  this closely integrated approach results in differentiated brand performance that drives dineequity s growth and delivers results for our shareholders 
applebee s key strategies we are in the process of a multi year effort to revitalize the applebee s brand 
applebee s domestic system wide same restaurant sales increased in this was applebee s second year of positive results and outpaced our group of competitors 
we accomplished this growth by executing on the following key strategies i drive profitable sales and traffic  ii improve margins and restaurant level economics  and iii transform the business 
drive profitable sales and traffic continued focus on meeting the consumer s need for value throughout  with such promotions as the return of our successful sizzling entr es starting at nationwide and the rotation of new products into our for offering 
we ended the year with sizzling entr es featuring our double barrel whiskey sirloin  a popular addition to our sizzling entr es lineup  continued innovation of the menu 
since the acquisition in  more than of applebee s menu now consists of either new offerings or improved offerings with high quality ingredients  continued our unique healthy food offerings by refreshing our under calorie menu in january  which combined with our weight watchers menu has established us as a category leader in providing healthy dining options to our guests  focused on late night business through beverage and appetizer innovation and local restaurant marketing efforts  and launched a guest driven lunch program focusing on choice and pace of service in early 
table of contents improve margins and restaurant level economics we have continued to build upon process and system improvements deployed in prior years by improving our operating metrics 
food inventory management and labor efficiencies were realized during the second half of  which will carry forward into these operational improvements helped mitigate the impact of increasing commodity costs and higher payroll taxes 
we continued to reap the benefits of our supply chain co op to leverage our scale to manage through commodity cost inflation  which was also mitigated by the realignment of our distribution centers in the margin improvements were not at the expense of the guest as we achieved system wide all time high guest satisfaction scores 
we continue to monitor our franchisees through our franchisee operations rating system  which provides visibility concerning their performance in relation to guest experience  food safety and training 
transform the business in june  we rolled out connections  the new comprehensive restaurant revitalization program involving people  place and promotional aspects 
the people aspect involves re training and re certification for kitchen staff and team members 
the place aspect involves exterior and interior modifications to the restaurant to signal change 
the promotional aspect involves a local public relations and marketing plan to re connect with the neighborhood 
our franchisees have embraced this initiative and by year end  over of the restaurants in the domestic system were revitalized 
the company remains committed to our strategy to transition to a franchise operated applebee s system which includes buyers who are financially qualified  share our vision for revitalizing the applebee s brand  are willing to invest in the business  and have well qualified management teams 
during  we refranchised company operated restaurants and refranchised an additional company operated restaurants in january we anticipate that reaching our goal of a franchisee operated system may take several years to complete 
this highly franchised business model is expected to require less capital investment  improve overall segment profit margins and reduce the volatility of cash flow performance over time  while also providing cash proceeds from the refranchising of the restaurants for the retirement of debt 
in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive casual dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results  including the refranchising of the remaining applebee s domestic company operated restaurants  within the time frame anticipated 
ihop s key strategies we pursue growth through a three part strategic framework energize and grow the ihop brand  improve operations performance  and optimize franchise development 
energize and grow the ihop brand we continually seek to energize and grow our brand while protecting and leveraging our breakfast heritage 
in  we launched make it an ihop day  which will build on the success of our previous award winning advertising campaign of come hungry 
leave happy 
our new campaign provides a unique opportunity to further engage guests and foster the emotional connection they have with our brand 
in  we continued the strategy of limited time offers on promotional products 
we seek to enhance our media strategies to emphasize national advertising on broadcast  cable and syndicated television and strengthen our product promotion process 
over the last four years  we have shifted the allocation of our media spending towards national advertising 
due to this reallocation from local to national advertising  starting in we were able to provide continuous media support for all national initiatives and limited time offers  as well as secondary messages such as national pancake day  ihop for dinner  gift cards and kids eat free 
our current remodel program  commenced in  captures the energy and innovation necessary to keep the ihop brand relevant  dynamic and enticing 
we continue to expand our gift card program to increase the number of points of distribution 
in  we implemented a business to business gift card program 
we are also actively enhancing our social media presence 
we continue to build the e club  launched in  which enables both national and local offers to be sent electronically to our guests that sign up for the program 

table of contents improve operations performance we strive to improve every aspect of restaurant operations 
to enhance our guest centric culture  in ihop moved our guest feedback process from a mystery shop to a voice of the guest program  which provides real time consumer responses to the operators and the brand 
ihop continues its use of a franchisee grading system adopted during  which evaluates the operational standards of each of our restaurants 
this franchisee grading system is a comprehensive scorecard that includes voice of the guest scores  operational assessment scores and health department ratings  among other things 
in addition  we intend to continue our focus on making exceptional service a priority for franchisees by providing tools for improved restaurant execution  while highlighting our motto  service as good as our pancakes 
our goal is to create a memorable guest experience while consistently delivering delicious  appealing food 
substantially all ihop restaurants are using pollable point of sale systems to capture and report a broad range of sales and product mix data 
this information is used by management to  among other things  gauge guest acceptance of menu items and the success of promotions and limited time offers 
optimize franchise development under the current business model  ihop seeks to optimize franchise development by recruiting franchise developers within and outside the current system and working with these franchise developers in the site selection and building process 
this strategy has proved successful as we have developed approximately restaurants since the inception of the current business model and we have a pipeline of additional new restaurants committed  optioned or pending 
the strong existing franchisee base accounts for over of these future development obligations 
in addition  we may take steps to consolidate and rehabilitate existing markets if we believe that doing so is advisable in order to fully realize development potential 
in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive family dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results within the time frame anticipated 
highlights highlights of our fiscal performance include reducing our long term debt by million  in turn lowering our consolidated leverage ratio to x at december  from x at december  the reduction primarily came from a combination of cash proceeds and elimination of financing obligations from the refranchising of applebee s company operated restaurants and our free cash flow 
increasing applebee s domestic same restaurant sales by during  the second consecutive year of same restaurant sales growth 
applebee s same restaurant sales have increased in five of the last six quarters 
refranchising of applebee s company operated restaurants  bringing the total number of applebee s refranchised to since the acquisition and increasing the percentage of franchise restaurants in applebee s system to 
repricing of our senior secured credit facility  which lowered the interest rate floor on the variable rate facility from to and increased the amount of our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate reduction lowered our interest expense on borrowings under the senior secured credit facility by approximately million 
opening of new restaurants worldwide by ihop franchisees and area licensees 
remodeling over restaurants system wide 
applebee s and its franchisees remodeled restaurants during while ihop and its franchisees remodeled restaurants 
expanding the international scope of ihop s system by entering into a multi restaurant franchise agreement for the development of new ihop restaurants in kuwait  the kingdom of saudi arabia  jordan  lebanon  qatar  the united arab emirates  oman  bahrain and egypt 

table of contents significant known events  trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results current economic conditions while gross domestic product grew at a modest pace during  we believe overhanging concerns about high levels of unemployment and fluctuating levels of home foreclosures in addition to lower overall valuations for residential real estate and rising gasoline prices may continue to temper consumer discretionary spending 
a decline or lack of growth in disposable income for discretionary spending could cause our customers to change historic purchasing behavior and choose lower cost dining options or alternatives to dining out 
these factors could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales trends domestic system wide same restaurant sales increase decrease q q q q q q q q q q q q applebee s quarter ytd ihop quarter ytd applebee s domestic system wide same restaurant sales increased for the year ended december  this marked the second consecutive year of same restaurant sales growth 
the increase in same restaurant sales was driven mainly by an increase in average guest check as guest traffic was flat 
the higher average guest check came from an increase of approximately in menu pricing and an increase from favorable product mix changes 
ihop s domestic system wide same restaurant sales decreased for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decline in guest traffic  which we believe was due in part to certain promotions during the year that did not drive sales as expected  partially offset by a higher average guest check compared to fiscal debt modification and retirements on february   we entered into amendment no 
the amendment to our existing credit agreement dated as of october  the credit agreement 
pursuant to the amendment  the interest rate margin applicable to libor based loans was reduced from to  and the interest rate floors used to determine the libor and base rate reference rates for loans were reduced from to for libor based loans and from to for base rate denominated loans 
we recognized costs of million in our consolidated statements of operations related to this debt modification 
during the year ended december   we repaid million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and we repurchased million of our senior notes 
including write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired and a million premium paid on the senior notes  we recognized a loss on the retirement of debt of million 
additionally  as the result of refranchising applebee s company operated restaurants  we were released from financing obligations of million related to of the properties refranchised 
financial statement effect of refranchising company operated restaurants we plan to transition to a franchisee operated applebee s system by refranchising and selling the related restaurant assets of a significant majority of the remaining applebee s company operated restaurants when such refranchisings and sales are in alignment with our business strategy 
we may suspend or delay our plans to refranchise applebee s company operated restaurants and sell the related restaurant assets if we do not believe the sales proceeds from the transaction would be satisfactory 
we consider a range of factors that could impact the likelihood of future refranchising of applebee s company operated restaurants and sale of related restaurant assets and possible proceeds from such transactions 
as the number of company operated restaurants declines  the amount reported in future periods for company restaurant revenues and company restaurant expenses will also decline while franchise royalty revenues and expenses will increase  as 
table of contents compared to amounts reported in previous periods 
segment profit will also decline as company operated restaurants are refranchised because the associated royalties are a smaller percentage of restaurant revenues than the restaurant operating profit margin percentage of restaurants formerly company operated 
however  refranchising of additional applebee s company operated restaurants will result in the reduction of interest expense as proceeds from the sale of related restaurant assets subject to certain exclusions must be used to retire debt 
refranchising of additional applebee s company operated restaurants also will result in a reduction of both general and administrative expenses and required capital investment in restaurant assets 
stock repurchase program on august   the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
under the program  we may repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis from time to time in open market transactions and in privately negotiated transactions  as appropriate 
the repurchase program does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares and may be terminated at any time 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares of stock for million  at an average price of per share 
significant gains and charges there were several significant gains and charges that affect the comparisons of fiscal year results with the previous periods presented herein  as shown in the following table year ended december  in millions impairment and closure charges loss gain on extinguishment of debt and temporary equity gain on disposition of assets each transaction is discussed in further detail under paragraphs captioned with those descriptions elsewhere in item the significant impairment and closure charges in primarily related to a million impairment of intangible assets 
our fixed and intangible assets including goodwill must be assessed continually for indicators of impairment 
given the uncertainty as to future economic and other assumptions used in assessing impairments  it is possible that significant impairment charges may occur in future periods 
we incurred significant charges in connection with the refinancing of debt in october additionally  prior to that refinancing  our debt traded at less than its carrying value such that early retirement by purchases on the open market resulted in significant gains 
the fair value of our current debt instruments is currently greater than its carrying value see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  while we may dedicate a portion of excess cash flow towards early debt retirement  we do not anticipate recognizing gains on the extinguishment of debt 
gains on disposition of assets relate primarily to the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of applebee s company operated restaurants 
while we plan to refranchise a significant majority of the remaining applebee s company operated restaurants  there can be no assurance as to either the timing of additional transactions or the amount of gain or loss that may be recognized in the future 
restaurant data the following table sets forth  for each of the past three years  the number of effective restaurants in the applebee s and ihop systems and information regarding the percentage change in sales at those restaurants compared to the same period in the prior year 
effective restaurants are the number of restaurants in a given period  adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period 
information is presented for all effective restaurants in the applebee s and ihop systems  which includes company operated restaurants  as well as those operated by franchisees and area licensees 
sales of restaurants that are operated by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the company 
however  we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales  as well as  in some cases  rental payments under leases that are usually based on a percentage of their sales 
management also uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants as well as evaluation of current operations

provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in as compared to a recognized tax benefit of million in the change was primarily due to the increase in our pretax book income 
the effective tax rate of applied to pretax book income was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to tax credits and changes in tax rates and the release of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
the tax credits are primarily fica tip and other compensation related credits associated with applebee s company owned restaurant operations

the company believes that the decline experienced in comparable guest traffic is reflective of the current adverse economic conditions affecting customers and impacting the restaurant industry as a whole 
the decrease in applebee s franchise expenses was primarily due to costs associated with revenues from temporary liquor license agreements in that did not recur 
the revenues and expenses related to the temporary liquor license agreements did not result in any significant segment profit in the increase in ihop franchise expenses was due to the costs of sales associated with the increased revenues from franchise advertising fees and higher bad debt expense  partially offset by lower costs of pancake and waffle dry mix sales 
applebee s franchise expenses are relatively smaller than ihop s due to advertising expenses 
franchise fees designated for ihop s national advertising fund and local marketing and advertising cooperatives are recognized as revenue and expense of franchise operations  however  applebee s national advertising fund constitutes an agency transaction and therefore is not recognized as franchise revenue and expense 
the increase in bad debt expense related primarily to a franchise operator of ihop franchise restaurants that defaulted on its obligations in the fourth quarter of we have fully reserved all amounts due from this franchisee as of december  which adversely impacted segment profit by approximately million

a decrease in domestic same restaurant sales of and the closure of seven restaurants in were responsible for the rest of the decline 
the change in same restaurant sales was driven mainly by a decline in guest traffic that was partially offset by a slightly higher average guest check 
the higher average guest check is primarily the result of an increase of approximately in menu pricing and favorable product mix changes

stock based compensation costs increased primarily due to the acceleration of expenses due to changes resulting from vesting of certain equity grants to directors and the retirement of an executive and the impact of a higher stock price on equity grants accounted for as liabilities 
the increase in salaries and benefits is primarily due to an increase in managers and related training costs and the filling of open positions at applebee s 
the increase in recruiting costs was primarily due to the hiring of more executive level positions in partially offsetting these increases were the absence of one time costs of million incurred in february related to the establishment of a purchasing co operative and lower professional services expenses

impairment and closure charges impairment and closure charges for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  in millions tradename impairment long lived tangible asset impairment closure charges total impairment and closure charges 
table of contents tradename impairment in accordance with us gaap  indefinite lived intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of our common stock 
in performing the impairment review of the tradename intangible asset  we primarily use the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales  a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream 
during the course of fiscal and  we made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions noted above 
as a result of these assessments  we determined an interim test of indefinite lived intangibles was not necessary in either or during the fourth quarter of  we performed the annual test of impairment for indefinite lived intangibles  primarily the applebee s tradename assigned in the purchase price allocation 
we determined the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the carrying values and in the absence of other indicators of impairment we concluded no impairment was necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed the annual test of impairment for indefinite lived intangibles 
as the result of the test  the estimated fair value of the tradename was less than the carrying value and an impairment of million was recognized  along with a related tax benefit of million 
long lived tangible asset impairment and closure costs on a quarterly basis  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of tangible long lived assets  primarily assets related to company operated restaurants  may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a restaurant s assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful lives or remaining lease terms  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  this may be an indicator of impairment 
if it is decided that there has been an impairment  the carrying amount of the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
the fair value is primarily determined by discounting the future cash flows based on our cost of capital 
as the result of performing these assessments throughout  we recognized impairments of long lived tangible assets of million 
in october  we sold company operated applebee s restaurants located in minnesota and wisconsin 
we had fee ownership of the properties on which three of the restaurants were located 
our strategy does not contemplate retaining such properties as a lessor on a long term basis 
the properties were transferred to assets held for sale and an impairment of million was recorded based on the estimated sales price 
we also placed a single restaurant and the land on which it is situated up for sale 
in accordance with criteria under us gaap we transferred the fair value of the assets related to this restaurant  as determined by the estimated sales price  to assets held for sale and an impairment of million was recognized 
other minor impairments totaled million 
closure charges in of million related primarily to two company operated ihop cafe restaurants a non traditional restaurant test format that was evaluated but will no longer be utilized and to the closure of a company operated applebee s restaurant in china 
as the result of performing these assessments throughout  we recognized impairments of long lived tangible assets of million in the impaired assets comprised three ihop company operated restaurants  various assets related to one ihop franchise restaurant  one applebee s company operated restaurant  a write down to the estimated sales value based on a current letter of intent of one applebee s restaurant that had been closed in a prior period and included in assets held for sale as of december  and four parcels of applebee s real estate 
we had fee ownership of the properties on which four applebee s company operated restaurants were located 
these restaurants were refranchised in the fourth quarter of but we retained ownership of the land and continued to lease the property to the franchisee 
our strategy does not contemplate retaining such properties as a lessor on a long term basis 
during the third quarter of  we determined the properties met the requirements under us gaap to be reclassified as assets held for sale 
the properties were written down to the estimated fair value that will be received upon sale 
we evaluated the causal factors of all impairments of long lived assets as they were recorded during and and concluded they were based on factors specific to each asset and were not potential indicators of an impairment of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or other long lived assets 
closure costs of million related to two ihop franchise restaurants 
loss gain on extinguishment of debt and temporary equity in  we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt and temporary equity of million compared with a gain on extinguishment of debt of million in the loss in was comprised of charges of million resulting from the october refinancing and the redemption of series a stock and a million loss on extinguishment of debt subsequent to 
table of contents the october refinancing  partially offset by gains on extinguishment of debt of million 
the charges consisted of approximately million of deferred financing costs associated with our previous securitized debt structure  including the remaining balance in accumulated other comprehensive income of a loss related to an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge  and approximately million of prepayment costs and tender premiums associated with the retirement of the securitized debt 
tender premiums associated with the series a stock were included as dividends paid and not part of the loss on extinguishment

we may continue to dedicate a portion of excess cash flow towards opportunistic debt retirement 
however  our debt no longer trades at a discount to face value  therefore future retirements will most likely result in a loss on retirement due to the write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired 
gain on disposition of assets we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of million in  primarily related to the refranchising of applebee s restaurants in the minnesota market and restaurants in the roanoke and lynchburg markets in virginia 
we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of million in  primarily related to the refranchising of seven applebee s restaurants in the new mexico market and sale of a parcel of land held by ihop 
other expense income in  other items of income and expense netted to an expense of million compared to an expense of million in the primary reason for the change was several individually insignificant gains in did not recur in provision benefit for income taxes we recognized a tax benefit of million in as compared to a tax provision of million in the change was primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income resulting from the one time expenses related to the debt refinancing 
the effective tax rate benefit of applied to pretax book income was significantly different from the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income resulting from the one time expenses related to the debt refinancing  changes in unrecognized tax benefits and tax credits

table of contents liquidity and capital resources of the company credit facilities on october   we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders and financial institutions the credit agreement that established a senior secured credit facility the credit facility consisting of a million term facility the term facility maturing in october and a million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving facility maturing in october loans made under the term facility and the revolving facility bore interest  at our option  at an annual rate equal to i a libor based rate which was subject to a floor of plus a margin of or ii the base rate the base rate which was subject to a floor of  which was equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the prime rate and c the one month libor rate which was subject to a floor of plus  plus a margin of 
the margin for the revolving facility is subject to debt leverage based step downs 
the revolving facility is utilized  among other purposes  to collateralize certain letters of credit we are required to maintain 
such collateralization does not constitute a draw down under the revolving facility but does reduce the amount that can be borrowed under the revolving facility 
unused amounts of the revolving facility bear interest at the rate of basis points per annum 
the credit agreement also provides for an uncommitted incremental facility that permits the company  subject to certain conditions  to increase the credit facility by up to million  provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments under the revolving facility may not exceed million 
october refinancing on october   we borrowed million under the term facility the original term loan and we issued million of senior notes the senior notes at par that will mature in october with a coupon of per annum 
interest on the senior notes is payable in the months of april and october of each year  beginning in april these borrowings  along with cash on hand not required for operating needs and previously restricted cash becoming available concurrently with the retirement of securitized debt totaled approximately billion 
with these funds we completed a refinancing of our then outstanding billion of securitized debt 
we also redeemed  shares of our series a stock for million  including a redemption premium and accrued dividends through the date of redemption 
we also paid million of prepayment costs and tender premiums associated with the retirement of the securitized debt and million of transaction costs related to the refinancing 
in november  we redeemed the remaining  shares of series a stock for million including a redemption premium and accrued dividends through the date of redemption 
the material agreements entered into related to the october refinancing were included as exhibit and exhibits and of our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september  filed on november  february amendment on february   we entered into amendment no 
the amendment to the credit agreement 
pursuant to the amendment  the interest rate margin applicable to libor based loans under the term facility was reduced from to  and the interest rate floors used to determine the libor and base rate reference rates for loans under the term facility were reduced from to for libor based loans and from to for base rate denominated loans 
the margin for the revolving facility is subject to debt leverage based step downs 
as of december   we have not achieved a leverage ratio that would result in any such step downs 
in addition  the amendment increased the available lender commitments under the revolving facility from million to million 
the amendment also modified certain restrictive covenants of the credit agreement  including those relating to repurchases of other debt securities  permitted acquisitions and payments on equity 
the amendment was included as exhibit of our current report on form k filed on february  concurrent with the amendment  on february   the company borrowed million under the term facility the new term loan  retiring the same amount then outstanding of the million original term loan 
as of december   the interest rate on the term facility was 
taking into account fees and expenses associated with the credit agreement and the amendment that will be amortized as additional non cash interest expense over a seven year period  the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december  was 
during we borrowed and repaid a total of million under the revolving facility 
as of december   no amounts were borrowed under the revolving facility and approximately million in letters of credit were collateralized by the revolving facility  reducing the amount available to be borrowed under the revolving facility to million 

table of contents we may in the future enter into hedging agreements to mitigate the effect of changes in libor on variable interest rates 
mandatory repayments loans under the credit agreement are subject to the following repayment requirements per year of principal balance the mandatory repayment is based upon the million new term loan  of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  paid  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and of asset sales and insurance proceeds subject to certain exclusions 
we may voluntarily prepay loans under both the term facility and the revolving facility without premium or penalty 
however  if we make a voluntary prepayment within one year after the closing date of the credit agreement in the case of the revolving facility  or one year after the february refinancing in the case of the term facility  in connection with any transaction that results in a lower effective interest rate  we must pay a prepayment premium in an amount equal to of the principal amount prepaid  as applicable 
there were no prepayment premiums required during there are no mandatory repayments of the senior notes  although under certain conditions we may be required to repurchase senior notes with excess proceeds of assets sales or upon a change of control  as described in the indenture under which the senior notes were issued 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during debt covenants pursuant to the credit agreement we are required to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated cash interest coverage ratio 
the company s current required maximum consolidated leverage ratio of total debt net of unrestricted cash not to exceed million to adjusted ebitda is x 
our current required minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to consolidated cash interest is x 
compliance with each of these ratios is required quarterly  on a trailing four quarter basis 
these ratio thresholds become more rigorous over time 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratio will decline  in annual basis point decrements beginning with the first quarter of  to x by the first quarter of  then to x for the first quarter of until the credit agreement expires in october the minimum consolidated cash interest coverage ratio will increase to x commencing in the first quarter of and to x commencing in the first quarter of and remain at that level until the credit agreement expires in october for the trailing twelve months ended december   our consolidated leverage ratio was x and our consolidated cash interest coverage ratio was x 
there are no financial maintenance covenants associated with the senior notes 
the senior notes  the term facility and the revolving facility are also subject to affirmative and negative covenants considered customary for similar types of facilities  including  but not limited to  covenants with respect to incremental indebtedness  liens  restricted payments including dividends  investments  affiliate transactions  and capital expenditures 
these covenants are subject to a number of important limitations  qualifications and exceptions 
importantly  certain of these covenants will not be applicable to the notes during any time that the notes maintain investment grade ratings 
the ebitda used in calculating these ratios is considered to be a non us gaap measure 
the reconciliation between our income before income taxes  as determined in accordance with us gaap  and ebitda used for covenant compliance purposes is as follows

franchising of applebee s company operated restaurants during  we completed the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of applebee s company operated restaurants 
proceeds from asset dispositions  including the restaurants  totaled million for the twelve months ended  the majority of which was used to retire debt 
since the applebee s acquisition we have pursued a strategy to transition from the franchised applebee s system at the time of the acquisition to a franchised applebee s system  similar to ihop s franchised system 
as of december   we have refranchised applebee s company operated restaurants since the second quarter of subsequent to december  we refranchised applebee s company operated restaurants in a six state market area geographically centered around memphis  tennessee in january  including the restaurants refranchised in january  the applebee s system is approximately franchised 
we are planning to franchise a significant majority of the remaining applebee s company operated restaurants over the next several years while retaining restaurants in the kansas city area as a company market 
this highly franchised business model is expected to require less capital investment  improve margins and reduce the volatility of cash flow performance over time  while also providing cash proceeds from the refranchising of the restaurants for the retirement of debt 
under the terms of the credit agreement  all of the proceeds of future asset dispositions must be used to repay borrowings under the term facility and under certain conditions  we may be required to repurchase senior notes with excess proceeds of assets sales  as defined in the indenture under which the senior notes were issued 
cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by revenues earned and collected from our franchisees  operating earnings from our company operated restaurants and profit from our rental operations and financing operations 
franchise revenues consist of royalties  ihop advertising fees and sales of proprietary products for ihop  each of which fluctuates with increases or decreases in franchise retail sales 
franchise retail sales are impacted by the development of ihop and applebee s restaurants by our franchisees and by fluctuations in same restaurant sales 
operating earnings from company operated restaurants are impacted by many factors which include but are not limited to changes in traffic patterns  pricing activities and changes in operating expenses 
rental operations profit is rental income less rental expenses 
rental income includes revenues from operating leases and interest 
table of contents income from direct financing leases 
rental income is impacted by fluctuations in same restaurant sales as some operating leases include a provision for contingent rent based on retail sales 
rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on franchisee operated restaurants 
financing operations revenue consists of interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases as well as periodic sales of equipment 
financing expenses are primarily the cost of restaurant equipment 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million during the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in  a decrease of million 
the primary reasons for this unfavorable change were lower segment profit  excluding depreciation changes  of million  a cash payment of million related to the termination of the sublease of applebee s restaurant support center and an increase of million in cash interest payments 
the lower segment profit was due  in large part  to the refranchising of applebee s company operated restaurants since october investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily attributable to million of proceeds from dispositions of assets  primarily the refranchising of applebee s company operated restaurants  and million of principal receipts from notes  equipment contracts and other long term receivables  partially offset by million of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures increased from million in due primarily to the remodeling of company operated restaurants and increases in information technology infrastructure expenditures

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangibles goodwill is recorded when the aggregate purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and are estimated by management based on the fair value of the assets received 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised primarily of trademarks  tradenames  liquor licenses  which are considered to have an indefinite life  and franchise agreements  recipes and menus and favorable lease agreements  which are considered to have a finite life 
intangible assets with finite lives are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization 
goodwill has been allocated to three reporting units  the ihop unit  applebee s company unit and applebee s franchise unit 
the significant majority of the company s goodwill resulted from the november  acquisition of applebee s and has been allocated between the two applebee s units 
the goodwill allocated to the applebee s company unit was fully impaired in the company tests goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter 
the annual impairment test of goodwill of the applebee s franchise unit is performed as of october of each year 
the annual impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop unit is performed as of december of each year  the date as of which the analysis has been performed in prior years 
in addition to the annual test of impairment  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets must be evaluated more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
in the process of the company s annual impairment review of goodwill  the company primarily uses the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the discounted cash flows model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures  and changes in working capital along with an appropriate discount rate 
additional assumptions are made as to proceeds to be received from future refranchising of company operated restaurants 
step one of the impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value 
if the fair value is in excess of the carrying value  no impairment exists 
if the step one test does indicate an impairment  step two must take place 
under step two  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the carrying amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill  to which the carrying value of the goodwill must be adjusted 
the fair value of all reporting units is then compared to the current market value of the company s common stock to determine if the fair values estimated in the impairment testing process are reasonable in light of the current market value 
in the process of the company s annual impairment review of the tradename  the most significant indefinite life intangible asset  the company primarily uses the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales  a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecasted revenue stream 
long lived assets we assess long lived and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant 
table of contents facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
we consider factors such as the number of years the restaurant has been operated by us  sales trends  cash flow trends  remaining lease life  and other factors which apply on a case by case basis 
the analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment 
recoverability of the restaurant s assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful life or remaining lease term  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  the carrying amount is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss resulting from impairment is recognized by charging to earnings 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are recorded in four categories franchise operations  company restaurant operations  rental operations and financing operations 
the franchise operations revenue consists primarily of royalty revenues  sales of proprietary ihop products  ihop advertising fees and the portion of the franchise fees allocated to the company s intellectual property 
company restaurant sales are retail sales at company operated restaurants 
rental operations revenue includes revenue from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases 
financing operations revenue consists of the portion of franchise fees not allocated to the company s intellectual property and sales of equipment as well as interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases 
revenues from franchised and area licensed restaurants include royalties  continuing rent and service fees and initial franchise fees 
royalties are recognized in the period in which the sales are reported to have occurred 
continuing fees are recognized in the period earned 
initial franchise fees are recognized upon the opening of a restaurant  which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
fees from development agreements are deferred and recorded into income when a restaurant under the development agreement is opened 
sales by company operated restaurants are recognized when food and beverage items are sold 
company restaurant sales are reported net of sales taxes collected from guests and the sales taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities 
in addition  the company records a liability in the period in which a gift card is issued and proceeds are received 
as gift cards are redeemed  this liability is reduced and revenue is recognized 
the company recognizes gift card breakage income on gift cards issued by applebee s when the likelihood of redemption of the gift card becomes remote 
this assessment is based upon applebee s historical experience with gift card redemptions 
the company does not recognize breakage income on gift cards issued by ihop because the ihop gift card program has not been in existence as long as the applebee s program and does not have adequate history on which to base recognition of breakage income 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing receivables  however  changes in circumstances relating to receivables may result in additional allowances in the future 
we determine the allowance based on historical experience  current payment patterns  future obligations and our assessment of the ability to pay outstanding balances 
the primary indicator of credit quality is delinquency  which is considered to be a receivable balance greater than days past due 
we continually review our allowance for doubtful accounts 
past due balances and future obligations are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
leases our restaurants are located on i sites owned by us  ii sites leased by us from third parties and iii sites owned or leased by franchisees 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease in accordance with the provisions of us gaap governing the accounting for leases 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
prior to january   we capitalized rent expense from possession date through construction completion and reported the related asset in property and equipment 
capitalized rent was amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease term 
straight line rent recorded during the preopening period construction completion through restaurant open date was recorded as expense 
commencing january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeds the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
we use a consistent lease term when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements  when determining straight line rent expense and when determining classification of our leases as either operating or capital 

table of contents there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
certain of our lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances 
for purposes of recognizing incentives  we amortize the incentives over the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term 
for tenant improvement allowances  we also record a deferred rent liability or an obligation in our non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with us gaap governing share based payments 
accordingly  we measure stock based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period using the straight line method 
the fair value of each employee stock option and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based compensation 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of us gaap 
the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
these inputs are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if differences arise between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future stock based compensation expense 
any such changes could materially impact our operations in the period in which the changes are made and in subsequent periods 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayers and respective governmental authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
changes in the tax contingency reserves result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of the statute of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could materially affect our reported results 
under us gaap addressing the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  tax positions that previously failed to meet 
table of contents the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various tax jurisdictions 
the application is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
insurance reserves we use estimates in the determination of the appropriate liabilities for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
the estimated liability is established based upon historical claims data and third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
unanticipated changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates 
we periodically reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
a change in any of the above estimates could impact our consolidated statements of earnings  and the related asset or liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheets would be adjusted accordingly 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
recently adopted accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued auditing standard update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurement asu 
the provision in asu requiring that disclosures about purchase  sale  issuance  and settlement activity related to assets and liabilities whose fair value is measured using level inputs be presented on a gross basis rather than as a net number became effective for us in as this provision amended only the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements  the adoption had no impact on the our balance sheets  statements of operations or statements of cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
this asu amends disclosure requirements with respect to the credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses 
the disclosure requirements about activity that occurs during a reporting period became effective for us in since this asu only amended disclosure requirements  not current accounting practice  adoption of this asu did not have any impact on our balance sheets  statements of operations or statements of cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment asu 
the amendments in asu no 
are intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by adding a qualitative review step to assess whether the required quantitative impairment analysis that exists today is necessary 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
asu no 
will be effective for our fiscal years beginning after december   earlier adoption is permitted 
as the amendments do not change the underlying principle that the carrying value of goodwill should not exceed its implied fair value  the adoption of asu is not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets  statements of income or statements of cash flows 
we reviewed all other significant newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they either are not applicable to the our operations or that no material effect is expected on our financial statements as a result of future adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk  including interest rates and commodity prices 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that may include the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in the united states treasury based interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash 
table of contents and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments  and interest expense on our senior secured credit facility 
our future investment income and interest expense may differ from expectations due to changes in interest rates 
investments in fixed interest rate earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
we currently do not hold any fixed rate investments 
as of december   our long term investments are comprised primarily of certificates of deposits  mutual funds invested in auction rate securities and one auction rate security  these investments are included in restricted assets related to the captive insurance subsidiary 
we have classified these investments as available for sale 
due to the short time period between reset dates of the interest rates  there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with the interest rate related to the auction rate securities 
the one auction rate security has a contractual maturity of december based on our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term restricted investment holdings as of  a increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest income by approximately million 
a decline in interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by less than million as the majority of our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term investment holdings are currently yielding less than 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt the new term loan under the amendment to our credit agreement 
if the interest rate on the new term loan were to increase by per annum  annual interest expense would increase by approximately million based on the outstanding new term loan balance at december  a decrease in interest rates from december  rates would have no impact on interest expense as the current interest is at the floor rate as defined in the credit agreement 
commodity prices many of the food products purchased by us and our franchisees and area licensees are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to unpredictable price volatility 
extreme changes in commodity prices and or long term changes could affect our franchisees  area licensees and company operated restaurants adversely 
we expect that  in most cases  the ihop and applebee s systems would be able to pass increased commodity prices through to our consumers via increases in menu prices 
from time to time  competitive circumstances could limit short term menu price flexibility  and in those cases  margins would be negatively impacted by increased commodity prices 
we believe that any changes in commodity pricing that cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other strategies would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the company and owners of applebee s and ihop franchise restaurants formed cscs to manage procurement activities for the applebee s and ihop restaurants choosing to join the co op 
we believe the larger scale created by combining the supply chain requirements of both brands under one organization can provide cost savings and efficiency in the purchasing function 
as of december   of applebee s franchise restaurants and over of ihop franchise restaurants are members of cscs 
while the majority of the food products utilized by ihop and applebee s systems are sourced through cscs  in some instances  we enter into commitments to purchase food and other items on behalf of the ihop and applebee s systems 
none of these food product contracts or agreements is a derivative instrument 
at december   our outstanding purchase commitments for food products were million
