item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the world s leading vertically integrated producers  marketers and distributors of high quality fresh and fresh cut fruit and vegetables  as well as a leading producer and marketer of prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages and snacks in europe  africa and the middle east 
we market our products worldwide under the del monte brand  a symbol of product innovation  quality  freshness and reliability since our global sourcing and logistics system allows us to provide regular delivery of consistently high quality produce and value added services to our customers 
our major producing operations are located in north  central and south america  asia and africa 
production operations are aggregated on the basis of our products bananas  other fresh produce and prepared foods 
other fresh produce includes pineapples  melons  tomatoes  non tropical fruit including grapes  apples  pears  peaches  plums  nectarines  avocados  citrus and kiwis  fresh cut produce and other fruit and vegetables and a plastic product and box manufacturing business  a grain business which we exited in and third party ocean freight services which we significantly curtailed in 
prepared foods include prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages  snacks  poultry and meat products 
as a result of our decision to exit grain operations in argentina during and the elimination of third party ocean freight services from northern europe to the caribbean during  we have combined the other products and services segment with the other fresh produce segment in due to the relative size of the remaining operations 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
strategy our strategy is focused on a combination of maximizing revenues from our existing infrastructure  entering new markets and strict cost control initiatives 
we plan to continue to capitalize on the growing global demand for fresh produce and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
we expect sales growth of fresh produce in key markets by increasing sales volume and per unit sales prices as permitted by market conditions 
our strategy includes increasing volumes from existing production and distribution facilities in order to improve operating efficiencies and reduce per unit costs 
we plan additional investments in production facilities in order to expand our product offering in established markets and continue with our recent expansion in growth markets  such as the middle east  africa and countries formerly part of the soviet union 
net sales our net sales are affected by numerous factors  including mainly the balance between the supply of and demand for our produce and competition from other fresh produce companies 
our net sales are also dependent on our ability to supply a consistent volume and quality of fresh produce to the markets we serve 
for example  seasonal variations in demand for bananas as a result of increased supply and competition from other fruit are reflected in the seasonal fluctuations in banana prices  with the first six months of each year generally exhibiting stronger demand and higher prices  except in those years where an excess supply exists 
during the first part of banana supplies were not as plentiful as in the prior year 
in  our overall banana sales volume decreased by while our average per unit sales prices increased by 
our net sales of other fresh produce were positively impacted by increased sales volumes of fresh cut fruit  non tropical fruit and pineapples 
in the processed foods business  we generally realize the largest portion of our net sales and gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
during  our prepared food net sales decreased slightly principally as a result of lower sales of canned deciduous products that resulted from reduced sourcing from south africa 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our net sales are significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we conduct our sales versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus such currencies resulting in increased net sales in dollar terms 
including the effect of our foreign currency hedges  net sales for were positively impacted by million  as compared to  principally as a result of a stronger korean won  british pound and japanese yen  partially offset by a weaker euro and kenya shilling  versus the us dollar 
our net sales growth in recent years has been achieved primarily through increased sales volume in existing markets of other fresh produce  primarily pineapples and non tropical fruit  and favorable pricing on our del monte gold extra sweet pineapple combined with increased sales volume and per unit sales prices of bananas in existing and new markets 
during  our net sales were positively affected by higher sales volume of bananas and gold pineapples that resulted from our production expansion  which were offset principally by lower net sales of melons and other products and services 
our net sales growth in recent years is also attributable to a broadening of our product line with the expansion of our fresh cut produce business  specifically increased sales to the foodservice sector  combined with our expansion into new markets 
we expect our net sales growth to continue to be driven by increased sales volumes in our banana  other fresh produce and the prepared food segments 
in the middle 
table of contents east  we expect to continue to increase our net sales of our fresh produce and prepared food product offerings as a result of our expansion in the saudi arabian and other regional markets 
we also expect to increase our sales by developing new products in the prepared food segment  targeting the convenience store and foodservice trade in selected european and middle east markets 
we also expect to continue to expand our sales of beverage products in the european and sub sahara african markets 
cost of products sold cost of products sold is principally composed of two elements  product and logistics costs 
product cost for our produce is primarily composed of cultivation the cost of growing crops  harvesting  packaging  labor  depreciation and farm administration 
product cost for produce obtained from independent growers is composed of produce and packaging costs 
logistics costs include land and sea transportation and expenses related to port facilities and distribution centers 
sea transportation cost is the most significant component of logistics costs and is comprised of the cost of vessel operating expenses and chartering refrigerated vessels 
vessel operating expenses for our owned vessels include operations  maintenance  depreciation  insurance  fuel the cost of which is subject to commodity price fluctuations  and port charges 
for chartered vessels  operating expenses include the cost of chartering the vessels  fuel and port charges 
variations in containerboard prices  which affect the cost of boxes and other packaging materials  and fuel prices can have a significant impact on our product cost and our profit margins 
also  variations in the production yields  fertilizers and other input costs and the cost to procure products from independent growers can have a significant impact on our costs 
containerboard  plastic  resin and fuel prices have historically been volatile 
during  cost of fuel increased by and containerboard increased by  increasing our cost of product sold by million 
in addition  we incurred million of increased costs for inventory write downs and other costs associated with exit activities in brazil  floods in guatemala and damages caused by an earthquake in chile  partially offset by insurance reimbursements 
during  cost of fuel increased by and containerboard decreased  increasing our cost of products sold by million 
in addition  we recorded a credit of million in related to insurance claims proceeds as a result of damages that occurred in from flooding in guatemala and an earthquake in chile and million in inventory write downs in central america as a result of our melon program rationalization and write down of packaging material and other inventory in one of our united kingdom fresh cut operations 
in general  changes in our volume of products sold can have a disproportionate effect on our gross profit 
within any particular year  a significant portion of our cost of products sold is fixed  both with respect to our operations and with respect to the cost of produce purchased from independent growers from whom we have agreed to purchase all the products they produce 
accordingly  higher volumes produced on company owned farms directly reduce the average per box cost  while lower volumes directly increase the average per box cost 
in addition  because the volume that will actually be produced on our farms and by independent growers in any given year depends on a variety of factors  including weather  that are beyond our control or the control of our independent growers  it is difficult to predict volumes and per box costs 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our costs are affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we have significant operations versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus those currencies resulting in increased costs 
during  cost of products sold was negatively impacted by approximately million as a result of a weaker us dollar versus the various currencies in which we have significant operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs associated with selling in countries where we have our own sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  professional fees  general corporate overhead and other related administrative functions 
gain on sales of property  plant and equipment gain on sales of property  plant and equipment was million in principally as a result of the sale of shipping related equipment and other surplus equipment 
in  the gain on sales of property  plant and equipment of million resulted primarily from the sale of four refrigerated vessels and properties in south america 
asset impairment and other charges  net asset impairment and other charges  net were million in as compared with million in  a decrease of million 
in  we recorded asset impairment and other charges totaling million primarily related to asset impairments and other charges as a result of our central american melon rationalization program  an under utilized fresh cut facility and distribution center in the united kingdom  our decision to abandon an isolated area in our banana operations in the philippines and a low productivity area in costa rica and legal costs in hawaii related to the kunia well site  partially offset by 
table of contents insurance claims proceeds related to damages that occurred in from flooding in guatemala and an earthquake in chile 
in  we recorded asset impairment and other charges totaling million related to plant disease affecting an isolated growing area in our banana operations in the philippines that was abandoned during the first quarter of  exit activities in south africa and brazil  damage caused by floods in our guatemala banana farms and an earthquake in chile  combined with an impairment charge of the del monte perpetual  royalty free brand name license for beverage products in the united kingdom due to lower than expected sales volume and pricing and the relocation of a port facility in north america 
in  we recorded asset impairment and other charges totaling million as a result of our decision to discontinue pineapple planting in brazil and our decision not to use certain property  plant and equipment as originally intended for other crop production 
during  we also incurred charges of million for termination benefits and contract termination costs resulting from our decision to discontinue our commercial cargo service in germany  a million impairment charge of the del monte perpetual  royalty free brand name license for beverage products in the united kingdom due to lower than expected sales volume and pricing and a million asset impairment charge related to an intangible asset for a non compete agreement as a result of the caribana acquisition 
these charges were partially offset by million of credits due to the reversal of contract termination costs as a result of the closure of an under utilized distribution center in the united kingdom  and the discontinuance of retiree medical benefits and the reversal of contract termination costs related to the closing of our hawaii pineapple operations 
also included in asset impairments and other charges  net  for was million of insurance recoveries related to the floods of our brazil banana operations 
interest expense interest expense consists primarily of interest on borrowings under working capital facilities that we maintain and interest on other long term debt primarily for capital lease obligations 
in  our interest expense declined  reflecting primarily lower interest rates and a decrease in our average outstanding debt  partially offset by by a write down of debt issuance costs as a result of our voluntary reduction of available borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  primarily consists of currency exchange gains or losses  equity gains and losses in unconsolidated companies and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
during  we recorded higher currency exchange losses as compared with the prior year 
provision for benefit from income taxes the provision for benefit from income taxes in was million and includes the establishment of reserves for uncertain tax positions in various foreign jurisdictions combined with increased taxable income  partially offset by a favorable adjustment as a result of a change in the tax treatment of plantation costs in a foreign jurisdiction 
income taxes consist of the consolidation of the tax provisions  computed on a separate entity basis  in each country in which we have operations 
since we are a non us company with substantial operations outside the united states  a substantial portion of our results of operations is not subject to us taxation 
several of the countries in which we operate have favorable tax rates 
we are subject to us taxation on our operations in the united states 
from time to time  tax authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate audit our tax returns and review our tax positions 
there are audits presently pending in various countries 
there can be no assurance that any tax audits  or changes in existing tax laws or interpretations in countries in which we operate  will not result in an increased effective tax rate for us
