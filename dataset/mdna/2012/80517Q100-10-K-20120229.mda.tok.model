item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on commercializing krystexxa in the united states  completing the development and seeking regulatory approval for this product outside of the united states  particularly in the european union  and investigating the expansion of the clinical utility for krystexxa 
in europe and the rest of the world we continue to see significant opportunity and great interest in krystexxa 
at the current time we do not plan to launch krystexxa on our own in europe or other markets  but will instead explore partnership opportunities in those regions 
krystexxa was approved for marketing by the us food and drug administration  or fda  on september  and became commercially available in the united states by prescription on december   when we commenced sales and shipments to our network of specialty and wholesale distributors 
we completed a full promotional launch of krystexxa in the united states during the first quarter of with our sales force commencing field promotion to physicians on february  krystexxa is indicated for the treatment of chronic gout in adult patients refractory to conventional therapy  a condition referred to as refractory chronic gout  or rcg 
rcg occurs in patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom these drugs are contraindicated 
krystexxa is not recommended for the treatment of an elevation of blood concentration of uric acid that is not accompanied by signs or symptoms of gout 
this condition is referred to as asymptomatic hyperuricemia 
gout develops when urate accumulates in the tissues and joints as a result of the elevation of the blood concentration of uric acid 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  in krystexxa is a pegylated uric acid specific enzyme that converts uric acid to allantoin  which is readily eliminated primarily through the kidney 
gout is usually associated with bouts of severe joint pain and disability  or gout flares  and deposits of crystalline urate in joints  skin or cartilage  which may occur in concentrated forms  or gout tophi 
uricase  an enzyme not naturally expressed in humans but present in other mammals  eliminates uric acid from the body by converting uric acid to allantoin  which is easily excreted by the kidney 
we believe that treatment with krystexxa  which is a pegylated form of uricase  eliminates hyperuricemia and provides clinical benefits by eliminating uric acid in the blood and tissue deposits of urate 
during the first quarter of  we worked together with a leading independent life science consulting firm to conduct a comprehensive market research study to determine the number of adult patients in the united states who are suffering from rcg  which we refer to as the krystexxa market study 
this study was conducted using both secondary data sources and primary market research 
the secondary data sources were used to quantify the diagnosed prevalent gout population and the treated gout population and included all available published literature  the national health and nutrition examination survey  or nhanes  the nationally representative survey sponsored by the united states centers for disease control and prevention  medicare claims data and commercial claims data 
the krystexxa market study was completed in july and indicated that there are approximately  rcg patients in the united states  which represents approximately of the overall annual treated gout population in the united states 
the total available market opportunity for krystexxa will ultimately depend on  among other things  our marketing and sales efforts  reimbursement environment  market acceptance by physicians  infusion site personnel  healthcare payors and others in the medical community  and referrals by various specialty physicians to administering clinicians 
the fda granted krystexxa an orphan drug designation in  which we expect will provide the drug with orphan drug marketing exclusivity in the united states until september  seven years from the date of its approval 
the composition  manufacture and methods of use and administration of krystexxa are also the subject of a broad portfolio of patents and patent applications  which we expect will provide patent protection through  assuming issuance of patents from currently pending patent applications 
to support the commercial launch of krystexxa  we have hired a sales force consisting of experienced biologic sales professionals  six regional business directors  six managed care executives  nurse 
table of contents educators and field reimbursement specialists 
to support the safe and effective use of krystexxa in the commercial setting  we expanded our medical affairs function with the hiring of field based regional medical scientists  or rmss  who educate clinicians through reactive presentations of the clinical data 
as we proceed forward through the promotional launch  we may increase the size of our sales force or medical affairs professionals  if necessary 
our sales force will allow us to target rheumatologists and nephrologists with access to infusion centers and healthcare institutions  each of which treat adult patients suffering from rcg 
to date  our sales force has reached over of our key rheumatologists  and of key nephrologists located in private practices  infusion centers  hospitals  academic institutions and the us department of veterans affairs  or the va  medical centers 
however  we believe that sales of krystexxa have been hampered by the lack of information available to prescribers at the time of the commercial launch of krystexxa and concerns over medicare part b reimbursement 
in an effort to address the lack of information available to prescribers  in august we published in the journal of the american medical association  or jama  data from our two pivotal krystexxa phase clinical trials in patients with rcg 
the data that were published in jama demonstrated that treatment with krystexxa resulted in significant and sustained reductions in uric acid levels along with clinical improvements in a substantial proportion of rcg patients for six months  a timeframe for demonstrating clinical improvement that is unique in randomized controlled studies of urate lowering therapies 
in addition  of patients with gout tophi receiving krystexxa every two weeks experience complete resolution of one or more tophi by the final study visit  compared to of patients on placebo 
the data published also included a summary of adverse events that occurred in at least of the patients in the trial  including gout flares  infusion reactions  nausea  contusion or ecchymosis  nasopharyngitis  constipation  chest pain  anaphylaxis and vomiting 
when we commenced sales of krystexxa  krystexxa was reimbursed under a temporary medicare part b reimbursement code  which can cause delays in medicare reimbursement to prescribers 
however  we received a permanent medicare part b reimbursement code  which is called a j code  in november  which became effective on january  the permanent j code  j  should facilitate reimbursement to providers who treat patients suffering with rcg and who rely on medicare and medicaid 
we also were awarded a contract from the va  which covered krystexxa reimbursement for va member patients as of april  at an approximate discount to our list selling price 
in addition  currently krystexxa enjoys broad coverage for rcg patients through managed care and private payor organizations 
in june  we implemented the krystexxa patient initiation program  or kpip  which provided rcg patients with two free doses of krystexxa for through september  we believe that this initiative allowed patients to begin therapy and experience the potential benefits of krystexxa with no or minimal out of pocket expense 
we may re introduce the kpip at a future date based on market conditions 
we implemented during various prescriber education programs  and we trained key opinion leaders  or kols  to educate other physicians and healthcare professionals on the safe and appropriate use of krystexxa 
in  we also completed speaker programs reaching approximately  healthcare professionals 
we have built an inventory of finished krystexxa product at december   that is packaged and labeled for distribution  and additional supplies of bulk api drug substance that are scheduled to be packaged and labeled as part of our ongoing fda approved commercial manufacturing process 
based on our inventory on hand and in process  we believe we have sufficient inventory to meet our internal market estimates until at least in december  the pediatric committee of the european medicines agency  or ema  approved our pediatric investigation plan for the treatment and prevention of hyperuricemia in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies  which is a condition to filing for marketing approval for krystexxa in the european union 

table of contents in support of our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for krystexxa outside of the united states  in may we submitted a marketing authorization application  or maa  for centralized review in the european union 
also in may  we received validation of the maa that was filed with the ema for krystexxa for the treatment of rcg in adult patients  which resulted in the initiation of the ema s regulatory review process 
we anticipate an ema approval of our maa for krystexxa during the second half of we expect krystexxa to be available in the european union on a named patient basis by the end of the first quarter of in further support of our efforts to launch krystexxa in europe  we have engaged rms s for our european region  commenced kol interactions and advanced the development of reimbursement and pricing plans for the region 
in addition  in january of  we announced the appointment of david veitch as president of our european subsidiary  savient pharma ireland limited 
mr 
veitch will lead our organization and efforts focused on kol development in key european markets  pre launch market and reimbursement development activities and commercial launch planning  as well as assisting us with our exploration of partnership opportunities in europe and the rest of the world 
we also sell and distribute branded and generic versions of oxandrolone  a drug used to promote weight gain following involuntary weight loss 
we launched our authorized generic version of oxandrolone in december in response to the approval and launch of generic competition to our branded product  oxandrin 
the introduction of oxandrolone generics has led to significant decreases in demand for oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone 
we believe that revenues from oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone will continue to decrease in future periods primarily as a result of the expiration of our contract agreement with our third party manufacturer 
we do not plan on seeking a new third party manufacturer of oxandrin or oxandrolone 
we currently operate within one specialty pharmaceutical segment  which includes sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone and the sales and research and development activities of krystexxa 
total revenues were million for year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
our consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with fair value determinations of assets and liabilities including the provisions for sales discounts and returns  depreciable and amortizable lives  recoverability of inventories  amounts recorded for contingencies  share based compensation assumptions  impairments of long lived assets and investments  and taxes on income 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe that the application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements 
disclosures about fair values of financial instruments 
we categorize our financial instruments into a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
if the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument 

table of contents financial assets recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets are categorized as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset 
level inputs include the following quoted prices for similar assets in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non active markets  inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means 
level prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
they reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset 
impairments of long lived assets 
we assess changes in economic  regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of our property  plant and equipment 
we periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values our long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets  or appropriate asset groupings  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists 
if the asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset s fair value and its carrying value 
for the years ended december   and  we did not experience or record any charges to operations related to impairments of long lived assets 
inventory valuation 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on actual cost 
an allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable 
if inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand  we record reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these reserves are recorded based upon various factors for our products  including the level of product manufactured by the company  the level of product in the distribution channel  current and projected product demand  the expected shelf life of the product and firm inventory purchase commitments 
for year ended december  we recorded a million charge for krystexxa inventory that we do not currently believe we will be able to sell prior to its expiration 
product revenue recognition 
we generate revenue from product sales 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product is recognized at the time of sale only if i the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  ii the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  iii the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  iv the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  v the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and vi the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
given our limited sales history for krystexxa coupled with the product being a new entry into its market  we believe that we are currently unable to reasonably estimate future product returns 
therefore  we have determined that the shipments of krystexxa made to specialty distributors do not meet the criteria for 
table of contents revenue recognition at the time of shipment  and  accordingly  such shipments are accounted for using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of krystexxa to specialty distributors 
for these product sales  we invoice the specialty distributor and record deferred revenue equal to the gross invoice price 
we then recognize revenue when krystexxa is sold through  or upon shipment of the product from the specialty distributors to their customers  including doctors and infusion sites 
because of the price of krystexxa  the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and limited product return rights  krystexxa distributors and their customers generally carry limited inventory 
we are also selling krystexxa to wholesalers whereby we drop ship the product directly to hospitals 
as there is limited risk of returns from hospitals as infusions will be taking place in their facilities  we are recording revenue when krystexxa has been received at the hospital and title has transferred in accordance with the terms of sale 
oxandrin product sales are generally recognized when title to the product has transferred to our customers in accordance with the terms of the sale 
we ship our authorized generic oxandrolone to our distributor and account for these shipments on a consignment basis until product is sold into the retail market 
we defer the recognition of revenue related to these shipments until we confirm that the product has been sold into the retail market and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our net product revenues represent gross product revenues less allowances for returns  medicaid rebates  other government rebates  discounts  and distribution fees 
allowances for returns 
in general  it is our policy to provide credit for product returns for krystexxa that are returned six months after the product expiration date and for oxandrin and generic oxandrolone that are returned six months prior to the product expiration date and twelve months after the product expiration date 
as noted above in our revenue recognition discussion  given our limited sales history for krystexxa coupled with the product being a new entry into its market  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate future product returns 
our product sales in the united states primarily relate to the following products product expiration in years krystexxa mg oxandrin and oxandrolone mg oxandrin and oxandrolone mg upon sale of oxandrin and oxandrolone  we estimate an allowance for future returns 
in order to reasonably estimate future returns  we analyze both quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to  actual return rates by lot productions  the level of product manufactured by us  the level of product in the distribution channel  expected shelf life of the product  current and projected product demand  the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand  and general economic and industry wide indicators 
the aggregate net product return allowance reserve for oxandrin and oxandrolone was million and million at december  and  respectively 
a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowance for product returns is as follows expense provisions actual deductions description balance at beginning of period related to current year sales related to prior period sales related to current year sales related to prior period sales other deductions balance at end of period in thousands allowance for sales returns 
table of contents allowances for medicaid and other government rebates 
our contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply system commit us to provide those agencies with its most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales of krystexxa and oxandrin and oxandrolone through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the aggregate net rebate accrual balances for krystexxa and oxandrin and oxandrolone were million at each respective year ended december  and a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowances for medicaid and other government rebates for oxandrin and oxandrolone is as follows expense provisions actual deductions description balance at beginning of period related to current year sales related to prior period sales related to current year sales related to prior period sales other deductions balance at end of period in thousands allowance for rebates share based compensation 
we have share based compensation plans in place and record the associated share based compensation expense over the requisite service period 
the share based compensation plans and related compensation expense are discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
compensation expense for service based stock options is charged against operations on a straight line basis between the grant date for the option and the vesting period  which is generally four years 
we estimate the fair value of all service based stock option awards as of the grant date by applying the black scholes option pricing valuation model 
the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective  judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation cost 
compensation cost is adjusted for estimated pre vesting forfeitures 
options granted have a term of years from the grant date 
restricted stock and restricted stock units  or rsu s  that are service based are recorded as deferred compensation and amortized into compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which ranges from three to four years in duration 
compensation cost for service based restricted stock and rsu s is based on the grant date fair value of the award  which is the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
compensation expense for restricted stock and stock option awards that contain performance conditions  the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of various sales and other specific strategic objectives for senior management  is based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards that contain performance conditions is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
for performance stock options  we utilize a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the grant date fair value 
compensation expense for restricted stock and stock option awards that contain performance conditions is recorded over the implicit or explicit requisite service period based on management s assumptions of when the awards are expected to vest 
previously recognized compensation expense for restricted stock and stock option awards that contain performance conditions is fully reversed if performance targets are not satisfied 
we continually assess the probability of the attainment of performance conditions and adjust compensation expense accordingly over the remainder of the requisite service period 
compensation cost for restricted stock and stock option awards that contain a market condition is based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we utilize a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the grant date fair value 
compensation expense is recorded over the implicit  explicit or derived service period 

table of contents income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  applicable tax strategies  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in  based on the net operating loss generated in and historical losses and the uncertainty of profitability in the near future  we concluded that we would maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities and those assets that are reserved by a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we use judgment in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax positions 
additional provisions for income taxes are established when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
we are examined by federal and state tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
results of operations during  and  our operating results were driven by substantial expenses relating to the research and development related to and the commercialization of krystexxa resulting in net operating losses 
we anticipate continued substantial expenses relating to the commercialization and further development of krystexxa through our expenses relating to the commercialization and development of krystexxa will depend on many factors  including the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of post approval marketing related clinical studies  the cost of our post approval commitments to the fda  including an observational study and a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  program  and the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for krystexxa in countries other than the united states 
during  and  the expenses associated with our regulatory  clinical  manufacturing and commercial development of krystexxa were the most significant factors affecting our results of operations 
the following table summarizes our costs and expenses and indicates the significance of selling  general and administrative costs related to our commercialization of krystexxa  as well as percentage of total cost of expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands cost of goods sold research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses 
table of contents our revenues of million for were derived primarily from product sales of krystexxa and to a lesser extent  sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone 
our authorized generic version of oxandrin  our revenues of million for were derived primarily from oxandrin and oxandrolone and our revenues in were derived exclusively from oxandrin and oxandrolone 
following the full commercial launch of krystexxa in february  sales levels have increased and we expect sales of krystexxa to continue to drive increases in overall revenues during and in future years 
as a result of the increased competition to oxandrin and oxandrolone from other generic oxandrolone products and our decision not to renew our manufacturing agreements related to those products  we expect our oxandrin and authorized generic oxandrolone products to decrease in and in future periods  and we expect oxandrin revenues to be of diminished significance to our results of operations 
our future revenues depend on our success in the commercialization of krystexxa including whether we are successful in marketing and selling krystexxa after the full commercial launch of the product  market acceptance of krystexxa by physicians and patients in this largely previously untreated patient population  market acceptance of the price that we charge for krystexxa and under what conditions private and public payors will reimburse patients for krystexxa  whether and to what extent our label expansion activities for krystexxa are successful  whether and when we face generic or other competition with respect to krystexxa  the timing and costs of regulatory approval for krystexxa in any countries other than the united states  and our ability to maintain a sufficient inventory of krystexxa to meet commercial demand 
the following table summarizes net product sales of our commercialized products and their percentage of total net product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands krystexxa oxandrolone oxandrin results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to incremental krystexxa sales of million resulting from the full commercial launch of krystexxa in february of sales of oxandrolone  our authorized generic version of oxandrin  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the higher sales of oxandrolone were offset by a million decrease in net sales of our branded product oxandrin as compared to the prior year  due to lower overall demand for the product as a result of increased generic competition 

table of contents we expect that sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone will continue to decline in future periods due to the continued impact of generic competition coupled with the expiration of our agreement with our third party manufacturer of these products 
we do not plan on seeking a new third party manufacturer of oxandrin and oxandrolone 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold is primarily due to a million charge to reserve for krystexxa inventory that we do not currently believe we will be able to sell prior to its expiration 
in addition  as a result of the commercialization and commencement of sales of krystexxa in  we are required to make royalty and sales based milestone payments under our third party supply and license and agreements 
royalty and sales based milestone payments pursuant to these agreements resulted in approximately million of incremental expense for the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily because of the non recurrence of the million in costs resulting from our conformance batch campaign at our potential secondary source supplier of pegloticase drug substance that we incurred in the year ended december  partially offsetting the above decreases in costs are higher expenses associated with our krystexxa fda post marketing commitment studies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses associated with the commercial launch of krystexxa as we continue our marketing efforts for the product 
also contributing to the increase in costs is higher headcount compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the hiring of our krystexxa sales force  reimbursement specialists  nurse educators and managed care specialists 
interest expense on convertible notes interest expense was million for the year ended december   consisting of million of interest expense from the coupon on our senior convertible notes due  or the convertible notes  issued in february and million of non cash accretion of the debt discount  also associated with our convertible notes 
other income expense  net other income expense  net reflects million of income for the year ended december  as compared to million of expense for the year ended december   a net positive change of million 
other income  net for the year ended december  reflects a current year benefit to income as a result of a million benefit for accrued interest and penalties relating to the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit liability and a million reversal of a liability for accrued interest and penalties relating to a state sales and use tax audit 
partially offsetting these benefits to income is a charge against income of million as a result of the amortization of deferred financing costs on our convertible notes 
the million of expense for the year ended december  substantially represents the mark to market adjustment on our previous warrant liability  which was settled in its entirety during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents income tax benefit the income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately zero for the year ended december   was primarily comprised of a million income tax benefit that was the result of the recognition of a deferred tax asset equal to the deferred tax liability associated with the issuance of the convertible notes 
the balance of the net income tax benefit was the result of a reduction in a liability for unrecognized state tax benefits of million  which was considered effectively settled due to the completion of a state corporate income tax audit in the first quarter and a liability reduction of million for other related state tax matters 
the million tax benefit recorded does not result in additional cash flow for the company 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  gross sales of oxandrin decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower overall demand for the product as a result of increased generic competition 
net sales of oxandrin increased by million for the year ended december  versus the same period in  due primarily to higher prior year actual experience adjustments relating to reserves for product returns and government and customer rebates 
oxandrolone generated lower net sales for the year ended december   decreasing million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the lower sales of oxandrolone resulted from increased generic competition 
we expect that sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone will continue to decline in future periods due to the continued impact of generic competition coupled with the expiration of our agreement with our third party supplier of these products 
krystexxa generated minimal sales during primarily because it was only made available to the marketplace during the month of december cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   mainly due to failed batches of krystexxa produced at bio technology general israel ltd  or btg  during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily a result of large research and development costs incurred in the year ended december  that did not recur in the year ended december   including million related to an amendment to our services agreement with merck  million of expenses related to our preparation for our june fda advisory committee meeting for krystexxa  and million in capital expenditures associated with improvements made by btg to its manufacturing facility 
in addition  research and development expenses in the year ended december  included million in higher investigator grants and outside laboratory services costs 
table of contents associated with the wind down of our open label extension  or ole  clinical study 
severance expense also decreased by million as a result of costs incurred in the period in connection with our september reduction in force initiative 
also contributing to the decreased costs were million in lower expenses related to a higher amount of commercial and validation batches manufactured at btg during partially offsetting the decreased expenses was an increase of million in costs associated with the validation manufacturing campaign at merck to potentially become our secondary source supplier of pegloticase drug substance 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was partially due to certain marketing costs incurred during the year ended december  that did not recur in the year ended december   including million associated with the preparation for a possible commercial launch of krystexxa in additionally  the lower costs reflected a decrease of million in compensation related and severance expenses as a result of the reduction in force implemented in september additionally  our outside legal costs in support of the shareholder class action litigation decreased by million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  investment income expense  net investment income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a realized gain of million recorded during the year ended december  resulting from redemptions of our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio 
other income expense  net other expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the mark to market valuation adjustment to our warrant liability in the current year which resulted in a million loss due to the appreciation in fair market value of our warrants 
the appreciation in fair market value of the warrants during the year ended december  resulted from a higher price per share of our common stock 
additionally  we recorded a million loss on the mark to market valuation adjustment to our warrant liability during the year ended december  resulting from appreciation in the fair market value of our warrants during the prior year 
all of the warrants have been exercised and none remained outstanding as of december  income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased million to zero for the year ended december   from a benefit of million for the year ended december  the decrease of benefit in is a direct result of our inability to carry back losses to previous years to recover previously paid taxes 
it is uncertain whether we will be able to utilize the net operating losses generated in against future income 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december  we primarily invest our cash equivalents and short term investments in highly liquid  interest bearing  us treasury money market funds and bank certificates of deposit in order to preserve principal 
in february  we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due we received cash proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes of million  net of expenses 

table of contents we have used and will continue to use in the future  the net proceeds of the issuance of the convertible notes to commercialize krystexxa in the united states  including for the recruiting and hiring of our sales force  expanding our marketing organization and completing the establishment of a commercial infrastructure  increasing our promotional activities  funding of clinical development activities directed to potential label expansion for krystexxa in the united states  to further develop and seek regulatory approval for krystexxa in jurisdictions outside the united states particularly in the european union  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
as a result  our management has broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from the offering 
pending the application of the net proceeds  we invest the net proceeds in short term us treasury money market funds and bank certificates of deposit 
based on our current commercialization plans for krystexxa  including our anticipated expenses relating to sales and marketing activities  the cost of purchasing additional inventory  the cost of clinical development activities directed to potential label expansion for krystexxa in the united states  the cost of pursuing regulatory approval in the european union  and the cost of pre launch market  reimbursement and kol development activities in the european union  and assuming that we are able to generate krystexxa revenues at the level that we are currently expecting but excluding any cash which may be generated from the consummation of a partnership transaction for europe or other markets  we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund anticipated levels of operations at least through april  our management has broad discretion in the use of our financial resources and may adjust our anticipated plans as circumstances warrant 
we believe we have sufficient quantities of krystexxa to complete a commercial launch in accordance with our launch plan 
we have built an inventory of finished krystexxa product at december   that is packaged and labeled for distribution and additional supplies of bulk api drug substance that are scheduled to be packaged and labeled as part of our ongoing fda approved commercial manufacturing process 
based on our inventory on hand and in process  we now believe we have sufficient inventory to meet our internal market estimates until at least cash flows cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  primarily reflects our net loss for the period of million 
cash used in investing activities of million during the year ended december  reflects the purchase of held to maturity securities consisting of bank certificates of deposit 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million mainly due to the cash proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible notes of million 
cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  reflects our net loss for the period of million partially offset by a net non cash adjustment of million as a result of the mark to market valuation of our warrant liability 
we used million of cash in investment activities relating primarily to the purchase of held to maturity securities encompassing bank certificates of deposit 
we also received million in cash from financing activities  mainly due to the issuance of common stock  including million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants 
funding requirements we are now focusing our efforts on commercializing krystexxa  completing the development and seeking regulatory approval outside of the united states for krystexxa  particularly in the european union  undertaking clinical trials and other research and development activities to pursue label expansion for krystexxa and building our commercial infrastructure in europe 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including whether we are successful in marketing and selling krystexxa  the cost of our post approval commitments to the fda  including an observational study and a rems program  
table of contents the cost of clinical trials directed to potential expansion of clinical utility opportunities for krystexxa  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the cost of manufacturing activities  market acceptance of krystexxa by physicians and patients in this largely previously untreated patient population  market acceptance of the price that we charge for krystexxa and under what conditions private and public payors will reimburse patients for krystexxa  and the timing and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for krystexxa in countries other than the united states 
as we continue with the commercialization of krystexxa  we expect that our cash needs will increase  and we may need to seek additional funding through customary methods  or to explore a strategic licensing or co promotion transaction in certain territories as a means of raising additional funding 
should we elect to seek additional funding through customary methods  we may not be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  such funding may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
if we issue preferred stock  it would likely include a liquidation preference and other terms that would adversely affect our common stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings  we may incur substantial interest expense and could become subject to financial and other covenants that could restrict our ability to take specified actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
if we explore a strategic licensing or co promotion transaction  one may not be available to us or may only be available on terms that are not acceptable to us 
if funds are not available on favorable terms  or at all  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected and we may be required to curtail or cease operations
