prior to december   the company s businesses consolidated into two reportable business segments 
the investment periodicals and related publications retail and institutional and fees from copyright data including the proprietary ranking system information and other proprietary information consolidate into one segment called publishing and the investment management services to the value line funds and other managed accounts were consolidated into a second business segment called investment management 
subsequent to december   the date of the restructuring transaction  the publishing segment constitutes the company s only reportable business segment 
restructuring of asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses the company completed the restructuring of its asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses the restructuring transaction on december  the restructuring date and executed the eam declaration of trust the eam declaration of trust 
as part of the restructuring transaction eulav securities  inc esi  a new york corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the company that acted as the distributor of the thirteen value line funds was restructured into eulav securities llc es  a delaware limited liability company  the company transferred of its interest in es to eulav asset management llc eam llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that acted as the investment adviser to the value line funds and certain separate accounts  eam llc was converted into eam  and eam admitted five individuals the voting profits interest holders  as the initial holders of voting profits interests in eam  with each of such individuals owning of the voting profits interests of eam  and pursuant to the eam declaration of trust  the company received an interest in certain revenues of eam and a portion of the residual profits of eam but has no voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of eam

business environment for the twelve months ended april   the nasdaq and the dow jones industrial average were up and  respectively 
however  we believe that the severe downturn experienced in the september to march period and the continued volatility in the financial markets since then have resulted in many individual investors withdrawing money from equity investments  including equity mutual funds  and that this risk averse temperament of investors continues to restrain both the company s revenues from its research periodicals and publications and the company s cash flows from its non voting revenues and non voting profits interests in eam

investment periodicals and related publications revenues investment periodicals and related publications revenues were down  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to fiscal while the company continued its efforts to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels  primarily direct mail and the internet for retail users  and by the efforts of our sales personnel in the institutional market  total product line circulation at april  was lower than total product line circulation at april  factors that have contributed to the decline in the investment periodicals and related publications revenues include competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no direct cost to their clients 
core subscriber renewal rates for the flagship product  the value line investment survey  are  down from for fiscal the company is not adding enough new subscribers to offset the subscribers that choose not to renew this product 
the company has been successful in growing revenues from digitally delivered investment periodicals within institutional sales 
gross institutional sales orders of  for the twelve months ended april   were  or above comparable sales orders of  for the twelve months ended april  this increase continues a positive growth trend for institutional sales  but is not sufficient to wholly offset the lost revenues from retail subscribers

the decrease in digital retail publications revenues is primarily attributable to the decrease in circulation within the company s software products 
the majority of the company s subscribers have traditionally been individual investors who generally receive printed publications via us mail on a weekly basis 
consistent with the experience of other print publishers in many fields  the company has found that its roster of customers has been declining as individuals migrate to various digital services 
individual investors interested in digitally delivered investment information have access to free equity research from many sources 
for example  most retail broker dealers with computerized trading services offer their customers free or low cost research services that compete with the company s services 
revenues from the company s current retail online services have also declined because many competing products offer more dynamic features 
the company believes that the continued volatility of the equity market and the modest pace of the recovery experienced since the severe economic downturn in the period from september to march have to some extent eroded retail investor interest in equities  which has accounted for some of the decline in revenues from the company s publications 
the company also believes that the negative trend in overall subscription revenue is likely to continue until new products  and in particular new products designed for professional investors  have been developed and marketed 
the company has established the goal of developing competitive digital products and marketing them effectively through traditional as well as internet and social channels 
towards that end  the company has been modernizing legacy information technology systems 
the company is not able to predict when these efforts will result in the launch of new products or whether they will be successful in reversing the trend of declining retail publishing revenues 
during fiscal  the company launched a refreshed web site that previews the delivery of the company s digital research products  including analysis of covered securities  current economic conditions and expert research 
the launch of the refreshed website allows for easier navigation through the vast array of products and research provided by the company 
value line has redesigned its retail investor website with a new format and more user friendly navigation of features 
single sign on sso and the new shopping cart are among the features launched with the redesigned retail website 
the sso offers tighter security and automation of customer administrative tasks  acts as a gatekeeper to the fulfillment system  and allows full automation of the renewal series and promotional offerings 
sso will also assist the company in offering product variations expeditiously 
during fiscal  the company also implemented a new fulfillment system  which is licensed from a third party 
all print subscription properties and all web based digital services are now managed and fulfilled by the new fulfillment system 
this database gives the company the ability to centrally manage customer acquisition  fulfillment and online digital access 
in connection with the launch of the new fulfillment system licensed from a third party and the new shopping cart  value line has enhanced its level of security standards for payment card and data security 
in march  the company launched a new institutional sales website valuelinepro 
com 
valuelinepro 
com provides a dedicated internet destination for investment advisers  portfolio managers  corporate professionals and library patrons and seeks to educate this target audience as to how value line s proprietary research tools can help them research stocks  mutual funds  options  convertible securities and etfs 
the site thoroughly describes each of the company s customized products available to institutions and investment professionals  and is designed to complement the company s sales and marketing efforts to institutions 
copyright data fees the value line proprietary ranking system information the ranking system  a component of the company s flagship product  the value line investment survey  is also utilized in the company s copyright data business 
the ranking system is also required to be made available to eam for specific uses without charge or expense 
the ranking system is designed to be predictive over a six to twelve month period 
for the twelve month period ended april   the combined ranking system rank stocks declined by  allowing for weekly changes in ranks  comparing unfavorably to an increase of in the s p index during the same period 
for the six months ended april   the combined ranking system rank stocks gained  underperforming the s p index s increase of during the same period 
during the twelve months ended april   copyright data fees of  were above copyright data fees for fiscal as of april   total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data representing billion in various products  as compared to four contracts and billion in assets at april   representing a decrease in assets 
the company believes the growth of this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the value line trademarks and proprietary research for their products 
this market has become significantly more competitive as a result of product diversification and increased use of indices by portfolio managers 
there was no net change in the number of revenue producing accounts during the twelve months ended april   while one account was added and one lost during fiscal management is focusing on the copyright data selling cycle  while maintaining good communications with current third party sponsors  although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
copyright data fees increased  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to fiscal as of april   total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data representing billion in various products  as compared to four contracts and billion in assets at the end of fiscal  representing a increase in assets 
investment management fees and services as of the restructuring date  the company deconsolidated its asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses and its interest in these businesses was restructured as a non voting revenues and non voting profits interests in eam 
accordingly  the company no longer reports this operation as a separate business segment  although it still maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and will receive ongoing payments in respect of its non voting revenues and non voting profits interests  as discussed below

as of april   ten of the thirteen value line funds have all or a portion of the b fees being waived  three of the thirteen funds have partial investment management fee waivers in place and  effective june   value line us government money market fund usgmmf discontinued the b program 
although  under the terms of the eam declaration of trust  the company no longer receives or shares in the revenues from b distribution fees  the company could benefit from the fee waivers to the extent that the resulting reduction of expense ratios and enhancement of the performance of the value line funds attracts new assets 
as of april   four of the six value line equity mutual funds  excluding sam and centurion  had an overall four or five star rating by morningstar  inc the largest distribution channel for the value line funds remains the fund supermarket platforms such as guardian  charles schwab co  inc  fidelity  pershing and e trade

the decline in usgmmf aum during fiscal was due primarily to redemptions arising from the value line profit sharing plan vlpsp liquidation of its account of approximately million in may  which resulted from a change in the investment options made available under the vlpsp 
from november on  management fees from the usgmmf were zero because eam had waived all fees for the fund management  and  because of the historically low interest rate environment  had substantially subsidized the usgmmf expenses 
at the value line mutual funds shareholder meeting held on december   the convertible fund shareholders approved the merger of the value line convertible fund into the value line income and growth fund  effective december  the value line convertible fund had approximately million in assets under management as of december  on may   the vl new york tax exempt trust million aum combined into the vl tax exempt fund million aum 
this increased the aum in the vl tax exempt fund over million  which is an important milestone to raise assets  since many institutions do not invest in funds under million 
both combinations offer many benefits for fund shareholders as described in the proxy materials 
eam is anticipating leaving the money market business in august the current plan approved by the fund board in june  calls for the money market fund to merge into a third party fund 
eam would continue to maintain the shareholder accounts on behalf of the value line money market fund usgmmf shareholders  but eam would no longer be subsidizing the expenses of the existing fund resulting from the low interest rate economic environment  saving over  annually 
in addition  closure or merger of the usgmmf would eliminate certain costs of administration and fund accounting  increasing the total annual savings

critical accounting estimates and policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent  and the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition income taxes reserve for settlement expenses revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenues come from the sale of print and digital subscriptions and fees for copyright proprietary information  and  prior to december   investment management and b fees 
the company recognizes subscription revenue  net of discounts  in equal amounts over the term of the subscription  which generally ranges from three months to one year or longer  varying based on the product or service 
copyright data fees are calculated monthly based on market fluctuation and billed quarterly 
prior to the restructuring date  december   investment management fee and b fee revenues for the value line funds were recognized each month based upon the daily net asset value of each fund 
the company believes that the estimates related to revenue recognition are critical accounting estimates  and to the extent that there are material differences between its determination of revenues and actual results  its financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
income taxes the company s effective annual income tax expense rate is based on the us federal and state and local jurisdiction tax rates on income and losses that are part of its consolidated financial statements 
tax planning opportunities and the blend of business income  including income derived from the company s non voting revenue and non voting profits interests in eam and income from securities transactions  will impact the effective tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s tax returns the company s cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as non taxable income that is not includable in the company s tax return and expenses that are not deductible in the company s tax return and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation and amortization expenses 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of april  and  the company had  and  respectively  of deferred tax assets  which included  and  of short term deferred federal  state  and local taxes  respectively  related to the net operating loss carryforwards of  and million respectively 
in assessing the company s deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or utilized in the company s tax filings 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets the company determines a lesser allowance is required  the company would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause the company s income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
in addition  the company establishes reserves at the time that it determines that it is more likely than not that it will need to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
the company adjusts these reserves  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
such liabilities are recorded as income taxes payable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which the company has previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to the company s income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
reserve for settlement expenses as of april  and  the company had  and  respectively  reserved for expected expenses related to the sec settlement 
the amount of the reserve for expected expense is an estimate of the expected cost of the administration of the fair fund established by the sec to reimburse shareholders who owned shares in the affected value line funds in the period covered by the settlement and other related costs 
included in the estimate were calculations for the third party administrator appointed in september by the sec  the tax advisor named in november by the sec  legal fees  and transfer agent fees  and communication expense required to identify and notify eligible shareholders as well as other costs associated with the calculation and distribution of the proceeds of the fair fund 
these costs were estimated based on the scope of the work and bids received from the third party vendors 
due to the complexity of the fair fund distribution  these estimates were subject to change 
during fiscal  as a result of modification in the manner of administration of the fair fund  the company reduced its estimate of the costs required to administer the fair fund by  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had increased such estimate by  off balance sheet arrangements the company is not party to any off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases in the ordinary course of business  which is disclosed below in the table of contractual obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks 
the company s market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s investment activities 
interest rate risk the company s strategy has historically been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk and low price risk 
despite this objective  management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur 
to limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes  the company s management historically invested primarily in short term obligations maturing in less than one year 
at april   the company did not have investments in securities with fixed maturities and therefore does not have any interest rate risk

market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the company s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diverse industry group 
the portfolio consists primarily of etfs and select common stock holdings of blue chip companies with a concentration on large capitalization companies with high relative dividend yields 
in order to maintain liquidity in these securities  the company s policy has been to invest in and hold in its portfolio  no more than of the approximate average daily trading volume in any one issue 
additionally  the company may purchase and hold non leveraged etfs whose performance inversely corresponds to the market value changes of investments in other etf securities held in the equity portfolio for dividend yield
