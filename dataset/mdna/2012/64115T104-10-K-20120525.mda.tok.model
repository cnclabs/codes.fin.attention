table of contents results overview we saw continued growth during the fiscal year ended march   with product revenue growth of and overall revenue growth of compared to the prior fiscal year 
bookings increased by during the fiscal year ended march  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
our total bookings for the service provider sector increased by during the fiscal year ended march  as a result of our investment and expansion in that sector on a global basis  as well as long term evolution lte deployments from the major global carriers 
our total bookings for the financial sector grew when compared to the prior fiscal year despite a weakness in this sector within the european region 
we ended fiscal year with million of product backlog  compared to an immaterial amount as of the end of fiscal year at march   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
this represents a decrease of million over the previous fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   we maintained our liquidity despite acquisitions of product technology as well as cash outflows as a result of our share repurchase program 
use of non gaap financial measures from time to time in press releases regarding quarterly earnings  presentations and other communications  we may provide financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with gaap 
recent non gaap financial measures have included non gaap revenue  income from operations  net income and net income per diluted share  which were adjusted from amounts determined based on gaap to exclude the effect of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue resulting from our acquisitions  to eliminate the revenue impact of adopted accounting guidance  to remove share based compensation expenses  certain business development and integration expenses  compensation for post combination services resulting from our acquisitions  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  restructuring charges and loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of related income tax effects 
management regularly uses supplemental non gaap financial measures internally to understand  manage and evaluate its business and to make operating decisions 
these non gaap measures are among the primary factors that management uses in planning and forecasting future periods 
management believes these non gaap financial measures enhance the reader s overall understanding of netscout s current financial performance and its prospects for the future by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain financial measures and providing a level of disclosure that helps investors understand how netscout plans and measures its business 
we believe that providing these non gaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to our peer companies and against prior periods by enabling investors to consider our operating results on both a gaap and non gaap basis 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with gaap  should not be considered an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and may have limitations in that they do not reflect all our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered superior to  in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

the application of these policies involves significant judgments and estimates by us 
marketable securities we account for our investments in accordance with authoritative guidance 
under the provisions  we have classified our investments as available for sale which are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices and associated unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents typically consist of money market instruments  commercial paper with a maturity of three months or less and cash maintained with various financial institutions 
marketable securities generally consist of us treasury bills  commercial paper with an original maturity of greater than three months  us government bonds  certificates of deposit  agency bonds  corporate bonds  auction rate securities and municipal bonds 
long term marketable securities consist of auction rate securities  us treasury bills  corporate bonds and certificates of deposit 
the auction rate securities we hold are all collateralized by student loans with underlying support by the federal government through the federal family education loan program ffelp and by monoline insurance companies 
auction rate securities typically were stated at par value prior to february due to liquidity provided through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on auction rate securities  the failure of these auctions has created illiquidity 
as a result  par value no longer approximates the estimated fair value of auction rate securities 
a discounted cash flow model was used to determine the estimated fair value of our investments in auction rate securities as of march  and the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  a 
table of contents liquidity risk premium and expected holding periods of the investments 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of march  we have recorded a cumulative decline in the fair value of auction rate securities of thousand thousand net of tax which was deemed temporary 
assumptions used to value these securities and in determining the temporary nature of this impairment require significant judgment by management 
changes in the assumptions could result in materially different estimates of fair values and the failure of these securities to return to par value or a decision by management to sell these securities at a loss could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on how the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration using its best estimate selling price of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence tpe of selling price  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after april  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the following reflects our policy for revenue recognition 
product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products which include required embedded software that works together with the hardware to deliver the hardware s essential functionality  licensing of our software products  and sale of hardware bundled with a software license 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
because many of our solutions are comprised of both hardware and more than incidental software components  we recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative guidance on both hardware and software revenue recognition 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide software and hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over the support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software warranty expiration  typically for month periods 
support services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available  telephone and internet based support  updates and bug fixes 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the support period 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue  with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue 
training services include on site and classroom training 
training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 
generally  our contracts are accounted for individually 
however  when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other  it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

table of contents multi element arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements comprised only of hardware products and related services  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to the multiple elements based on each element s selling price compared to the total relative selling price of all the elements 
each element s selling price is based on management s best estimate of selling price besp paid by customers based on the element s historical pricing when vsoe or tpe does not exist 
we have established besp for product elements as the average selling price the element was sold for over the past six quarters  whether sold alone or sold as part of a multiple element transaction 
our internal list price for products  reviewed quarterly by senior management  with consideration in regards to changing factors in our technology and in the marketplace  is generated to target the desired gross margin from sales of product after analyzing historical discounting trends 
we review sales of the product elements on a quarterly basis and update  when appropriate  besp for such elements to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience 
we have established vsoe for services related undelivered elements 
for multi element arrangements comprised only of software products and related services  we allocate a portion of the total arrangement consideration to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements 
the remaining portion of the total arrangement consideration is allocated to the delivered software  referred to as the residual method 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
we review the separate sales of the undelivered elements on a quarterly basis and update  when appropriate  its vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience 
if we cannot objectively determine the vsoe of the fair value of any undelivered software element  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
for multi element arrangements comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements  the total arrangement consideration is bifurcated between the hardware and hardware related deliverables and the software and software related deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all deliverables as a group 
then  arrangement consideration for the hardware and hardware related services is recognized upon delivery or as the related services are provided outlined above and revenue for the software and software related services is allocated following the residual method and recognized based upon delivery or as the related services are provided 
our product is distributed through our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels through alliances with resellers 
revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sell in basis  that is  when we deliver the product to the reseller 
we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller 
we do not offer contractual rights of return  stock balancing  or price protection to our resellers  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
in addition  we have history of successfully collecting receivables from the resellers 
as a result  we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
during the fiscal year ended march   we adopted authoritative guidance that allows us to utilize a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
this authoritative guidance permits us to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than its carrying value 
because netscout  and its one reporting unit  did not experience any significant adverse changes in its business or reporting structures  we performed the qualitative step assessment 
in performing the qualitative step assessment  we considered certain events and circumstances specific to the entity as a whole  such as 
table of contents macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance and cost factors when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
no indicators of impairment were noted as of january  additionally  the market capitalization of netscout as a whole significantly exceeded its carrying value 
the carrying value of intangible assets was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  except for the acquired tradename which resulted from the network general acquisition  which has an indefinite life and thus  is not amortized 
the carrying value of the indefinite lived tradename is evaluated annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
netscout completed its annual impairment test of the indefinite lived intangible as of january  as part of the impairment test  the fair value of the asset was compared to its book value  million 
the indefinite lived intangible asset fair value was estimated using the discounted cash flow method and included assumptions on revenue forecasts earned using the tradename  royalty rate and weighted average cost of capital rate 
these estimates were based on historical performance and projections of future revenue and inputs used in current valuations performed for acquisitions made in fiscal year the resulting fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset was greater than its carrying value 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis and varied each one of the estimated inputs into the impairment test and noted a change in any of the inputs by would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value and therefore would not require an impairment charge to be recognized 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
based on historical experience  we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our directors  and an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our senior executives and remaining employees 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated

our reported international revenue does not include any revenue from sales to customers outside the united states that are shipped to our united states based indirect channel partners 
these domestic resellers fulfill customer orders based upon joint selling efforts in conjunction with our direct sales force and may subsequently ship our products to international locations  however  we report these shipments as united states revenue since we ship the products to a domestic location

the federal research and development credit was re enacted on december  as part of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of hr

as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
commitment and contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is reasonably possible but not probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred or if the amount of a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  then in accordance with the authoritative guidance  we disclose the amount or range of estimated loss if the amount or range of estimated loss is material 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment

table of contents as disclosed in item  in march  we uncovered and investigated  and in april  disclosed to the us department of justice and the california state attorney general potential violations of federal and california state anti trust laws 
the potential violations involve a former employee and one or more third parties in connection with sales to state governmental agencies during fiscal year we believe we did not benefit from any of the transactions uncovered and that the amounts involved are not believed at this time to be material 
it is possible that the us department of justice and or the california state attorney general may conduct an investigation into the matter 
we are cooperating fully and intend to provide any requested information if asked 
in general  the federal and state agencies have the authority to seek fines and other remedies for anti trust violations  however  no charges or proceedings have been initiated by any governmental agency against netscout 
we determined that it is probable that there will be amounts due  those amounts are reasonably estimable and have been accrued as an immaterial liability as of march  backlog our combined product backlog at march   consisting of unshipped orders and deferred product revenue  was million compared to an immaterial amount at march  due to the fact that most if not all of our customers have the contractual ability to cancel unshipped orders prior to shipment we cannot provide assurance that our product backlog at any point in time will ultimately become revenue

cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities consist of the following in thousands as of march  cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march   we had a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by keybank national association keybank which provides us with a million revolving credit facility  which may be increased to million at any time up to days before maturity 
the revolving credit facility includes a swing line loan sub facility of up to million and a letter of credit sub facility of up to million 
the credit facility matures on november  at march   million was outstanding under the credit facility

swing line loans will bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable base rate margin 
beginning with the delivery of our financial statements for the quarter ended december   the applicable margin began to vary depending on our leverage ratio  ranging from basis points for base rate loans and basis points for eurodollar rate loans if netscout s consolidated leverage ratio is to or higher  down to basis points for base rate loans and basis points for eurodollar rate loans if our consolidated leverage ratio is to or less 
our consolidated leverage ratio is the ratio of its total funded debt compared to its consolidated adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda

as of march   we were in compliance with all covenants 

table of contents cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities decreased by million from march  to march  while cash and cash equivalents increased by million  short and long term marketable securities decreased in total by million 
our long term marketable securities include investments in auction rate securities 
beginning in february and continuing through march   auctions have failed resulting in a lack of short term liquidity for these securities  which has caused us to classify million as long term on our consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining million was reported as short term reflecting redemption notices for certain of our auction rate securities at par value which will occur in june as of march   our auction rate securities consisted of three positions issued by municipal agencies with a total par value of million and a current estimated market value totaling million 
the auction rate securities held by netscout at march  have maturity dates ranging from december through june as of march   the portion of the securities reported as long term were all aaa rated 
these securities are collateralized by student loans with underlying support by the federal government through the ffelp and by monoline insurance companies 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery in the auction process or other liquidity event occurs 
the fair value of these securities has been estimated by management based on the assumptions disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to analyze our auction rate securities each reporting period for impairment  and we may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market and economic conditions  including changes in market rates  the estimated timing until a liquidity event  the discount factor associated with illiquidity and the credit ratings of our securities 
there is no assurance as to when liquidity will return to this investment class  and therefore  we continue to monitor and evaluate these securities 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not expect the lack of liquidity in these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan

liquidity we believe that our cash balances  short term marketable securities classified as available for sale and future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled interest payments on our debt for at least the next months 
if demand for our product were to decrease substantially  our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure needs could be materially impacted

from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies such as our acquisitions of psytechnics on april   replay on october  and simena on november  if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of illiquidity of auction rate securities  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our auction rate securities are stated at fair value based on risk adjusted discounted cash flow calculations 
prior to february  these securities typically were stated at par value 
while we continue to earn interest on auction rate securities at the maximum contractual rate  these securities are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  par value no longer approximates the estimated fair value of auction rate securities 
as a result of their illiquidity  we have recorded a temporary impairment at march  and against the carrying value of our auction rate securities 
credit risk 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments  us treasury bills  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  municipal obligations and student loan backed auction rate securities 
at march  and periodically throughout the year  we have maintained cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits 
we limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution by evaluating the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we invest 

table of contents interest rate risk 
we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates related to our term loan 
as of march   we owed million on this loan with an interest rate of effective march  through april  a sensitivity analysis was performed on the outstanding portion of our debt obligation as of march  should the current weighted average interest rate increase or decrease by  the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense would be approximately thousand as of march  when a sensitivity analysis was performed at march   the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense was thousand 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and indian rupee 
the current exposures arise primarily from expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
netscout currently engages in foreign currency hedging activities in order to limit these exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million 
the valuation of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at march  resulted in a liability balance of thousand  reflecting unfavorable contract rates in comparison to current market rates at this date and an asset balance of thousand reflecting favorable rates in comparison to current market rates
