executive summary through our interest in douglas emmett properties  lp our operating partnership and its subsidiaries  including our investments in unconsolidated funds  we own or partially own  manage  lease  acquire and develop real estate  consisting primarily of office and multifamily properties 
as of december   our consolidated portfolio of properties included class a office properties including ancillary retail space totaling approximately million rentable square feet and multifamily properties containing  apartment units  as well as the fee interests in parcels of land subject to ground leases 
our total office portfolio consisted of office properties with approximately million rentable square feet  which includes our consolidated office properties and the class a office properties owned by the funds we manage  and in which we invested an average of of the total capital 
as of december   our consolidated office portfolio was leased and occupied  our total office portfolio including properties owned by our funds and our operating partnership was leased and occupied  and our multifamily properties were leased and occupied 
at december   the annualized rent of our consolidated portfolio reflected approximately from our office properties and the remaining from our multifamily properties 
our properties are located in premier los angeles county submarkets brentwood  olympic corridor  century city  santa monica  beverly hills  westwood  sherman oaks encino  warner center woodland hills and burbank as well as in honolulu  hawaii 
at december   the annualized rent of our consolidated portfolio reflected approximately from our los angeles county office and multifamily properties and the remaining from our honolulu  hawaii office and multifamily properties 
recent year acquisitions  dispositions  repositionings and financings financings in january  we modified and extended the maturity of our million loan that was scheduled to mature on march  the modified loan has an outstanding balance of million  bears interest at a floating rate equal to one month libor plus basis points and matures on march  in february  we obtained a secured  non recourse million term loan 
this loan has a maturity date of march   including one year extension options 
the loan bears interest at a fixed interest rate of until march  the loan proceeds were primarily used to repay a term loan that was scheduled to mature in in march  we obtained a secured  non recourse million term loan 
this loan has a maturity date of april   with an annual interest rate effectively fixed at until april  the loan proceeds were used in the repayment of a term loan that was scheduled to mature in in july  we obtained additional secured  non recourse term loans totaling million 
the first loan  for million  bears interest at a fixed rate of through its maturity date of august  the second loan  for million  matures august   and has an annual interest rate effectively fixed at until august  the proceeds of these loans were used in the repayment of term loans that were scheduled to mature in during  we sold million shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of million pursuant to a million at the market atm program 
subsequent to year end  in january  we completed our atm program by selling an additional million shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
subsequent to year end  in january  we obtained a secured  non recourse million term loan 
the loan bears interest at a fixed interest rate of through its maturity date of february  monthly interest payments are interest only until february  with principal amortization thereafter based upon a year amortization table 
subsequent to year end  in january and february  we repaid all of our remaining debt maturities from the proceeds of our new million loan and our atm program  as well as cash on hand 
acquisitions in april  one of our funds acquired a class a office building located on rodeo drive in beverly hills for a contract price of million 
we did not make any property acquisitions in our consolidated portfolio during dispositions during  we had no property dispositions 
repositionings we generally select a property for repositioning at the time we purchase it 
we often strategically purchase properties with large vacancies or expected near term lease roll over and use our knowledge of the property and submarket to determine the optimal use and tenant mix 
a repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property 
a repositioning may involve a complete structural renovation of a building to significantly upgrade the character of the property  or it may involve targeted remodeling of common areas and tenant spaces to make the property more attractive to certain identified tenants 
each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property  tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket 
accordingly  the results are varying degrees of depressed rental revenue and occupancy levels for the affected property  which impacts our results and  therefore  comparisons of our performance from period to period 
the repositioning process generally occurs over the course of months or even years 
although usually associated with newly acquired properties  repositioning efforts can also occur at properties we already own  therefore repositioning properties discussed in the context of this paragraph exclude acquisition properties where the plan for improvement is implemented as part of the acquisition 
during  we had no properties that qualify as repositioning properties 
rental rate trends office rental rates the following table sets forth the average effective annual rental rate per leased square foot and the annualized lease transaction costs for leases executed in our total office portfolio during the specified periods twelve months ended december  historical straight line rents average rental rate annualized lease transaction costs because straight line rent takes into account the full economic value of each lease  including accommodations and rent escalations  we believe that it may provide a better comparison than ending cash rents  which include the impact of the annual escalations over the entire term of the terminating lease 
however  care should be taken in any comparison  as the averages can be affected in each period by factors such as buildings  types of space and term involved in the leases executed during the period 
represents the weighted average straight line annualized base rent ie  excludes tenant reimbursements  parking and other revenue per leased square foot for leases entered into within our total office portfolio 
for our triple net burbank and honolulu office properties  annualized rent is calculated by adding expense reimbursements to base rent represents the weighted average leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances under all office leases within our total office portfolio that were entered into during the applicable period  divided by the number of years of the lease 
office rental rates in our markets generally peaked in and early  so that rental rates on new leases since that period have generally been less than the rental rates on the expiring leases for the same space 
during the fourth quarter of  the average straight line rent under new and renewal leases we signed was higher than the average straight line rent under the expiring leases for the same space 
however  net changes in our office rental rates have not had a significant impact on our revenues in recent periods  as the negative effect of rent roll downs  which affect approximately to of our office portfolio each year  have been offset by the positive impact of the annual to rent escalations contained in virtually all of our continuing in place office leases 
over the next four quarters  we expect to see expiring cash rents as set forth in the following table three months ended expiring cash rents march  june  september  december  expiring square feet expiring rent per square foot includes scheduled expirations for our total office portfolio  including our consolidated portfolio of properties as well as properties totaling million square feet owned by our funds 
expiring square footage reflects all existing leases that are scheduled to expire in the respective quarter shown above  excluding the square footage under leases where the existing tenant has renewed the lease prior to december  these numbers i include leases for space where someone other than the existing tenant for example  a subtenant had executed a lease for the space prior to december  but that had not commenced as of that date but ii do not include exercises of early termination options unless exercised prior to december  or defaults occurring after december  all month to month tenants are included in the expiring leases in the first quarter listed 
represents annualized base rent ie  excludes tenant reimbursements  parking and other revenue per leased square foot at expiration 
the amount reflects total cash base rent before abatements 
for our burbank and honolulu office properties  we calculate annualized base rent for triple net leases by adding expense reimbursements to base rent 
expiring rent per square foot on a quarterly basis is impacted by a number of variables  including variations in the submarkets or buildings involved 
multifamily rental rates with respect to our residential properties  our average rent on leases to new tenants during the fourth quarter of was higher than the rent for the same unit at the time it became vacant 
the following table sets forth the average effective annual rental rate per leased unit for leases executed in our residential portfolio during the specified periods twelve months ended december  rental rate results of operations and basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for the three years ended december   and are the consolidated financial statements of douglas emmett  inc and our subsidiaries including our operating partnership 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
the comparability of our results of operations between  and is affected by i the acquisitions of office property we acquired during the second quarter of  property acquired during the fourth quarter of by one of our funds and property acquired during the second quarter of by one of our funds and ii the deconsolidation of one of our funds  which owned properties  at the end of february  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
beginning in february  we have accounted for our interest in our funds under the equity method 
funds from operations many investors use funds from operations  or ffo  as a performance yardstick to compare our operating performance with that of other reits 
ffo represents net income loss  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  other than temporary impairments of investments  real estate depreciation and amortization other than amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  although doing so may still involve some judgments for example  amortization of the impact of swap terminations 
like any metric  ffo is not perfect as a measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations 
other equity reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and  accordingly  our ffo may not be comparable to those other reits ffo 
accordingly  ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance 
ffo should not be used as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends 
ffo should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap 
for the reasons described below  our ffo for increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the following table in thousands sets forth a reconciliation of our ffo to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap year ended december  funds from operations ffo net income loss attributable to common stockholders depreciation and amortization of real estate assets net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests gain on disposition of interest in unconsolidated real estate fund swap termination fee amortization of swap termination fee less adjustments attributable to consolidated joint venture and unconsolidated investment in real estate funds ffo we terminated certain interest rate swaps in november and december by paying an amount based on the projected payments due under the swap 
for ffo purposes  we recognize the full impact of the termination in the quarter in which the swap is terminated 
in contrast  under gaap  we amortize the impact over the remaining life of the swap 
with respect to the swaps terminated in november  gaap net income for the fourth quarter and full year of was reduced by only million  while ffo in both periods was reduced by an additional million to reflect the full impact of terminating those swaps 
as that additional million of non cash interest expense was amortized for gaap purposes during the first months of  we offset that amortization by an equivalent amount in calculating ffo for each period 
as a result  the november swap termination had a net zero impact on ffo 
similarly  with respect to the swaps terminated in december  gaap net income for the fourth quarter and full year of was reduced by only million  while ffo in both periods was reduced by an additional million to reflect the full impact of terminating those swaps 
during the first months of  as that additional million of non cash interest expense is amortized for gaap purposes  we will offset that amortization by an equivalent amount in calculating ffo for each period 
accordingly  there will be a net zero impact from the december swap termination on ffo 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues office rental revenue rental revenue includes rental revenues from our office properties  percentage rent on the retail space contained within our office properties  and lease termination income 
total office rental revenue decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to million lower revenue from the office properties we owned during both comparable periods  partially offset by million of incremental rent from the property we acquired at the end of the second quarter of the decrease for the office properties owned during both periods was primarily due to decreases in occupancy and lower accretion from below market leases in place at the time of our initial public offering ipo as the result of the ongoing expiration of these leases 
office tenant recoveries total office tenant recoveries increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to million in additional revenue from the property we acquired at the end of the second quarter of office parking and other income total office parking and other income increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to million of additional revenue from the property we acquired at the end of the second quarter of  partly offset by a decrease of million for the office properties owned during both periods as a result of lower occupancy 
multifamily revenue total multifamily revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to increases in average rental rates 
operating expenses office rental expenses total office rental expense increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to million of additional expense from the property we acquired at the end of the second quarter of  as well as an increase of million for the remainder of our office portfolio primarily due to increases in utilities expenses  scheduled services and ancillary property tax assessments 
multifamily rental expenses total multifamily rental expense increased by thousand  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to increases in utilities expenses and payroll 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million for the office properties owned during both periods resulting from the completion of the depreciation of certain tenant related assets which were acquired at the time of our ipo in  partially offset by million of incremental depreciation expense from the property we acquired at the end of the second quarter of non operating income and expenses loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate funds this amount represents our equity interest in the operating results from our funds  including the operating income net of historical cost basis depreciation  for the full year 
our share of the loss  including depreciation  from our funds decreased by million or  to million for compared to million for  which was primarily due to better operating results for the funds  as well as an increase in revenue we earned for managing our funds 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates  both as a result of our refinancings and the expiration and termination of certain interest rate swaps 
these decreases were partially offset by increased interest expense related to the amortization of the remaining accumulated other comprehensive income balance associated with certain cash flow swaps that we terminated in this accumulated other comprehensive income balance was fully amortized by the end of the third quarter of in december  we terminated certain swaps for which a portion of the accumulated other comprehensive income balance was amortized to interest expense in the remaining accumulated other comprehensive income balance will be amortized during see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues office rental revenue total office rental revenue decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to million of rent reflected in our consolidated results from the properties owned by the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february  as well as a decrease of million for the remainder of our portfolio  partially offset by million of incremental rent from the property we acquired during the second quarter of the million decrease for the remainder of our portfolio was primarily due to lower accretion of net below market rents and decreases in occupancy and rental rates 
office tenant recoveries total office tenant recoveries increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to million of additional revenue from the property we acquired during and thousand from the remainder of our office portfolio  partially offset by thousand of recoveries in from the properties owned by the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february the increase for the remainder of our portfolio was primarily due to the completion of common area management cam reconciliations during and the corresponding recognition of incremental amounts due 
office parking and other income total office parking and other income increased by thousand  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to million of additional revenue from the property we acquired during  partially offset by million of parking income in from the properties owned by the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february  as well as decreases in parking and other income of million for the remainder of our portfolio as a result of lower occupancy and usage 
operating expenses office rental expenses total office rental expense increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to million of incremental expense from the property we acquired during  partially offset by million in office rental expenses in from the properties owned by the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february office rental expense was essentially unchanged for the remainder of our portfolio 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to the cost of our multi year equity grants that were announced during the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to million in depreciation and amortization in from the properties owned by the fund that was deconsolidated at the end of february and million for the remainder of our portfolio due to certain assets being fully depreciated  partially offset by million of incremental depreciation from the property we acquired during non operating income and expenses gain on disposition of interest in unconsolidated real estate fund in february  we recorded a gain of million related to the properties previously contributed to one of our funds that was deconsolidated in february  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income loss other income loss in reflected a net income of million  which included thousand of net profit generated by our management of the properties owned by our funds as well as thousand of interest income 
other income loss reflected a net loss in which represents the allocation to outside ownership interest of profit generated by the properties we contributed to the fund that were deconsolidated at the end of february  net of the profit generated by our management of those properties during the months of following deconsolidation 
loss  including depreciation  from unconsolidated real estate funds this totaled million for and million for the amount reflects only the months after the fund involved was deconsolidated 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to the expiration of various interest rate swaps during the third and fourth quarters of  which caused billion of our variable rate debt to no longer have corresponding swap payments at a higher fixed rate in exchange for lower variable interest 
additionally  as a result of the natural expiration and early termination of approximately billion of our pre ipo swaps  there was lower non cash interest expense from the amortization of these interest rate swaps 
the decrease was partially offset by the amortization of other comprehensive income resulting from the early termination of our cash flow swaps 
liquidity and capital resources our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions  redevelopment and repositioning of properties  non recurring capital expenditures and repayment of indebtedness at maturity 
we do not expect that we will have sufficient funds on hand to cover all of these long term cash requirements 
the nature of our business  and the requirements imposed by reit rules that we distribute a substantial majority of our income on an annual basis  may cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over the long term  although we have not had any taxable income to date 
with respect to  we declared dividends aggregating per share  at the rate of per share for the first quarter of the year and per each quarter during the remaining three quarters of the year 
we will seek to satisfy our long term liquidity needs through cash flows from operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of debt and equity securities  including units in our operating partnership  property dispositions and joint venture transactions 
we have historically financed our operations  acquisitions and development  through long term secured floating rate mortgage debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in short term interest rates on our cash flows from operations  we generally enter into interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements at the time we enter into term borrowings 
we expect to meet our operating liquidity requirements generally through cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
excluding any acquisitions and debt refinancings  we anticipate that cash on hand and provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
available borrowings  cash balances and capital resources we had total indebtedness of billion at december   excluding a loan premium representing the mark to market adjustment on variable rate debt assumed from our ipo 
we have typically financed our capital needs through short term lines of credit and long term secured mortgages  some of which are fixed and some of which are at floating rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in short term interest rates on our cash flows from operations  we generally enter into interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements with respect to our long term secured mortgages with floating rates 
at december   approximately billion or of our debt had an annual interest rate that was effectively fixed at an average rate of on an actual day basis 
see item a of this report for a description of the impact of variable rates on our interest expense 
see also note and note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
as of december   only one loan with a balance of million was scheduled to mature in on january  we paid down million of the million loan and on february   we paid down the remaining million 
on january   we obtained a secured  non recourse million term loan 
the loan bears interest at a fixed interest rate of through its maturity date of february  monthly interest payments are interest only until february  with principal amortization thereafter based upon a year amortization table 
the loan proceeds were primarily used to pay down a portion of the remaining million of the debt maturities 
at december   our billion of borrowings under secured loans represented of our total market capitalization of billion 
total market capitalization includes our consolidated debt and the value of common stock and operating partnership units  each based on our common stock closing price at december  on the new york stock exchange of per share 
during we sold million shares of our common stock in open market transactions under our atm program for gross proceeds of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of we sold million shares of our common stock under the atm program  in exchange for gross proceeds of approximately million 
after commissions of thousand and other expenses  the net proceeds from the sales during the quarter totaled million 
we did not make any repurchases of shares or share equivalents during we did not sell or repurchase any share equivalents during during  we repurchased  share equivalents in open market transactions and  share equivalents in a private transaction for a total combined consideration of approximately million 
subsequent to year end  we sold an additional million shares of our common stock in open market transactions under our atm program for gross proceeds of approximately million  which completed our million atm program 
we used the proceeds from the atm program and the new million loan  as well as cash on hand  to repay the remaining million of our debt scheduled to mature in as a result of these actions  we reduced our outstanding consolidated debt from billion on december  to billion on february  commitments the following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments  excluding periodic interest payments  as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years thereafter long term debt obligations minimum lease payments remaining capital commitment to unconsolidated real estate funds purchase commitments related to capital expenditures associated with tenant improvements and repositioning and other purchase obligations total for detail of the rates that determine our periodic interest payments related to our long term debt obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
all of the long term debt shown as due in less than one year was fully repaid as of february  because there is not an explicit date for when our remaining capital commitment will be called  we reflect the entire commitment in the earliest category 
off balance sheet arrangements we have established and manage funds through which institutional investors provide capital commitments for acquisition of properties 
the capital we invest in our funds is invested on a pari passu basis with the other investors 
in addition  we also receive certain additional distributions based on committed capital and on any profits that exceed certain specified cash returns to the investors 
we do not expect to receive additional significant liquidity from our investments in our funds until the disposition of the properties held by the relevant fund  which may not be for many years 
certain of our wholly owned affiliates provide property management and other services with respect to the real estate owned by our funds for which we are paid fees and or reimbursed our costs 
at december   our funds had obtained capital commitments of million  of which million remained undrawn 
this amount included commitments from us of million  of which million remained undrawn 
we do not have any debt outstanding in connection with our interest in our funds 
each of our funds may have its own debt  secured by the properties it owns 
the following table summarizes the debt of our funds at december  type of debt principal balance in millions maturity date variable rate fixed rate swap maturity date variable rate term loan swapped to fixed rate libor fixed rate term loan n a n a the loan is secured by properties in a collateralized pool 
requires monthly payments of interest only  with outstanding principal due upon maturity 
we transferred this loan to one of our funds during the fourth quarter of when we contributed the properties securing it to that fund 
we remain responsible under certain environmental and other limited indemnities and guarantees covering customary non recourse carve outs under this loan  which we entered into prior to our contribution of this debt and the related properties  although we have an indemnity from that fund for any amounts we would be required to pay under these agreements 
in addition  if that fund fails to perform any obligations under a swap agreement related to this loan  we remain liable to the swap counterparties 
the maximum future payments under the swap agreements were approximately million as of december  to date  all obligations under the swap agreements have been performed by that fund in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
effective annual rate including the effect of interest rate contracts 
based on actual day basis and excludes amortization of loan fees 
requires monthly payments of principal and interest 
cash flows our cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
our cash flows from operating activities is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio  the rental rates achieved on our leases  the collectability of rent and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating expenses and other general and administrative costs 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash interest paid in the period resulting from lower effective interest rates  both as a result of our refinancings and the expiration and termination of certain interest rate swaps 
this increase was partly offset by an decrease in cash generated from our office rental portfolio in due to lower occupancy rates in the decrease in cash generated from our office rental portfolio in was partly offset by incremental cash flows from the property we acquired at the end of the second quarter of our net cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions  development and redevelopment projects recurring and non recurring capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to i a property acquisition by us in  while the acquisition in the period was made by one of our funds  and ii decreased contributions to our funds in this decrease was partly offset by an increase in capital expenditures in for the property acquired in our net cash related to financing activities is generally impacted by our borrowings  capital activities net of dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests 
net cash flows from financing activities amounted to a net use of cash for totaling million compared to a net provision of cash for totaling million 
the decrease was primarily due to the fact that reflects our debt refinancing program and our atm program that almost entirely offset each other  compared to which reflects additional debt borrowing related to an acquired property 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations of douglas emmett  inc and our predecessor are based upon their respective consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates of certain items and judgments as to certain future events  for example with respect to the allocation of the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings  improvements  equipment  and any related intangible assets and liabilities 
these determinations  even though inherently subjective and subject to change  affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
while we believe that our estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and judgments at the time they are made  some of our assumptions  estimates and judgments will inevitably prove to be incorrect 
as a result  actual outcomes will likely differ from our accruals  and those differences positive or negative could be material 
some of our accruals are subject to adjustment as we believe appropriate based on revised estimates and reconciliation to the actual results when available 
for a discussion of recently issued accounting literature  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report investment in real estate acquisitions of properties and other business combinations are accounted for utilizing the purchase method and  accordingly  the results of operations of acquired properties are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
transaction costs related to acquisitions have been expensed  rather than included with the consideration paid 
estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land  buildings and improvements  equipment and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in place at market leases  acquired above and below market ground leases  and acquired above and below market tenant leases 
initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized no later than months from the acquisition date 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment  and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount 
if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases 
the fair values of tangible assets are determined on an as if vacant basis 
the as if vacant fair value is allocated to land  where applicable  buildings  tenant improvements and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property 
the estimated fair value of acquired in place at market leases are the costs we would have incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition 
such estimates include the fair value of leasing commissions and legal costs that would be incurred to lease the property to this occupancy level 
additionally  we evaluate the time period over which such occupancy level would be achieved and we include an estimate of the net operating costs primarily real estate taxes  insurance and utilities incurred during the lease up period  which is generally months 
above market and below market in place lease values are recorded as an asset or liability based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received or paid pursuant to the in place tenant or ground leases  respectively  and our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed to operations as incurred 
significant improvements are capitalized 
interest  insurance and property tax costs incurred during the period of construction of real estate facilities are capitalized 
when assets are sold or retired  their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period 
the values allocated to land  buildings  site improvements  in place leases and tenant improvements are depreciated on a straight line basis using an estimated life of years for buildings  years for site improvements  the average term of existing leases in the building acquired for in place lease values and the respective remaining lease terms for tenant improvements and leasing costs 
the values of above and below market tenant leases are amortized over the remaining life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market tenant leases or a decrease for above market tenant leases to rental income 
the value of above and below market ground leases are amortized over the remaining life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market ground leases or a decrease for above market ground leases to office rental operating expense 
the amortization of acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations 
if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off 
impairment of long lived assets we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of an investment in real estate or an investment in one of our funds  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property or equity investment 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
income taxes as a reit  we are permitted to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders  eliminating the federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the corporate level 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
revenue recognition four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services are rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all leases are classified as operating leases 
for all lease terms exceeding one year  rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
deferred rent receivables represent rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis in excess of billed rents 
lease termination fees  which are included in rental revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  are recognized when the related lease is canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenant 
estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the expenses are incurred 
subsequent to year end  we perform final reconciliations on a lease by lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments 
in addition  we record a capital asset for leasehold improvements constructed by us that are reimbursed by tenants  with the offsetting side of this accounting entry recorded to deferred revenue which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the deferred revenue is amortized as additional rental revenue over the life of the related lease 
rental revenue from month to month leases or leases with no scheduled rent increases or other adjustments is recognized on a monthly basis when earned 
the recognition of gains on sales of real estate requires that we measure the timing of a sale against various criteria related to the terms of the transaction  as well as any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  profit sharing or leasing method 
if the sales criteria have been met  we further analyze whether profit recognition is appropriate using the full accrual method 
if the criteria to recognize profit using the full accrual method have not been met  we defer the gain and recognize it when the criteria are met or use the installment or cost recovery method as appropriate under the circumstances 
monitoring of rents and other receivables we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent 
we generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants  other than security deposits or letters of credit 
if our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
stock based compensation we have awarded stock based compensation to certain key employees and members of our board of directors in the form of stock options and ltip units 
we estimate the fair value of the awards and recognize this value over the requisite vesting period 
we utilize a black scholes model to calculate the fair value of options  which uses assumptions related to the stock  including volatility and dividend yield  as well as assumptions related to the stock award itself  such as the expected term and estimated forfeiture rate 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions for which we have relied on observations of both historical trends and implied estimates as determined by independent third parties 
for ltip units  the fair value is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant and a discount for post vesting restrictions estimated by a third party consultant 
financial instruments the estimated fair values of financial instruments are determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methods 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
accordingly  estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in current market exchanges 
interest rate agreements we manage our interest rate risk associated with borrowings by obtaining interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts 
no other derivative instruments are used 
we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income  which is a component of our stockholders equity accounts 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
for a description of our interest rate contracts  please see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
at december   million or of our debt was fixed rate debt  billion or of our debt was floating rate debt hedged with derivative instruments that swapped to fixed interest rates  and million or was unhedged floating rate debt 
based on the level of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point change in libor would result in an annual impact to our earnings of approximately million 
subsequent to year end  we repaid a portion of our floating rate debt that was scheduled to mature in therefore at february   million or of our debt was fixed rate debt  billion or of our debt was floating rate debt hedged with derivative instruments that swapped to fixed interest rates  and million or was unhedged floating rate debt 
based on the level of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at february   a basis point change in libor would result in an annual impact to our earnings of approximately thousand 
we calculate interest sensitivity by multiplying the amount of unhedged floating rate debt by the respective change in rate 
the sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration possible changes in the balances or fair value of our floating rate debt 
by using derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk and the potential inability of our counterparties to perform under the terms of the agreements 
we attempt to minimize this credit risk by contracting with high quality bank financial counterparties
