var disclosure of commodity price risk we measure commodity price risk in our energy services segment using a var methodology  which estimates the expected maximum loss of our portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval 
our var calculations are based on the monte carlo approach 
the quantification of commodity price risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance and to determine risk thresholds 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation 
historical data is used to estimate our var with more weight given to recent data  which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements 
other assumptions include a distribution of prices and historical data to calculate volatility and price correlations 
we rely on var to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period 
while management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable  no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating var 
different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
our var exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized due to adverse commodity price movements in our energy services segment s portfolio of derivative financial instruments  physical commodity contracts  leased transport  storage capacity contracts and natural gas in storage 
a one day time horizon and a percent confidence level are used in our var data 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the var calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices  operating exposures and timing thereof  and the changes in our derivative financial instruments  physical contracts and natural gas in storage 
var information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodology s other limitations 
the potential impact on our future earnings  as measured by var  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth the average  high and low var calculations for the periods indicated years ended december  value at risk millions of dollars average high low our var calculation includes derivatives  executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges 
the variations in the var data are reflective of market volatility and changes in our portfolio during the year 
the decrease in average var for  compared with  was due primarily to lower average commodity prices and decreased price volatility in to the extent open commodity positions exist  fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on our business  operating results or financial position 
interest rate risk general we are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and  at times  interest rate swaps 
fixed rate swaps may be used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
floating rate swaps may be used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
at december   the interest rate on all of oneok s and oneok partners long term debt was fixed  and oneok and oneok partners had forward starting interest rate swaps that have been designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of interest payments on a portion of a forecasted debt issuance that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate before the debt is issued 

table of contents counterparty credit risk oneok and oneok partners assess the creditworthiness of their counterparties on an ongoing basis and require security  including prepayments and other forms of collateral  when appropriate
