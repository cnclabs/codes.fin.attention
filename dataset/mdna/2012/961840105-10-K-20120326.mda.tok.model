business segments we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
although the two operating segments have many similarities in their products  production processes  distribution methods  and regulatory environment  there are differences in most of these areas and distinct differences in their economic characteristics 
as a result  we consider these segments to be two distinct reportable segments 
wet seal 
wet seal is a junior apparel brand for girls who seek fashionable clothing at a value  with a target customer age range of to years old 
wet seal seeks to provide its customer base with a balance of trend right and fashion basic apparel and accessories that are affordably priced

our e commerce stores are designed to serve as an extension of the in store experience and offer an expanded selection of merchandise  with the goal of growing both e commerce and in store sales 
we continue to develop our wet seal and arden b websites to increase their effectiveness in marketing our brands 
we do not consider our web based business to be a distinct reportable segment 
the wet seal and arden b reportable segments include  in addition to data from their respective stores  data from their respective e commerce operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for financial information regarding segment reporting  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
our stores wet seal stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of january   we operated wet seal stores 
arden b stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of january   we operated arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed six wet seal stores and opened four and closed one arden b stores 
we currently plan to open approximately to mall based wet seal stores  net of store closings  in fiscal we currently intend to maintain our existing arden b store count in as we focus efforts on improving merchandising and marketing strategies in that business 
we believe future closures for at least the next months following the date of this annual report will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  store leases 
we may  however  accelerate the closure of underperforming stores prior to their lease expirations in cases where we can obtain favorable early lease terminations with the landlords or exercise certain rights contained in the leases 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal we plan to remodel or relocate approximately of these wet seal and arden b stores during fiscal upon lease renewals 
additionally  approximately of these leases expire in the last few days of fiscal  and we expect to remodel or relocate a portion of these stores during fiscal for the remaining expiring leases  we expect to negotiate new leases that will allow us to remain in all but a small number of these locations 

table of contents our ability to increase the number of wet seal and arden b stores in the future will depend  in part  on satisfactory cash flows from existing operations  the demand for our merchandise  and our ability to find suitable mall or other locations with acceptable sites  and satisfactory terms and general business conditions 
our management does not believe there are significant geographic constraints within the us on the locations of future stores

our buyers work closely with senior management to evaluate the 
table of contents optimal merchandise assortments and promotion and pricing strategies 
a significant portion of our merchandise is sourced domestically or from domestic importers 
this sourcing strategy is intended to enable us to ship new merchandise to stores with a high frequency and to react quickly to changing fashion trends 
we also take regular markdowns with the objective of ensuring the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
strong financial position 
in recent years  we have increased our cash  cash equivalents and investments position  extinguished our debt and repurchased a significant number of shares of our class a common stock 
through fiscal  million in principal amount of our convertible notes and million in face amount of our convertible preferred stock had been converted into shares of our class a common stock

we repurchased no common stock during fiscal as of january   our cash  cash equivalents and investments were million  with no debt  and our stockholders equity was million 
strategy as part of a strategic review of business operations  we have identified what we believe are significant opportunities to improve our business trends and drive sales productivity 
we are creatively positioning ourselves for growth in existing store sales productivity and in our store base 
the key elements of our opportunities are to develop a culture of customer obsession 
in fiscal  we began to develop a culture of customer obsession throughout our company  with a goal to make our customer the first and foremost priority in everything we do within our organization 
to better understand our target customers for both our wet seal and arden b brands  in the first half of fiscal we conducted a qualitative and quantitative customer research project  with assistance from an outside research agency 
this project focused on determining our target customers wants and aspirations  her likes and dislikes  why she did or did not shop our stores  what she liked and did not like about us  and competitively where she shopped and why 
through this research  we learned that wet seal is known by its customer for fashion  consistent newness in merchandise and value pricing  while arden b is best known by its customers for fashionable dresses and other social occasion wear 
we also learned of key opportunities for improvement that we believe will allow us to enhance our customers shopping experience and better serve the needs of our target customers  including those that do not currently shop our stores 
we will continue to obtain customer feedback and act upon it to support our customer obsession 
understand and redefine our brands 
through our customer research  we gained an understanding of how our target customers perceive our existing brands and set the groundwork for refining the brand dna for both of our divisions 
we conducted brand definition work in late fiscal through early fiscal  through which we believe that we have developed clear and concise brand positions for both wet seal and arden b 
during fiscal  we intend to articulate these brand positions within our company and improve how we communicate with our wet seal and arden b customers  both in our stores and e commerce  as well as with the broader marketplace 
we believe our refined brand definitions and messaging will support our buying teams in their efforts to present more cohesive merchandise edits in our stores  will provide our store associates with a common voice with which to interact with our customers  and will clarify the point of view of our two business concepts 
continue to manage business conservatively in the near term through the difficult and competitive retail and economic environment 
we have taken many actions intended to increase our financial strength through a difficult economic environment over the near term and to position ourselves to capitalize on our company s growth and operating leverage opportunities when such environment improves 
in anticipation of a continuing difficult retail environment  our near term goals include preserving a strong balance sheet and our existing sales  continuing moderate growth of our wet seal division store base  pursuing capital expenditure investments that are accretive or provide efficiencies to the business and maintaining clean inventory levels  although we cannot assure we will be successful in achieving our goals 
we plan to open to mall based 
table of contents wet seal stores  net of store closings  during fiscal additionally  we intend to continue to identify opportunities to further leverage our planning and allocation  merchandising and inventory management systems  and our distribution center sorter system  and plan to continue to closely monitor inventory positions during fiscal  while seeking to have the appropriate inventory mix and levels to obtain new trend opportunities 
improve merchandise margin 
in our wet seal division  we enacted numerous strategies during fiscal in an effort to improve merchandise margins 
these efforts included consolidation of price points  clarification and reduction of promotional messages  enhanced inventory planning and allocation processes  and modification of markdown cadences 
this led to merchandise margin improvement for the year despite increased commodity cost pressure  primarily from cotton  and a continuing highly promotional competitive environment 
we intend to continue executing these merchandising strategies  as well as optimizing size offerings  further refining the use of our markdown optimization system  improving merchandise sourcing  including leveraging our recently implemented vendor scorecard program that allows us to better measure vendor performance  partner with vendors on plans for continued improvement and to ensure we conduct business with our best vendors  and better exploiting key merchandise categories  as informed by our customer research and brand definition work  in order to build upon our fiscal improvement 
in our arden b division  we intend to maintain our strong dress business while also expanding our sportswear business  in order to build market share and provide a merchandise assortment better aligned with our target customer s wants 
we plan to continue to enhance our promotional planning and strategies  and further improve inventory management  in order to maintain the significant merchandise margin improvement generated in this division in recent years 
we also intend to continue making improvements to our sourcing processes and expand and strengthen our sourcing base  including leveraging our recently implemented vendor scorecard program  as noted above  and to improve our price messaging to gain more recognition from our customers of our value proposition 
improve store operations and develop a selling culture 
we are improving customer service  to support our company customer obsession objectives  through the development of more precise labor scheduling tools to allow our store associates to focus more on our customers  increase store productivity and comparable store sales growth 
we intend to increase store productivity and efficiency through streamlined operational tasks and or eliminated non selling activities and by providing our store associates with the key performance metrics needed to manage and build their business  and perform more detailed analysis and monitoring to identify improvement opportunities for underperforming stores 
in addition  we intend to improve our employee selling skills through stronger partnerships with the merchandising organization in addition to new e learning training and development programs 
moderately grow store base and position for future growth 
we expect fiscal openings of approximately to new wet seal stores  net of store closings  and we expect to maintain the existing arden b store base as we focus efforts on improving merchandising and marketing strategies 
additionally  we plan to remodel or relocate approximately wet seal and arden b stores during fiscal upon lease renewals 
as we open new wet seal stores  or remodel our existing wet seal stores  in fiscal  we intend to continue to utilize a refreshed store design that was developed in fiscal  and to develop a new store design for use in and beyond 
we also intend to continue to utilize an arden b new store prototype developed in as we remodel arden b stores prospectively 
as part of a strategic planning process in fiscal  we intend to develop market by market growth targets  identify target malls within those markets  clarify ideal co tenancies to support location priorities within target malls  and utilize elements of our customer research  brand definitions and new wet seal store design to develop marketing strategies to use with our major mall landlords 
we believe these efforts should position wet seal and arden b for store base growth beyond fiscal improve marketing 
we believe we have an opportunity to improve our marketing strategies and execution 
we intend to make modest incremental marketing investments at both wet seal and arden b and intend to develop and implement specific plans in fiscal that will incorporate the refined brand dna for each division in the second half of the year 
we intend to develop a strategic marketing plan to reach our existing and potential customers and communicate regularly  messaging around our product and our brands 
we also intend to 
table of contents build upon progress made in fiscal with in store marketing  primarily through improved storefront window displays and store interior product images 
we also intend to continue to enhance our e commerce sites as marketing vehicles for our stores  including social networking  and to focus on direct marketing programs and in store visual merchandising 
improve information systems 
since fiscal  we have strategically implemented new or upgraded information systems in several key areas of our business 
these systems include markdown and size optimization  merchandise management  point of sale and distribution center automation 
we will continue work to optimize use of these information systems 
we also intend to focus on improving systems in other areas  including planning  allocation and warehouse management  which are intended to create efficiency and improved merchandising support for our team 
improve physical distribution and transport 
we intend to continue to improve business processes to optimize efficiency of our automated sorter system in our distribution center  which we expect will lead to increased merchandise processing speed and further cost savings 
additionally  we will improve supply chain efficiency through better coordination among and within our vendor base and our internal merchant  planning  distribution and store operations organizations 
realize comparable store sales growth opportunity 
we are focused on regaining sales productivity lost through our comparable stores sales declines experienced in fiscal through  which represented a decline on a cumulative basis  as a result of the challenging economic environment  poor merchandising execution at wet seal  and arden b sales deterioration under its previous merchandising model 
in fiscal and in the first half of fiscal  consolidated comparable store sales began to stabilize  but  in the second half of fiscal  consolidated comparable store sales experienced instability 
in addition  sales productivity at both wet seal and arden b remains below historical peaks 
in fiscal  we will seek to achieve comparable store sales improvement through implementing strategies noted above  which  among other things  include continued focus on building a customer obsessed culture  improved merchandising  planning  promotional and marketing practices  a focus on exploiting key merchandise category opportunities  as informed by our customer research and brand definition work  continued rollout of our modified wet seal store design  and increased efficiencies and decision support from our planning  merchandising and inventory management systems

beginning in fiscal  we significantly reduced the size and cost of the arden b merchandising organization  refined the product development and sourcing processes to include more partnering with merchandise suppliers  and adjusted our merchandise mix and pricing and promotional strategies 
the changes to the pricing and promotional strategies at arden b included significant reductions in price points across all categories 
in response to these changes  arden b began to experience positive comparable store sales results and improved merchandise margins in fiscal  followed by intermittent improvement in fiscal and early fiscal  and then decline in the business in latter fiscal we believe arden b has opportunity 
table of contents to generate more consistent financial growth and performance 
we aim to drive further sales and profitability improvement at arden b by better leveraging our distinctive dress business positioning and value pricing strategy  building our sportswear offering and messaging  and continually improving the in store customer experience 
expand our e commerce business 
under the leadership of our new vp of digital e commerce  hired in february  we plan to resume growth in our e commerce business through several initiatives  including aligning our e commerce and store shopping experiences  employing multi channel marketing strategies  such as synergizing e commerce customer relationship management with our store loyalty programs  expanding e commerce only offerings in certain key merchandise categories  significantly growing our customer contact channels  and improving e commerce inventory planning and allocation practices 
we experienced substantial e commerce sales growth in fiscal  with an increase of in e commerce sales over fiscal beginning in may  we began to more closely align the e commerce shopping experience with our stores  in terms of merchandise assortment and promotional messaging to address what we believed was an increasing divergence in customer bases between our e commerce and store channels 
we believe this led to the loss of certain customers who previously shopped only the e commerce channel and  as a consequence  in fiscal we experienced a decrease of in e commerce sales from fiscal although we made progress stabilizing our e commerce sales within wet seal in late fiscal  we continue to face greater challenges at arden b as we compare against prior year sales that were particularly dependent on an increasing clearance inventory mix 
while this strategy has led to short term declines in our e commerce sales  we believe establishing consistent shopping and brand experiences between the e commerce and store channels is instrumental to driving growth in our multi channel customer base 
we believe this will lead to greater long term growth potential in our e commerce business and to more value from our e commerce channel as a marketing vehicle for our stores 
also  in recent years we have developed industry leading e commerce tools that enhance our website and customer experience 
we added social media features for the website  a cross channel mobile phone application which allows our customers to design  rate  and buy outfits using the majority of wet seal products  website features that allow for selling to countries outside the us we also added additional methods to tender payment 
our e commerce strategy will include rationalization and or improvement of the commercial application of these e commerce tools 
buying our buying teams are responsible for identifying  evolving and editing fashion trends and developing themes to guide our merchandising strategy 
each retail division has a separate buying team 
the merchandising teams for each division develop fashion themes and strategies by identifying trends and assessing how they best apply to our target customer  shopping appropriate domestic and international markets  using fashion services  and gathering references from industry publications 
after selecting fashion themes  the buying teams work closely with vendors to use colors  materials  and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings 
since the fiscal year ended january  fiscal for our wet seal division  and beginning in fiscal for our arden b division  a large percentage of our merchandise is designed externally 
this allows us more flexibility to respond to the changing fashion trends of our target customers  to buy in smaller lots  and to reduce sourcing lead times 
see also allocation and distribution of merchandise below 
marketing  advertising  and promotion we believe that our brands are among our most important assets 
our ability to successfully increase brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brand s target customers 
to that end  we conducted thorough customer market research in fiscal that allowed us to better understand our customers and their needs 
after we completed the customer research  we developed brand dna for each division that will allow us to provide consistent brand messages in our marketing directed to our target customers 
we will also continue our emphasis on visual merchandising in our stores and e commerce  and 
table of contents direct marketing 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we also offer a frequent buyer program in our wet seal stores in order to build loyalty to the brand  increase the frequency of visits  promote multiple item purchases  and gain direct access to the customer 
as part of this program  we send e mails to participants to notify them of special in store promotions 
our arden b division also offers a loyalty program  b rewarded  designed for the same purposes as those of our wet seal division 
we intend to implement marketing strategies to build upon the past successes of these loyalty programs  synergize these programs with our e commerce customer relationship management efforts  and ensure they align with our refined brand dna for each division 
we also plan to more aggressively pursue customer acquisitions and to increase our use of e commerce marketing to drive increased store traffic 
during fiscal   and  we spent   and  respectively  of net sales on advertising 
in fiscal  our primary marketing focus was on visual merchandising  including in store promotion programs and events  and our customer research project 
we expect to increase marketing and advertising spending modestly in fiscal in support of our business strategies 
sourcing and vendor relationships we purchase our merchandise primarily from domestic vendors 
for fiscal  we directly imported approximately of our retail merchandising receipts from foreign vendors 
although in fiscal no single vendor provided more than of our merchandise  management believes we are one of the largest customers of many of our smaller vendors 
quality control is monitored and merchandise is inspected upon arrival at our foothill ranch  california facility 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier  and there are many vendors who could supply our merchandise 
allocation and distribution of merchandise our merchandising strategies depend in part on maintaining a regular flow of fresh  fashionable merchandise into our stores 
successful execution depends largely on our integrated buying  planning  allocation  and distribution functions 
by working closely with store operations management and merchandise buyers  our teams of planners and allocators manage inventory levels and coordinate allocation of merchandise to each of our stores based on sales volume and store size  demographics  climate  and other factors that may influence an individual store s product mix 
we utilize merchandise planning software that assists us in streamlining the planning process 
in fiscal  we implemented size optimization software that we believe has improved our allocation of sizes to better align with each store s needs and we continue to work towards utilizing the software s capacity 
all merchandise is received from vendors at our foothill ranch  california distribution center  where items are inspected and prepared for shipping to our stores 
we ship all of our merchandise to our stores by common carrier 
consistent with our goal of maintaining the freshness of our product offerings  we frequently ship new merchandise to stores  and markdowns are taken regularly to ensure acceptable rates of sale of slow moving inventory 
in fiscal  we implemented a markdown optimization system at our wet seal division to improve the speed of selling through slow product and improve merchandise margins 
marked down merchandise that remains unsold is either sent to select stores for deep discounting and sale  sent to our e commerce store for selling  sold to an outside clearance company  or given to charity 
the fulfillment process and distribution of merchandise for our e commerce business is performed at our foothill ranch  california distribution center 
information and control systems our merchandise  financial  and store computer systems are integrated and operate using primarily oracle technology 
we have invested in a large data warehouse that provides management  buyers  and planners comprehensive data that helps us identify emerging trends and manage inventories 
the core systems supporting our business are frequently enhanced to support strategic business initiatives 

table of contents through an installation completed in fiscal  all of our stores have a point of sale system operating on software provided by oracle 
this system facilitates bar coded ticket scanning  automatic price lookups  and centralized credit authorizations 
all stores are networked to the corporate office via a centrally managed virtual private network 
we utilize a store portal intranet that is integrated with the corporate merchandise erp system to provide the stores and corporate staff with current information regarding sales  promotions  inventory  and shipments  and enables more efficient communications with the corporate office 
we utilize wide area networking hardware at all stores  which guards against security breaches to our stores point of sale system 
we also recently upgraded our merchandising system 
in fiscal  in order to further improve gross margin through the use of technology  we completed implementation of oracle markdown optimization for our wet seal stores  and we completed the implementation of the sas size optimization system 
in  to maximize the benefits of size optimization  we completed installation of a new distribution center automated sorter system to allow automated picking of customized size ranges for each store 
a major upgrade to the oracle retail merchandising system began in fiscal and was completed in early fiscal additionally  several enhancements and upgrades were completed in fiscal to the point of sale systems to create more efficiency within the store environment 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we began to experience cost pressures in the fourth quarter of fiscal and saw further cost increases through fiscal as a result of rising commodity prices  primarily for cotton  increased labor costs  due to labor shortages in china  from which a majority of our merchandise is sourced  and increasing fuel costs 
we expect these sourcing cost pressures to continue in the first quarter of fiscal the rising value of the currency in china relative to the us dollar may also have an impact on future product costs 
in response to the costs increases  we evaluated and opportunistically adjusted our pricing in certain categories  primarily through price consolidation  are leveraging our large vendor base to lower costs and are assessing ongoing promotional strategies in efforts to maintain or improve upon historical merchandise margin levels 
we were able to improve our merchandise margins in fiscal despite rising product costs  and we will continue to diligently monitor our costs as well as the competitive pricing environment in order to mitigate potential margin erosion 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
trademarks we own numerous trademarks  several of which are important to our business 
our primary and most significant trademarks and service marks are wet seal and arden b  which are registered in the united states patent and trademark office

many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls and power centers is intense  and we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
customers our company s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers 
environmental matters we are not aware of any federal  state  or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position  or result in material capital expenditures 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations 
during fiscal  we did not make any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated for fiscal government regulation our company is subject to various federal  state  and local laws affecting our business

our company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices  overtime  and working conditions 
the bulk of our company s employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages 
in the past  we have been assessed penalties or paid settlements to gain dismissal of lawsuits for noncompliance with certain of these laws  and future noncompliance could result in a material adverse effect on our company s operations

in response  we have filed a motion to compel arbitration and  in the alternative  a motion to transfer venue to the county of orange 
on february   the court granted us motion to transfer venue to the county of orange without prejudice to us renewing our motion to compel arbitration 
each of these motions is currently pending 
in april  we were served with a subpoena seeking information related to current and former employees throughout the united states 
in april  an application was filed to enforce the subpoena and we are subject to a nationwide investigation 
we are awaiting the results of the investigation 
we are vigorously defending all outstanding complaints and are unable to predict the likely outcomes and whether such outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
accordingly  no provisions for loss contingencies for such complaints have been accrued as of january  
table of contents we continue to monitor our facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  we could be required to expend funds to modify stores to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
employees as of january   we had  employees  consisting of  full time employees and  part time employees 
full time personnel consisted of salaried employees and  hourly employees 
all part time personnel are hourly employees 
of all employees   were sales personnel and were administrative and distribution center personnel 
personnel at all levels of store operations are provided various opportunities for cash and or other incentives based upon various individual store sales and other performance targets 
all of our employees are nonunion  and  in management s opinion  are paid competitively at current industry standards 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business general economic conditions  perceptions of such conditions by our customers and the impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending have adversely impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so 
our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty 
as a result of the continued difficult economic conditions  we may face risks that will impact many facets of our operations  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations to us 
if poor economic conditions in the us and world economic markets continue  or if they deteriorate further  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may experience declines in comparable store sales in our wet seal division 
although we had a comparable store sales increase in our wet seal division in fiscal  we experienced a decline in comparable store sales in our wet seal division in the fourth quarter of fiscal and no increase and a decline in comparable store sales in that division in fiscal and  respectively 
we cannot assure that we will improve our comparable store sales in the future 
in order to improve comparable store sales results  we will need to focus on a variety of factors  including fashion trends  our merchandise mix  our merchandise planning and allocation practices  holiday periods  actions of competitors  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
there can be no guarantee that financial results of our wet seal division will improve and if they do  there can be no guarantee as to the timing  duration or significance of the improvement 
in the past  we have experienced poor comparable store sales and operating results in our arden b division  and we cannot assure that we will be able to re establish and sustain improvements in the future 
in fiscal and  we experienced poor financial performance in our arden b division 
in fiscal and  comparable store sales and operating results of our arden b division improved as a result of the closing or rebranding of underperforming stores  and changes to promotional and pricing strategies 
however  in fiscal  we experienced weaker comparable same store sales and operating results in the division due to not having the appropriate inventory levels in key performing categories and fashion content weakness 
as a result  there can be no guarantee that our efforts to improve results will be successful and that the financial performance of our arden b division will improve 

table of contents our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management 
in general  our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management  particularly personnel engaged in merchandising and store operations  and on our ability to identify  hire and retain additional key management personnel 
we have had significant changes in management during fiscal and fiscal  and these changes may impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
effective january   we appointed ms 
susan mcgalla as our new chief executive officer  effective march   we appointed mr 
ken seipel as our new president and chief operating officer  effective november   we appointed ms 
barbara cook as our new senior vice president of store operations  and november   we appointed ms 
harriet sustarsic as our new executive vice president and chief merchandise officer for our wet seal division 
while ms 
mcgalla  mr 
seipel  ms 
cook and ms 
sustarsic immediately became involved in the day to day activities of our company  we expect that we will continue to experience a transition period until they are fully integrated organizationally 
we cannot provide any assurance that there will not be any disruption that adversely impacts our customer relationships  employee morale and or our business during such transition period 
furthermore  our senior management may not effectively implement our refined brand dna positions which could have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
ms 
mcgalla  mr 
seipel  ms 
cook and ms 
sustarsic may also implement other new strategic initiatives for our company that have not yet been formulated and we cannot predict how these initiatives will impact us 
if they are ineffective  this would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our company s ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located 
substantially all of our stores are located in regional mall shopping centers 
factors beyond our control impact mall traffic  such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels 
consumer spending and mall traffic remain depressed due to the continued difficult economic conditions 
as a result  mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties 
the increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of certain malls as shopping destinations  have reduced and may continue to reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our ability to procure merchandise could be adversely affected by changes in our vendors factoring arrangements 
changes in our vendors factoring arrangements may threaten the factors financial viability and ability to provide factoring services to its customers 
although we do not have a direct relationship with factors  a portion of our vendors who supply our company with merchandise have direct factoring arrangements 
vendors who engage in factoring transactions will typically sell their accounts receivable to a factor at a discount in exchange for cash payments  which can be used to finance the business and operations of the vendors 
if the financial condition of our vendors factors were to deteriorate and certain of our vendors were unable to procure alternative factoring arrangements from competitors of their factor on the same or substantially similar terms  our ability to timely procure merchandise for our stores could be adversely affected 
this could require the devotion of significant time and attention by our management to adequately resolve such matters 
in turn  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal or state income tax purposes is subject to limitation 
we believe that our net operating losses nols are a valuable asset and we intend to take actions to protect the value of our nols 
however  section of the internal revenue code section contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal net operating loss carryforwards to be used to offset taxable 
table of contents income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in our stockholders ownership interests in our company 
under section  potential limitations on nols are triggered when there has been an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in our stock ownership over a three year period 
we incurred ownership changes in april and december  which resulted in section limitations applying to nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
as a result of these ownership changes  of our million nols as of january   we may utilize up to million to offset taxable income in fiscal and future transactions involving the sale or other transfer of our stock may result in additional ownership changes for purposes of section the occurrence of such additional ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our remaining nols and possibly other tax attributes 
the section limitation is currently under examination by the internal revenue service 
pending the examination results  the nol utilization could be further limited 
limitations imposed on our ability to use nols and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay us federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect 
any further ownership change also could cause such nols and other tax attributes to expire unused  thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flows 
in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to nol utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize nols in some states altogether  which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes 
during fiscal  the state of california passed legislation that suspended our ability to utilize nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and in late  the state of california extended such legislation  which further suspended use of nols to fiscal as a result  we incurred additional state income taxes in california  which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal through in fiscal we generated income  and we expect to generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  resulting in alternative minimum taxes payable on a portion of such income 
in the event that state law results in lower limits  or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards  or we become subject to federal alternative minimum tax  this could adversely affect our future cash flows 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 
furthermore  the continued difficult economic conditions make it increasingly difficult for us to accurately predict product demand trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion and product demand trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image and higher markdowns 
these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any products we sell 
each of our wet seal and arden b divisions has in the past needed to  and may in the future need to  recall products that we determine may present safety issues 
if products we sell have safety problems of which we are not aware  or if we or the consumer product safety commission recall a product sold in our stores  we may suffer negative publicity and  potentially  product liability lawsuits  which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation  financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 
if we decrease the price that we charge for our products or offer extensive  continued promotions on our products  we may earn lower gross margins and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
the prices that we are able to charge for our products depend on  among other things  the type of product offered  the consumer response to the product and the prices charged by our competitors 
to the extent that we are forced to lower our prices  our gross margins will be lower and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

table of contents if we are unable to pass through increases in raw material  labor and energy costs to our customers through price increases  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our product costs rise from time to time due to increasing commodity prices  primarily for cotton  as well as due to higher production labor and energy costs 
we may not be able to  or may elect not to  pass these increases on to our customers through price increases  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon a single center for our corporate offices and distribution activities  and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our corporate offices and the distribution functions for all of our stores and e commerce business are handled from a single  leased facility in foothill ranch  california 
in general  this area of california is subject to earthquakes and wildfires 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  arson  accident  system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating satellite facilities might have on our business  personnel and results of operations 
the financial losses incurred may exceed our insurance for earthquake damages and business interruption costs related to any such disruption 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our revenues for the third fiscal quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues  with a disproportionate amount of our revenues being generated in the third fiscal quarter back to school season  which begins the last week of july and ends during september  and the fourth fiscal quarter holiday season 
our revenues are generally lower during the first half of the fiscal year 
in addition  any factors that harm our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
in order to prepare for our peak shopping seasons  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year 
an unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross profit 
alternatively  an unanticipated increase in demand for certain of our products could leave us unable to fulfill customer demand and result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns 
as a result  historical period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period to period results 
reliance should not be placed on the results of a single fiscal quarter  particularly the third fiscal quarter back to school season or fourth fiscal quarter holiday season  as an indication of our annual results or our future performance 
our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including abercrombie fitch  aeropostale  american eagle  anthropologie  banana republic  bcbg  bebe  body central  charlotte russe  express  
table of contents forever  gap  guess  h m  macy s  nordstrom  old navy  pacific sunwear  rue  target  urban outfitters  zara  and other regional retailers 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowly defined market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms  sourcing merchandise efficiently  pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value  offering attractive promotional incentives while maintaining profit margins  and withstanding periodic downturns in the apparel industry 
our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we expect to open between and mall based wet seal stores  net of store closures  in fiscal at this time  we currently plan to maintain our arden b store base in fiscal as we focus our efforts on improving merchandising and marketing strategies 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls  in particular  and within other locations is intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  actions of our competitors  particularly increased promotional activity  can negatively impact our business 
in light of the continued difficult economic conditions  pricing is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition  particularly through our promotional programs 
to the extent that our competitors lower prices  through increased promotional activity or otherwise  our ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance that our competitors increased promotional activity will not negatively impact our business 
the upcoming expiration of leases for approximately of our existing stores could lead to increased costs associated with renegotiating our leases and or relocating our stores 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal in connection with the expiration of these leases  we will have to renegotiate new leases  which could result in higher rental amounts for each store 
we may not be able to obtain new lease terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  as a result of renewal negotiations  we may be required by the landlord to remodel as a condition for renewal  which could result in significant capital expenditures 
in addition  some landlords may refuse to renew our leases due to our lower sales per square foot as compared with other prospective tenants 
if we are unable to agree to new terms with our landlords  we will have to close or relocate these stores  which could result in a significant expenditure and could lead to an interruption in the operation of our business at the affected stores  and we could be required to relocate to less desirable locations or may not be able to find viable locations at all 

table of contents our computer hardware and software systems are vital to the efficient operation of our retail and web based stores  and damage to these systems could harm our business 
we rely on our computer hardware and software systems for the efficient operation of our retail and web based stores 
our information systems provide our management with real time inventory  sales and cost information that is essential to the operation of our business 
due to our number of stores  geographic diversity and other factors  we would be unable to generate this information in a timely and accurate manner in the event our hardware or software systems were unavailable 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of factors  including earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters and power loss  computer systems failure  or security breaches  internet and telecommunications or data network failure 
a significant information systems failure could reduce the quality or quantity of operating data available to our management 
if this information were unavailable for any extended period of time  our management would be unable to efficiently run our business  which would result in a reduction in our net sales 
a cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
a cyberattack may bypass the security for our information systems  causing an information system security breach and leading to a material disruption of our information systems  the loss of business information and or the loss of e commerce sales 
such a cyberattack could result in any of the following theft  destruction  loss  misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property  operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our information systems and subsequent clean up and mitigation activities  negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers  partners or industry peers  and loss of sales generated through our internet websites through which we sell merchandise to customers to the extent these websites are affected by a cyberattack 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
government regulation of the internet and e commerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 
we are subject to general business regulations and laws  as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e commerce 
existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of our internet or e commerce services

it is not clear how certain existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce 
unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our costs of doing business 
if we fail to comply with payment card industry data security standards  we may be subject to fines or penalties  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are highly dependent on the use of credit cards to complete sale transactions in our stores and through our websites

these laws and the judicial interpretation of such laws are constantly evolving 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we may be subject to fines or penalties  which could impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the importance of our brand names  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b which are registered in the retail store services and other classes 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  others may infringe on our intellectual property rights or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
covenants contained in agreements governing our senior credit facility restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  under certain circumstances  and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior revolving credit facility contains covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business under certain circumstances 
subject to certain exceptions  these covenants restrict or limit our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  repurchase stock  grant liens on assets  pay dividends  and close stores 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the line of credit 
we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert that their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution 
we generally rely upon each vendor s representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 

table of contents we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors and non us vendors that purchase products internationally  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
the majority of our products are manufactured outside the us and are primarily bought by us within the us from domestic importers 
as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes or quotas imposed by the us government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds between the us and foreign jurisdictions and or potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at us ports  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
the us and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
our company s policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the violation of laws  particularly labor laws  by an independent manufacturer  or by one of the sourcing agents  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s or sourcing agent s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located  and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices  could cause significant damage to our company s reputation

table of contents contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock and the application of anti takeover provisions of delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making the acquisition of a substantial block of class a common stock more difficult and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our class a common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview we are a national specialty retailer operating stores selling fashionable and contemporary apparel and accessory items designed for female customers aged to years old 
we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
at january   we had retail stores in states and puerto rico 
of the stores  there were wet seal stores and arden b stores 
we report our results of operations as two reportable segments representing our two retail divisions wet seal and arden b 
e commerce operations for wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
although the two operating segments have many similarities in their products  production processes  distribution methods and regulatory environments  there are differences in most of these areas and distinct differences in their economic characteristics 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to the end of january 
fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal each include weeks of operations 
we consider the following to be key performance indicators in evaluating our performance comparable store sales for purposes of measuring comparable store sales  sales include merchandise sales as well as membership fee revenues recognized under our wet seal division s frequent buyer program during the applicable period 
stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or significant remodel relocation  which we define to be a square footage increase or decrease of at least 
stores that are remodeled or relocated with a resulting square footage change of less than are maintained in the comparable store base with no interruption 
however  stores that are closed for four or more days in a fiscal month  due to remodel  relocation or other reasons  are removed from the comparable store base for that fiscal month as well as for the comparable fiscal month in the following fiscal year 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage on expenses such as store payroll  occupancy  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that are at least partially fixed 
positive comparable store sales results generate greater operating leverage on expenses while negative comparable store sales results negatively affect operating leverage 
comparable store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
average transaction counts we consider the trend in the average number of sales transactions occurring in our stores to be a key performance metric 
to the extent we are able to increase transaction counts in our stores that more than offset the decrease  if any  in the average dollar sale per transaction  we will generate increases in our comparable store sales 

table of contents gross margins we analyze the components of gross margin  specifically cumulative mark on  markups  markdowns  shrink  buying costs  distribution costs and store occupancy costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups  a significant increase in our use of markdowns or in inventory shrink  or an inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on other components of cost of sales could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
operating income we view operating income as a key indicator of our financial success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross margins and the changes we experience in operating costs 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others 
these include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition  short term investments  merchandise inventories  long lived assets  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes and insurance reserves 
revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchases by customers at our retail store locations 
taxes collected from our customers are recorded on a net basis 
for e commerce sales  revenue is recognized at the estimated time goods are received by customers 
e commerce customers typically receive goods within four days of being shipped 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers for e commerce sales are included in net sales 
for fiscal  and  shipping and handling fee revenues were million  million and million  respectively  within net sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded accruals to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
our sales return policy allows customers to return merchandise within days of original purchase 
wet seal retail store merchandise may be returned for store credit only and arden b retail store merchandise may be returned for cash refund or store credit within seven days of the original purchase date  and for store credit only thereafter 
for wet seal and arden b e commerce sales  merchandise may be returned within days for a full refund 
actual return rates have historically been within management s estimates and the accruals established 
as the accrual for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the accrual  which could impact net sales 
the accrual for merchandise returns is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 

table of contents we recognize the sales from gift cards  gift certificates and store credits as they are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to redemption  we maintain an unearned revenue liability for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits until we are released from such liability 
our gift cards  gift certificates and store credits do not have expiration dates  however  over time  a percentage of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits are not redeemed or recovered breakage 
based upon historical redemption trend data  we previously determined that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and store credits three years after their issuance is remote and adjusted our unearned revenue liability quarterly to record breakage as additional sales for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits that remained unredeemed three years after their issuance 
based upon an analysis completed by us during the second fiscal quarter of  historical redemption patterns indicated that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and store credits greater than two years after their issuance is remote 
as a result  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our unearned revenue liability to recognize the change in estimated timing of when breakage of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits is recognized from greater than three years after their issuance dates to greater than two years after their issuance dates 
our net sales in the second quarter of fiscal included a benefit of million due to this change in estimate to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
our net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal included a benefit of million  million and million  respectively  to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
the unearned revenue for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from the assumptions underlying our breakage adjustments  or our future experience indicates the likelihood of redemption of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits becomes remote at a different point in time after issuance  we may recognize further significant adjustments to our accruals for such unearned revenue  which could have a significant effect on our net sales and results of operations 
we maintain a frequent buyer program  the fashion insider card  through our wet seal division 
under the program  customers receive a to discount on all purchases made during a month period and are provided off coupons that may be used on purchases during such period 
the annual membership fee of is nonrefundable 
discounts received by customers on purchases using the frequent buyer program are recognized at the time of such purchases 
we recognize membership fee revenue under the frequent buyer program on a straight line basis over the month membership period 
from time to time  we test alternative program structures  and promotions tied to the program  and may decide to further modify the program in ways that could affect customer usage patterns 
as a result of this program testing and potential further modifications  we believe it is appropriate to maintain straight line recognition of membership fee revenue 
we may  in the future  determine that recognition of membership fee revenue on a different basis is appropriate  which would affect net sales 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
we maintain a customer loyalty program through our arden b division 
under the program  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may be redeemed for merchandise 
unredeemed awards and accumulated partial points are accrued as unearned revenue and awards redeemed by the member for merchandise are recorded as an increase to net sales 
we convert into fractional awards the points accumulated by customers who have not made purchases within the preceding months 
similar to all other awards currently being granted under the program  such fractional awards expire if unredeemed after days 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from accrued redemption levels  or if we further modify the terms of the program in a way that affects expected redemption value and levels  we could record adjustments to the unearned revenue accrual  which would affect net sales 

table of contents short term investments our short term investments consisted of interest bearing corporate bonds that were guaranteed by the us government under the temporary liquidity guarantee program  had maturities that were less than one year and were carried at amortized cost plus accrued income 
short term investments were carried at amortized cost due to our intent to hold to maturity 
short term investments on the consolidated balance sheets were million at january  during fiscal  our short term investments matured and we recovered the entire amortized cost basis of the securities 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is stated at its current retail selling value and then is converted to a cost basis by applying a cost to retail ratio based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
markdowns are recorded when the sales value of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
total markdowns  including permanent and promotional markdowns  on a cost basis in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
we accrued million and million for planned but unexecuted markdowns  including markdowns related to slow moving merchandise  as of january   and january   respectively 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important that could result in the necessity to perform an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that indicates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the realization of a long lived asset or asset group 
other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
this evaluation is performed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related assets 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets  based on discounted cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital 
we have considered all relevant valuation techniques that could be obtained without undue cost and effort and have determined that the discounted cash flow approach continues to provide the most relevant and reliable means by which to determine fair value in this circumstance 
quarterly  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during fiscal  and  we determined such 
table of contents events or changes in circumstances had occurred with respect to certain of our retail stores  and that operating losses or insufficient operating income would likely continue 
as such  we recorded noncash charges of million  million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and to write down the carrying value of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair values 
the estimation of future cash flows from operating activities requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance 
if our sales growth  gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level  or inflation exceeds our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our retail stores may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted to employees 
we use these values to recognize stock compensation expense for stock options 
the black scholes model is complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate future common stock dividend yield  common stock expected volatility and the expected life of the stock options 
these assumptions significantly affect our stock option valuations  and future changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations of future stock option grants and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined stock option values were better represented by an alternative valuation method  such change could also significantly affect future stock compensation expense 
we also apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value performance shares granted to employees 
use of the black scholes model for this purpose requires the same exercise of judgment noted above 
the monte carlo simulation model is also complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate expected returns on our common stock  expected common stock volatility and our maximum expected share value during applicable vesting periods 
we currently believe monte carlo simulation provides the most relevant value of performance share grants as the simulation allows for vesting throughout the vesting period and includes an assumption for equity returns over time  while the black scholes method does not 
as the monte carlo simulation provides a more precise estimate of fair value  we have used that approach to value our performance shares for accounting purposes 
the assumptions we use to value our performance shares significantly affect the resulting values used for accounting purposes 
accordingly  changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined performance share values were better represented by the black scholes model or an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of performance shares  such changes could also significantly affect future stock compensation 
the following table summarizes stock based compensation recorded in the consolidated statements of operations fiscal year ended january  january  january  in thousands cost of sales selling  general  and administrative expenses stock based compensation 
table of contents accounting for income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as various state jurisdictions within the united states 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and nols 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized using all available positive and negative evidence  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider  among other things  three years of cumulative operating income 
in  as a result of historical operating losses and projected future results  we fully reserved against our deferred tax assets 
as of fiscal  we performed an analysis of all available evidence including  but not limited to  generating taxable income for the past four consecutive years  including in which we operated in an extremely challenging retail and economic environment  and concluded that the evidence supported that it is more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets will be realized  and we reversed the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in the amount of million  which was recorded to benefit provision for income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we evaluate our charitable contributions carryforward for likelihood of realizability prior to expiration and provided a reserve against any amounts that are deemed more likely than not to be realized 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented a change in tax method  upon filing our federal income tax return  which resulted in the reduction of deferred tax assets related to our charitable contribution carry forwards of million 
this decrease was recorded as a deferred income tax charge and increased our effective income tax rate for the quarter 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was approximately 
due to our utilization of federal and state nols during fiscal  we incurred cash income taxes for the fiscal year of approximately of pre tax income  representing the portion of federal and state alternative minimum taxes and state of california and various other state regular income taxes that cannot be offset by nols 
the difference between the effective income tax rate and the cash income taxes is recorded as a non cash provision for deferred incomes taxes 
we believe that our nols are a valuable asset and we intend to protect the value of our nols 
however  section of the internal revenue code section contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal nols to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests of our common stock 
under section  an ownership change that triggers potential limitations on nols occurs when there has been a greater than change in ownership interest by shareholders owning or more of a company over a period of three years or less 
based on our analysis  we had ownership changes in april and december  which resulted in section limitations applying to federal nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
as a result of those ownership changes  of our million of remaining federal nols  we may utilize up to million of our federal nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and the section limitation is currently under examination by the internal revenue service 
pending the examination results  the nol utilization could be further limited 
we may also experience additional ownership changes in the future  which could further limit the amount of federal nols annually available 
as of january   there have been no ownership changes since 
table of contents in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to nol utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize nols in some states altogether  which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes 
during fiscal  the state of california passed legislation that suspended our ability to utilize nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and in late  the state of california extended such legislation that further suspended use of nols to fiscal and as a result  we incurred additional state income taxes in california  which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal through the company may also generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable on a portion of such income 
the calculation of our tax assets involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 
at january   we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits or expenses that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we are currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments  accruals or material deviations from our recognized tax positions 
however  if we later identify other income tax issues that result in significant additional payments or necessary accruals  this could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 
insurance reserves we are partially self insured for our workers compensation and employee group health plans 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we are liable for a deductible of million for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability of million 
under our employee group health plan  we are liable for a deductible of million for each claim and an aggregate monthly liability of million 
the monthly aggregate liability is subject to adjustment based on the number of participants in the plan each month 
for both of the insurance plans  we record a liability for the costs associated with reported claims and a projected estimate for unreported claims considering historical experience and industry standards 
we will continue to adjust the estimates as actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause us to revise our estimate of potential losses and affect our reported results 
included in accrued liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets as of january   and january   are million and million  respectively  for reported claims and estimated unreported claims under our self insured workers compensation and employee group health plans 
current trends and outlook the overall retail environment continues to be volatile  driven by several factors  including uncertainty regarding the global economy  the lack of significant improvement in the us housing market and unemployment rates across all regions of the us in addition  us gross domestic product growth has been inconsistent and at a slow pace  further leading to a volatile  and generally weak  retail environment 
as a result  in fiscal we experienced a very aggressive promotional environment  with consumer spending heavily focused on promotion and clearance buying  which contributed to a slowdown in our rate of merchandise margin improvement and a decline in our comparable store sales in the second half of the fiscal year 
in addition  we began to experience increased sourcing costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal and saw further cost increases through fiscal as a result of rising commodity prices  primarily for cotton  increased labor costs due to labor shortages in china  from which a majority of our merchandise is sourced  and increased fuel costs 
we expect many of these sourcing cost pressures to continue into fiscal the rising value of the currency in china relative to the us dollar may also have a further impact on future product costs 
our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty 
as a result of the continued difficult economic conditions  we may face risks that will impact many facets of our operations  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations to us 
although we believe we are sufficiently prepared 
table of contents and financially strong enough to endure poor economic conditions in the us and world economic markets  if such conditions continue  or if they deteriorate further  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our comparable store sales increased during fiscal  driven by a comparable store sales increase in our wet seal division  partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease in our arden b division 
the wet seal division s comparable store sales increase was primarily driven by an increase in average dollar sales per transaction  partially offset by a decrease in transaction volume  driven by an increase in units purchased per customer  partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price 
at wet seal  after positive momentum continued in our business through the back to school shopping period through august and into early september  business became more challenging as we transitioned to fall  as our merchandise assortment for the season did not perform to our expectations 
as we entered the holiday season  we executed upon our plan for less aggressive promotions than fiscal and  as planned  experienced improved merchandise margins  but with a decline in comparable store sales 
the arden b division comparable store sales decrease was primarily driven by a decline in transaction volume and units purchased per customer  partially offset by an increase in its average dollar sales per transaction  driven by an increase in average unit selling price 
at arden b  throughout fiscal our dress and jewelry businesses were strong  but performance was below our expectations in other apparel and accessory categories 
our combined e commerce sales declined during fiscal  from the prior year  as we began an initiative to reduce promotional levels and rebalance inventories more toward regular price versus clearance items in the e commerce channel in an effort to better align the e commerce presentation and shopping experience with those of the stores 
for the four weeks ended february   our consolidated comparable store sales decreased and we have provided guidance for the first quarter fiscal at a mid to high single digit comparable store sales decline 
we made progress on several key initiatives during fiscal we continued to drive merchandise margin improvement versus the prior year in the wet seal division  despite increasing merchandise costs and the promotional competitive environment in fiscal  by effectively planning and managing the level and depth of promotional markdowns 
we also remained focused on providing clearer promotional messaging in the stores 
our top near term strategic priority is to improve our business trends and drive sales productivity improvement in our stores 
to support sales productivity growth  we have established specific initiatives  including developing a culture of customer obsession  implementing merchandising improvements as informed by independent customer research we conducted during fiscal  redefining our brand dna for both divisions  modifying our wet seal store design to support our brands and enhance our customers shopping experience and focusing on increasing store personnel productivity through streamlined operational tasks and or eliminated non selling activities and introducing training programs focused on developing a selling culture 
higher store productivity would promote comparable store sales growth 
other strategic priorities include continuing to improve upon wet seal merchandise margins  improving the arden b business to allow it to stabilize and reach its full potential  and expanding our existing retail store base and e commerce businesses 
we are also focused on improving gross margins by optimizing sourcing of merchandise  enhancing our inventory planning and allocation functions and improving supply chain efficiency through better coordination among and within our vendor base  internal distribution and store operation organizations 
although we have embarked on the strategic initiatives and priorities above  there is much work ahead of us to ensure the successful implementation of our strategy and to realize significant benefits to the business 
store openings and closures during fiscal  we opened and closed six wet seal stores and opened four and closed one arden b stores

we currently plan to open to wet seal stores in fiscal  net of store closings  with a focus on malls 
we currently intend to maintain existing store count in arden b as we focus efforts on improving merchandising and marketing strategies

capital expenditures that remain unpaid as of january   have decreased million since the end of fiscal we expect to pay nearly all of the total balance of such amounts payable of million during the first quarter of fiscal we estimate that  in fiscal  capital expenditures will be between million and million  of which approximately million to million is expected to be for the remodeling and or relocation of existing wet seal and arden b stores upon lease renewals and the construction of new wet seal and arden b stores 
we anticipate receiving approximately million in tenant improvement allowances from landlords  resulting in net capital expenditures of between million and million 
for fiscal  net cash used by financing activities was million  comprised primarily of million used to repurchase  shares of our class a common stock  completing the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors and less than million of deferred financing costs  slightly offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options

as an inducement for the holder to undertake these conversions and or exercises of the notes  preferred stock and series e warrants  we provided the holder with a million inducement fee 
we also repurchased an insignificant remaining note balance from another holder 
as a result of these transactions  there are no longer any remaining notes and preferred stock outstanding and there was a satisfaction and discharge of our obligations under the indenture governing the notes 
on november   all of the company s remaining series e warrants expired unexercised 
as a result  no warrants to acquire the company s class a common stock remain outstanding 

table of contents total cash  cash equivalents and investments at january   was million compared to million at january  on february   we renewed  via amendment and restatement  our million senior revolving credit facility with our existing lender the facility  which can be increased up to million in the absence of any default and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the facility 
the facility expires in february under the facility  we are subject to borrowing base limitations on the amount that can be borrowed and certain customary covenants  including  under certain circumstances  covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments and acquisitions  grant liens  pay dividends  repurchase our common stock  close stores and dispose of assets  without the lender s consent 
our ability to borrow and request the issuance of letters of credit is subject to the requirement that we maintain an excess of the borrowing base over the outstanding credit extensions of the greater of of the aggregate amount of the facility or million 
the annual interest rate on the revolving line of credit under the facility is i the higher of the lender s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus or the one month london interbank offered rate libor plus  collectively referred to as the base rate  plus the applicable margin ranging from to or  ii if we elect  either the one  two  three or six months libor plus a margin ranging from to 
the applicable base rate or libor margin is based on the level of average excess availability  as defined under the facility  at the time of election  as adjusted quarterly 
we also incur fees on outstanding letters of credit under the facility at an annual rate equal to the applicable libor margin for standby letters of credit and of the applicable libor margin for commercial letters of credit 
additionally  we are subject to commitment fees at an annual rate of on the unused portion of the line of credit under the facility 
borrowings under the facility are secured by cash  cash equivalents  investments  receivables and inventory held by us and our wholly owned subsidiaries  the wet seal retail  inc and wet seal catalog  inc  each of which may be a borrower under the facility 
at january   the amount outstanding under the facility consisted of million in open documentary letters of credit related to merchandise purchases and million in outstanding standby letters of credit 
at january   we had million available for cash advances and or for the issuance of additional letters of credit  and we were in compliance with all covenant requirements under the facility 
we believe we will have sufficient cash and credit availability to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
the financial performance of our business is susceptible to declines in discretionary consumer spending  availability of consumer credit and low consumer confidence in the united states 
increasing fuel prices and commodity costs may also cause a shift in consumer demand away from the retail clothing products that we offer 
there are no guarantees that government or other initiatives will limit the duration or severity of the current economic challenges or stabilize factors that affect our sales and profitability 
continuing adverse economic trends could affect us more significantly than companies in other industries 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we began to experience cost pressures in the fourth quarter of fiscal and saw further cost increases through fiscal as a result of rising commodity prices  primarily for cotton  increased labor costs  due to labor shortages in china  from which a majority of our merchandise is sourced  and increasing fuel costs 

table of contents we expect many of these sourcing cost pressures to continue into fiscal the rising value of the currency in china relative to the us dollar may also have an impact on future product costs 
in response to the cost increases  we have evaluated and opportunistically adjusted our pricing in certain categories  are leveraging our large vendor base to lower costs and are assessing ongoing promotional strategies in efforts to maintain or improve upon historical merchandise margin levels 
we have been able to improve our merchandise margins to date despite rising product costs  and we will continue to diligently monitor our costs as well as the competitive pricing environment in order to mitigate potential margin erosion 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
commitments and contingencies our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments at january   are summarized in the following charts 
we have no other off balance sheet commitments 
contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years over years lease commitments operating leases fixed common area maintenance supplemental employee retirement plan merchandise on order with suppliers total lease commitments include operating leases for our retail stores  principal executive offices  warehouse facilities  vehicles  computers and office equipment under operating lease agreements expiring at various times through certain leases for our retail stores include fixed common area maintenance obligations

we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier 
we have markdown risk to the extent we do not ultimately achieve adequate sell through on such merchandise 
our other commercial commitments consist of letters of credit primarily for the procurement of domestic and imported merchandise and to secure obligations to certain insurance providers  and are secured through our senior revolving credit facility 
at january   our contractual commercial commitments under these letter of credit arrangements were as follows other commercial commitments in thousands total amounts committed amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years over years letters of credit other off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements  except for operating lease and purchase obligations as discussed above 

table of contents recently adopted accounting pronouncements and new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued guidance and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the levels within the fair value hierarchy 
separate disclosures are required for transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  and the reasons for the transfers must be disclosed 
in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements  separate disclosures are required for purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  effective january   we adopted the new and updated guidance for disclosures  aside from that deferred to periods after december   and this did not significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
we adopted the remaining guidance on disclosures effective january   and this did not significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance on the application of fair value accounting where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
amendments include those that clarify the fasb s intent regarding the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements  and change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
for many of the requirements  the fasb does not intend for the amendments to result in a change in the application of the requirements 
this guidance is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments provide an entity with an option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both options  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december   and should be applied on a retrospective basis 
we have not yet selected which presentation option we will apply 
the adoption of this guidance will affect the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
additional information regarding new accounting pronouncements is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk to the extent that we borrow under the facility  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at january   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
at january   the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facility was 
based upon a sensitivity analysis as of january   if we had average outstanding borrowings of million during fiscal  a basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a potential increase in interest expense of approximately  for fiscal as of january   we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we contract for and settle all purchases in us dollars 
we only purchase a modest amount of goods directly from international vendors 
thus  we consider the effect of currency rate changes to be indirect and we believe the effect of a major shift in currency exchange rates on short term results would be minimal  as a hypothetical change in the foreign exchange rate of the chinese currency against the us dollar as of january  would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows 
over a longer period  the cumulative year to year impact of such changes  especially the exchange rate of the chinese currency against the us dollar  could be significant  albeit indirectly  through increased charges in us dollars from our vendors that source their products internationally
