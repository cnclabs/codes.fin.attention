the principal source of revenues from franchising hotels is ongoing franchise fees  which are comprised of royalty fees and other fees relating to marketing and reservation services 
ongoing franchise fees typically are based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchised hotel and are intended to cover the use of our trademarks and our operating expenses  such as expenses incurred for franchise services  including quality assurance and administrative support  and to provide us with operating profits

lodging revenues also include initial franchise fees  which are recognized as revenues when all material services or conditions have been substantially performed  which is either when a franchised hotel opens for business or when a franchise agreement is terminated after it has been determined that the franchised hotel will not open

we recognize revenues from annual membership dues on a straight line basis over the membership period during which delivery of publications  if applicable  and other services are provided to the members 
exchange fees are generated when members exchange their intervals for intervals at other properties within our vacation exchange business or for other leisure related services and products

our vacation rentals business primarily derives its revenues from fees  which generally average between and of the gross booking fees for non proprietary inventory  except for where we receive of the revenues for properties that we manage  operate under long term capital leases or own 
the majority of the time  we act on behalf of the owners of the rental properties to generate our fees

vacation ownership we develop  market and sell vois to individual consumers  provide property management services at resorts and provide consumer financing in connection with the sale of vois 
our vacation ownership business derives the majority of its revenues from sales of vois and derives other revenues from consumer financing and property management 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or developer financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues from voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting described in the guidance for sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for non delivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues from voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
in accordance with the guidance for accounting for real estate time sharing transactions  we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenues and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
we also offer consumer financing as an option to customers purchasing vois  which are typically collateralized by the underlying voi 
the contractual terms of company provided financing agreements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is recorded at the time of the sale with a charge to the provision for loan losses  which is classified as a reduction of vacation ownership interest sales on the consolidated statements of income 
the interest income earned from the financing arrangements is earned on the principal balance outstanding over the life of the arrangement and is recorded within consumer financing on the consolidated statements of income 
we also provide day to day management services  including oversight of housekeeping services  maintenance and certain accounting and administrative services for property owners associations and clubs 
in some cases  our employees serve as officers and or directors of these associations and clubs in accordance with their by laws and associated regulations 
we receive fees for such property management services which are

other items we record marketing and reservation revenues  wyndham rewards revenues  rci elite rewards revenues and hotel property management services revenues for our lodging  vacation ownership and vacation exchange and rentals segments  in accordance with the guidance for reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues be recorded on a gross basis 
discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenues and ebitda  which is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization  interest expense excluding consumer financing interest  interest income excluding consumer financing interest and income taxes  each of which is presented on the consolidated statements of income 
we believe that ebitda is a useful measure of performance for our industry segments which  when considered with gaap measures  gives a more complete understanding of our operating performance 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

net revenues and ebitda were favorably impacted by million and million  respectively  as a result of the tryp hotel brand acquisition in the second quarter of excluding the impact of the tryp acquisition  net revenues reflects a million increase in royalties and marketing and reservation fees inclusive of wyndham rewards primarily due to i a increase in revpar resulting from stronger occupancy and daily rates  ii an increase in our international system size and iii the impact of a million increase related to a change in the classification of third party reservation fees to revenues from marketing expenses  which were misclassified as contra expenses in prior periods 
this change in classification had no impact on ebitda 
net revenue was also favorably impacted by million related due to the opening of our wyndham grand hotel in orlando in the fourth quarter of such increases were partially offset by a million decrease in ancillary services revenues and other franchise fees 
in addition  ebitda was also unfavorably impacted by i million of higher marketing and reservation expenses inclusive of wyndham rewards resulting primarily from higher revenues and ii million of operating and pre opening costs for our wyndham grand hotel in orlando

a weaker us dollar compared to other foreign currencies contributed million and million in net revenues and ebitda  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we completed the acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of two vacation rental businesses in colorado and florida 
this resulted in the addition of over  units to our portfolio 
our vacation exchange and rentals business now offers its leisure travelers access to approximately  vacation properties worldwide 
acquisitions contributed million of incremental net revenues inclusive of million of ancillary revenues and million of incremental ebitda 
ebitda was also favorably impacted by a decline of million in costs incurred in connection with acquisitions 

table of contents excluding the impact of million of incremental vacation rental revenues from acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements of million  net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million primarily due to a increase in average net price per vacation rental 
the increase in average net price per vacation rental resulted from i higher yield at our novasol and landal greenparks businesses and ii an million impact primarily related to a change in the classification of third party sales commission fees to operating expenses which were misclassified as contra revenue in the same period last year 
this change in classification had no impact on ebitda 
rental transaction volume remained relatively flat 
exchange and related service revenues  which primarily consist of fees generated from memberships  exchange transactions  member related rentals and other member servicing  increased million 
excluding million of a favorable impact from foreign exchange movements  exchange and related service revenues remained flat primarily due to an increase in other transaction fee revenue offset by lower exchange and member rental transactions  which we believe are the result of the impact of growth in club memberships where there is a lower propensity to transact 
other transaction fee revenue increased from combining deposited timeshare intervals  which allows members the ability to transact into higher valued vacations  and the impact of a million increase related to a change in the classification of third party credit card processing fees to operating expenses  which were misclassified as contra revenue in prior periods 
this change in classification had no impact on ebitda 
we expect net revenues of approximately billion to billion during in addition  as compared to  we expect our operating statistics during to perform as follows vacation rental transactions to increase to  average net price per vacation rental to be flat to down due to the negative impact of foreign currency  average number of members to be flat to down  and exchange revenue per member to be flat to up 
during  we generated approximately million of revenues from our european businesses 
as such  any adverse outcome resulting from the instability in the european debt and related financial markets and the associated volatility on foreign exchange and interest rates could potentially have an impact on our results 
vacation ownership net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during compared with gross sales of vois  net of waam sales increased million driven principally by an increase in tour flow and a increase in vpg 
the increase in vpg is attributable to an increase in the average price per transaction  while the change in tour flow reflects our focus on marketing programs directed towards new owner generation 
our provision for loan losses decreased million primarily as a result of improved portfolio performance  partially offset by higher gross voi sales 
in addition  net revenues were unfavorably impacted by a million decrease in ancillary revenues  primarily associated with a misclassification of fees related to incidental voi operations  partially offset by increased fees generated by other non core operations 
this change in classification from gross basis reporting in revenues to net basis reporting in operating expenses had no impact on ebitda 
net revenues and ebitda generated by our waam increased by million and million  respectively  due to increased commissions earned on million of higher voi sales under our waam 

table of contents property management net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from higher reimbursement revenues and higher fees for additional services 
the reimbursement revenues have no impact on ebitda 
net revenues were unfavorably impacted by million and ebitda was favorably impacted by million due to lower consumer financing revenues attributable to a decline in our contract receivables portfolio which was more than offset in ebitda by a million decrease in interest expense on our securitized debt 
compared to last year  our net interest income margin increased to from due to i a reduction in our weighted average interest rate to from and ii higher weighted average interest rates earned on our contract receivable portfolio  partially offset by million of increased average borrowings on our securitized debt facilities

corporate and other corporate expenses increased million in compared to corporate expenses included a million and million net benefit related to the resolution of and adjustment to certain contingent liabilities and assets during and  respectively 
excluding the impact of these net benefits  corporate expenses increased by million 
the million increase in expenses were primarily due to i million of increased costs for data security enhancements  ii million of higher employee related costs and iii million of an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange hedging contracts costs partially offset by a million gain related to the redemption of a preferred stock investment allocated to us in connection with the separation 
other revenues decreased by million with a corresponding decrease in expenses due to the elimination of the wyndham trademark fee charged between the lodging segment and the vacation ownership segment

as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants described above 
each of our non recourse  securitized term notes and the bank conduit facility contain various triggers relating to the performance of the applicable loan pools 
if the vacation ownership contract receivables pool that collateralizes one of our securitization notes fails to perform within the parameters established by the contractual triggers such as higher default or delinquency rates  there are provisions pursuant to which the cash flows for

as of december   all of our securitized loan pools were in compliance with applicable contractual triggers 
liquidity risk our vacation ownership business finances certain of its receivables through i an asset backed bank conduit facility and ii periodically accessing the capital markets by issuing asset backed securities 
none of the currently outstanding asset backed securities contains any recourse provisions to us other than interest rate risk related to swap counterparties solely to the extent that the amount outstanding on our notes differs from the forecasted amortization schedule at the time of issuance 
we believe that our bank conduit facility  with a term through june and capacity of million  combined with our ability to issue term asset backed securities  should provide sufficient liquidity for our expected sales pace and we expect to have available liquidity to finance the sale of vois 
our billion five year revolving credit agreement  which expires in july  contains a provision that is a condition of an extension of credit 
the provision  which was standard market practice for issuers of our rating and industry at the time of our revolver renewal  allows the lenders to withhold an extension of credit if the representations and warranties we made at the time we executed the revolving credit facility agreement are not true and correct  in all material respects  at the time of the request of the extension of credit including if a development or event has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  operations or condition  financial or otherwise 
the application of the material adverse effect provision contains exclusions for the impact resulting from disruptions in  or the inability of companies engaged in businesses similar to those engaged in by us and our subsidiaries to consummate financings in  the asset backed securities or conduit market 
we primarily utilize surety bonds at our vacation ownership business for sales and development transactions in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states 
in the ordinary course of our business  we have assembled commitments from twelve surety providers in the amount of billion  of which we had million outstanding as of december  the availability  terms and conditions  and pricing of such bonding capacity is dependent on  among other things  continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing such bonding capacity  the general availability of such capacity and our corporate credit rating 
if such bonding capacity is unavailable or  alternatively  if the terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity are unacceptable to us  our vacation ownership business could be negatively impacted 
our liquidity position may also be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the capital markets in which we operate or if our vacation ownership contract receivables portfolios do not meet specified portfolio credit parameters 
our liquidity as it relates to our vacation ownership contract receivables securitization program could be adversely affected if we were to fail to renew or replace our conduit facility on its expiration date or if a particular receivables pool were to fail to meet certain ratios  which could occur in certain instances if the default rates or other credit metrics of the underlying vacation ownership contract receivables deteriorate 
our ability to sell securities backed by our vacation ownership contract receivables depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities 
as of december   we had million of availability under our asset backed bank conduit facility 
any disruption to the asset backed or commercial paper markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain such financings

as a result of the sale of realogy on april   realogy s senior debt credit rating was downgraded to below investment grade 
under the separation agreement  if realogy experienced such a change of control and suffered such a ratings downgrade  it was required to post a letter of credit in an amount acceptable to us and avis budget group to satisfy the fair value of realogy s indemnification obligations for the cendant legacy contingent liabilities in the event realogy does not otherwise satisfy such obligations to the extent they become due 
on april   realogy posted a million irrevocable standby letter of credit from a major commercial bank in favor of avis budget group and upon which demand may be made if realogy does not otherwise satisfy its obligations for its share of the cendant legacy contingent liabilities 
the letter of credit can be adjusted from time to time based upon the outstanding contingent liabilities and has an expiration date of september  subject to renewal and certain provisions 
during december  such letter of credit was reduced to million 
the posting of this letter of credit does not relieve or limit realogy s obligations for these liabilities 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenues and net income from our franchise and management fees  commission income earned from renting vacation properties  annual subscription fees or annual membership dues  as applicable  and exchange and member related transaction fees and sales of vois 
revenues from franchise and management fees are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters  because of increased leisure travel during the summer months 
revenues from vacation rentals are generally highest in the third quarter  when vacation rentals are highest 
revenues from vacation exchange and member related transaction fees are generally highest in the first quarter  which is generally when members of our vacation exchange business plan and book their vacations for the year 
revenues from sales of vois are generally higher in the third quarter than in other quarters 
the seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
as we expand into new markets and geographical locations  we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results different from the fluctuations we have experienced in the past 
separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries transfer of cendant corporate liabilities and issuance of guarantees to cendant and affiliates pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement  upon the distribution of our common stock to cendant shareholders  we entered into certain guarantee commitments with cendant pursuant to the assumption of certain liabilities and the obligation to indemnify cendant  realogy and travelport for such liabilities and guarantee commitments related to deferred compensation arrangements with each of cendant and realogy 
these guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities  contingent tax liabilities  and cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities  of which we assumed and are responsible for while realogy is responsible for the remaining 
the remaining amount of liabilities which we assumed in connection with the separation was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts were comprised of certain cendant corporate liabilities which were recorded on the books of cendant as well as additional liabilities which were established for guarantees issued at the date of separation related to certain unresolved contingent matters and certain others that could arise during the guarantee period 
regarding the guarantees  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability  we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
we also provided a default guarantee related to certain deferred compensation arrangements related to certain current and former senior officers and directors of cendant  
table of contents realogy and travelport 
these arrangements  which are discussed in more detail below  have been valued upon the separation in accordance with the guidance for guarantees and recorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent such recorded liabilities are not adequate to cover the ultimate payment amounts  such excess will be reflected as an expense to the results of operations in future periods 
as of december   the million of separation related liabilities is comprised of million for tax liabilities  million for liabilities of previously sold businesses of cendant  million for other contingent and corporate liabilities and million of liabilities where the calculated guarantee amount exceeded the contingent liability assumed at the date of separation 
in connection with these liabilities  million is recorded in current due to former parent and subsidiaries and million is recorded in long term due to former parent and subsidiaries as of december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
we will indemnify cendant for these contingent liabilities and therefore any payments would be made to the third party through the former parent 
the million relating to guarantees is recorded in other current liabilities as of december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
the actual timing of payments relating to these liabilities is dependent on a variety of factors beyond our control 
see contractual obligations for the estimated timing of such payments 
in addition  as of december   we had million of receivables due from former parent and subsidiaries primarily relating to income taxes  which is recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
such receivables totaled million as of december  see item a

in addition to the above and in connection with our separation from cendant  we entered into certain guarantee commitments with cendant pursuant to our assumption of certain liabilities and our obligation to indemnify cendant  realogy and travelport for such liabilities and guarantee commitments related to deferred compensation arrangements with each of cendant and realogy 
these guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities  contingent tax liabilities  and cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities  of which we assumed and are responsible for of these cendant liabilities 
additionally  if any of 
table of contents the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability  we are responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
we also provide a default guarantee related to certain deferred compensation arrangements related to certain current and former senior officers and directors of cendant and realogy 
these arrangements were valued upon our separation from cendant with the assistance of third party experts in accordance with guidance for guarantees and recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet 
to the extent such recorded liabilities are not adequate to cover the ultimate payment amounts  such excess will be reflected as an expense to our results of operations in future periods 
see separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries discussion for details of guaranteed liabilities 
other commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements purchase commitments 
in the normal course of business  we make various commitments to purchase goods or services from specific suppliers  including those related to vacation ownership resort development and other capital expenditures 
purchase commitments made by us as of december  aggregated million 
individually  such commitments range as high as million related to the development of a vacation ownership resort 
approximately million of the commitments relate to the development of vacation ownership properties and information technology 
standard guarantees indemnifications 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that contain standard guarantees and indemnities whereby we indemnify another party for specified breaches of or third party claims relating to an underlying agreement 
such underlying agreements are typically entered into by one of our subsidiaries 
the various underlying agreements generally govern purchases  sales or outsourcing of products or services  leases of real estate  licensing of software and or development of vacation ownership properties  access to credit facilities  derivatives and issuances of debt securities 
while a majority of these guarantees and indemnifications extend only for the duration of the underlying agreement  some survive the expiration of the agreement 
we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees and indemnifications as the triggering events are not predictable 
in certain cases we maintain insurance coverage that may mitigate any potential payments 
other guarantees indemnifications 
in the ordinary course of business  our vacation ownership business provides guarantees to certain owners associations for funds required to operate and maintain vacation ownership properties in excess of assessments collected from owners of the vois 
we may be required to fund such excess as a result of unsold company owned vois or failure by owners to pay such assessments 
in addition  from time to time  we will agree to reimburse certain owner associations up to of their uncollected assessments 
these guarantees extend for the duration of the underlying subsidy or similar agreement which generally approximate one year and are renewable at our discretion on an annual basis or until a stipulated percentage typically or higher of related vois are sold 
the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees was approximately million as of december  we would only be required to pay this maximum amount if none of the owners assessed paid their assessments 
any assessments collected from the owners of the vois would reduce the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made by us 
additionally  should we be required to fund the deficit through the payment of any owners assessments under these guarantees  we would be permitted access to the property for our own use and may use that property to engage in revenue producing activities  such as rentals 
during  and  we made payments related to these guarantees of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we maintained a liability in connection with these guarantees of million and million  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
from time to time  we may enter into a hotel management agreement that provides the hotel owner with a minimum return 
under such agreement  we would be required to compensate for any shortfall over the life of the management agreement up to a specified aggregate amount 
our exposure under these guarantees is partially mitigated by our ability to terminate any such management agreement if certain targeted operating results are not 
table of contents met 
additionally  we are able to recapture a portion or all of the shortfall payments and any waived fees in the event that future operating results exceed targets 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees was million with an annual cap of million or less 
as of both december  and  we maintained a liability in connection with these guarantees of less than million on our consolidated balance sheets 
as part of our waam  we may guarantee to reimburse the developer a certain payment or to purchase from the developer inventory associated with the developer s resort property for a percentage of the original sale price if certain future conditions exist 
the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees was approximately million as of december  as of both december  and  we had no recognized liabilities in connection with these guarantees 
securitizations 
we pool qualifying vacation ownership contract receivables and sell them to bankruptcy remote entities all of which are consolidated into the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  letters of credit 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding  which mainly support development activity at our vacation ownership business 
critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
vacation ownership revenue recognition 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or seller financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues of voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting described in the guidance for sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for non delivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues on voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
in accordance with the requirements of the guidance for real estate time sharing transactions we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
the contractual terms of seller provided financing arrangements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 

table of contents if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the poc method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenues and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
until a contract for sale qualifies for revenue recognition  all payments received are accounted for as restricted cash and deposits within other current assets and deferred income  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
commissions and other direct costs related to the sale are deferred until the sale is recorded 
if a contract is cancelled before qualifying as a sale  non recoverable expenses are charged to the current period as part of operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
changes in costs could lead to adjustments to the poc status of a project  which may result in differences in the timing and amount of revenues recognized from the construction of vacation ownership properties 
this policy is discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
in our vacation ownership segment  we provide for estimated vacation ownership contract receivable cancellations at the time of voi sales by recording a provision for loan losses as a reduction of voi sales on the consolidated statements of income 
we assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the historical performance of similar vacation ownership contract receivables 
we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis  which tracks defaults for each year s sales over the entire life of those contract receivables 
we consider current defaults  past due aging  historical write offs of contracts and consumer credit scores fico scores in the assessment of borrower s credit strength and expected loan performance 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
if current conditions differ from the conditions in effect when the historical experience was generated  we adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect the expected effects of the current environment on the collectability of our vacation ownership contract receivables 
impairment of long lived assets 
with regard to the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in connection with business combinations  we annually during the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to completing our annual forecasting process or  more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  review the reporting units carrying values as required by the guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in the guidance 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting unit within the company that has recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit 
purchase business combination accounting rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared to the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit  and if lower  the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount 
in accordance with the guidance  we have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments 
quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  therefore  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including 
table of contents the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows  including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises  market conditions change or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding whether existing goodwill is impaired could change and result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in performing our impairment analysis  we develop our estimated fair values for our reporting units using a combination of the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit 
the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow methodology uses our projections of financial performance for a five year period 
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate  the terminal value and expected future revenues  gross margins and operating margins  which vary among reporting units 
we use a market multiple methodology to estimate the terminal value of each reporting unit by comparing such reporting unit to other publicly traded companies that are similar from an operational and economic standpoint 
the market multiple methodology compares each reporting unit to the comparable companies on the basis of risk characteristics in order to determine the risk profile relative to the comparable companies as a group 
this analysis generally focuses on quantitative considerations  which include financial performance and other quantifiable data  and qualitative considerations  which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance 
the most significant assumption affecting our estimate of the terminal value of each reporting unit is the multiple of the enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization 
to support our estimate of the individual reporting unit fair values  a comparison is performed between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our market capitalization 
we use an average of our market capitalization over a reasonable period preceding the impairment testing date as being more reflective of our stock price trend than a single day  point in time market price 
the difference is an implied control premium  which represents the acknowledgment that the observed market prices of individual trades of a company s stock may not be representative of the fair value of the company as a whole 
estimates of a company s control premium are highly judgmental and depend on capital market and macro economic conditions overall 
we evaluate the implied control premium for reasonableness 
based on the results of our impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of  we determined that no impairment charge of goodwill was required as the fair value of goodwill at our lodging and vacation exchange and rentals reporting units was substantially in excess of the carrying value 
we continue to monitor the goodwill recorded at our lodging and vacation exchange and rentals reporting units for indicators of impairment 
if economic conditions were to deteriorate more than expected  or other significant assumptions such as estimates of terminal value were to change significantly  we may be required to record an impairment of the goodwill balance at our lodging and vacation and exchange and rentals reporting units 
we determine whether the carrying value of other indefinite lived intangible assets is impaired on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
application of the other indefinite lived intangible assets impairment test requires judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine fair value 
the fair value of each other indefinite lived intangible asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including anticipated market conditions  
table of contents operating expense trends  estimation of future cash flows  which are dependent on internal forecasts  and estimation of long term rate of growth 
the estimates used to calculate the fair value of an other indefinite lived intangible asset change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions 
changes in these estimates and assumption could materially affect the determination of fair value and the other indefinite lived intangible assets impairment 
we also evaluate the recoverability of our other long lived assets  including property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred  pursuant to guidance for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated from such assets 
property and equipment is evaluated separately within each segment 
if such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable  the carrying value of such assets is reduced to fair value 
business combinations 
a component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations 
we account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance for business combinations and related literature 
accordingly  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of purchase 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we use various recognized valuation methods including present value modeling and referenced market values where available 
further  we make assumptions within certain valuation techniques including discount rates and timing of future cash flows 
valuations are performed by management or independent valuation specialists under management s supervision  where appropriate 
we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use 
however  such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting for restructuring activities 
restructuring actions require us to make significant estimates in several areas including i expenses for severance and related benefit costs  ii the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations  and iii contract terminations 
the amounts that we have accrued as of december  represent our best estimate of the obligations that we incurred in connection with these actions  but could be subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties 
in the event actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized 
in performing this review  we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations 
for tax positions we have taken or expect to take in our tax return  we apply a more likely than not threshold  under which we must conclude a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  assuming that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  in order to recognize or continue to recognize the benefit 
in determining our provision for income taxes  we use judgment  reflecting our estimates and assumptions  in applying the more likely than not threshold 

table of contents adoption of accounting pronouncements during  we adopted the guidance related to the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
additionally  we early adopted recently issued guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income 
during  we will adopt guidance related to the testing goodwill for impairment and fair value measurement 
for detailed information regarding these standards and the impact thereof on our financial statements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts and interest rate caps to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt 
foreign currency forwards and options are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
our primary interest rate exposure as of december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and asset backed commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
in addition  interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can impact us 
we anticipate that libor and asset backed commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound and euro 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
any adverse reaction resulting from the financial instability within certain european economies could potentially have an effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have approximately billion of debt outstanding as of december  of that total  million was issued as variable rate debt and has not been synthetically converted to fixed rate debt via an interest rate swap 
a hypothetical change in our effective weighted average interest rate would not generate a material change in interest expense 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate carrying values due to the short term nature of these assets 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of vacation ownership contract receivables 
the primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates and discount rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt and interest rate derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of our foreign currency derivatives used by us to hedge underlying exposure that primarily consist of the non functional current assets and liabilities of us and our subsidiaries 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or 
table of contents strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures as of december  the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are largely offset by the gains and losses on the underlying assets  liabilities or expected cash flows 
as of december   the absolute notional amount of our outstanding foreign exchange hedging instruments was million 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would result in an immaterial change in the fair value of the hedging instrument as of december  such a change would be largely offset by an opposite effect on the underlying assets  liabilities and expected cash flows 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december  market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and foreign currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates
