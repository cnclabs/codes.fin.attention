item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k 
intellectual property the name lowe s is a registered service mark of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business 
this subsidiary has various additional trademarks  trade names and service marks  most of which are used in our private brand program 
environmental leadership we continue to build on a history of environmental leadership by helping consumers reduce their energy and water use and their environmental footprint while saving money through a growing number of product and service solutions 
we offer a wide selection of environmentally responsible and energy efficient products for the home  including energy star appliances  watersense labeled toilets  paint with no volatile organic compounds voc  indoor and outdoor led lighting  the ge geospring hybrid water heater  and in certain states  ge electric car charging stations 
additionally  we offer in store customer recycling for plastic bags  cfl light bulbs and rechargeable batteries 
our role in helping consumers with their conservation was recognized by the us environmental protection agency epa with our second consecutive energy star sustained excellence award in retail  which recognizes our long standing leadership as a retailer of energy efficient products  as well as nine consecutive energy star awards  including four energy star partner of the year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency 
we were also recognized by the epa watersense program with our third consecutive retail partner of the year award 
lowe s also recognizes how efficient operations can help protect the environment and our bottom line 
we examine our own operations to deliver efficiencies in energy use  water consumption and waste recycling 
we annually track our carbon footprint and participate in the carbon disclosure project  an independent not for profit organization holding the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of our energy use  we also purchase renewable energy certificates rec equal to of our energy use  and are recognized as the sixth largest retail purchaser of green power in the epa s green power partnership program 
to further reduce our footprint  we design energy efficient features into new stores and during retrofits of existing stores 
these features include energy efficient lighting  white membrane cool roofs and hvac units that meet or exceed energy star qualifications 
we also strive to get products to our stores in an environmentally responsible manner 
we achieve that through involvement in the smartway transport partnership  an innovative program launched by the us epa in that promotes environmentally cleaner  more fuel efficient transportation options 
our latest recognition came in when we earned the smartway team champion 
this award was based on initiatives that resulted in reduced carbon dioxide emissions and less overall highway congestion 
these included increasing shipping by rail  increasing efficiency of truckload shipments  allowing more products to be shipped on fewer trailers  and continuing to use a higher percentage of smartway carriers

item a risk factors we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys  external research  risk mapping  analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational  financial  environmental  reputational  strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business 
for more information about our risk management process  which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify  see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item of part iii of this annual report on form k under board s role in the risk management process 
we describe below all known material risks that could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or business prospects 
these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended  supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form k  form q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form k  in our annual report to lowe s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission  as well as in our press releases and other public communications  are qualified by the risks described below 
our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 
general economic factors and other conditions  both domestically and internationally  may adversely affect the us economy  the global economy and our financial performance 
these include  but are not limited to  periods of slow economic growth or recession  volatility and or lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and or higher cost of borrowing to lowe s and its customers  slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income  sustained high rates of unemployment  high consumer debt levels  increasing fuel and energy costs  inflation or deflation of commodity prices  natural disasters  acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia  the middle east and other parts of the world 
adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store sales 
sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects 
steep declines in recent years home prices  the increasing number of households with little or negative equity  high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates  the reduction in the availability of mortgage financing  slower household formation growth rates  and lower housing turnover through existing home sales  have limited  and may continue to limit  consumers discretionary spending  particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to our business 
changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business 
laws and regulations at the local  regional  state  federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors 
any changes in regulations  the imposition of additional regulations  or the enactment of any new legislation that affect employment labor  trade  product safety  transportation logistics  energy costs  health care  tax or environmental issues  could have an adverse impact  directly or indirectly  on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations can increase our cost of doing business 
in addition  we are subject to various procurement regulations applicable to our contracts for sales to the u 
s government and could be adversely affected by changes in those regulations or any negative findings from an audit or investigation 
we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising  marketing and distribution strategies effectively 
we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small  direct and indirect competitors 
the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment with heavy promotions  particularly of discretionary items 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores  customer service  quality and price of merchandise and services  in stock levels  and merchandise assortment and presentation 
our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance 
moreover  changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors  including the effects of competitor liquidation activities  may impact our expected results 
our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 
part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors 
to better distinguish our product offering  we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names 
the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 
expanding internationally presents unique challenges that will require us to adapt our store operations  merchandising  marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico and to work effectively with our joint venture partner in australia 
a significant portion of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico 
we are also in a joint venture with australia s largest retailer  woolworths limited  to develop a network of home improvement stores for consumers in australia 
expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks  and slow the anticipated rate  of such expansion 
if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame  cost and functionality  our strategic initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful 
the success of our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers expenditures on home improvement projects is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them 
extended delays or cost overruns in securing  developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the new business initiatives we are developing now  and will be developing in the future  would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 
we may not be able to achieve the objectives of the strategic initiatives we have underway if our organization is unable to make the transformational changes we are undertaking in our business model 
we are adapting our business model to meet our customers changing expectations that we will not only sell them the products and services they need and want  but also deliver  using new tools  skills and processes  a full service experience by being a part of their home improvement projects from start to finish 
our strategies require transformational changes to our business model and will require new competencies in some positions  and our employees and independent contractors  such as third party installers and repair technicians  will not only have to understand non traditional selling platforms but also commit to fundamental changes in lowe s culture and the processes through which they have traditionally interacted with customers 
to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes  our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers expenditures on home improvement projects may not be as successful as we expect them to be 
the many challenges our management faces in effectively managing our business as we adapt our business model also increase the risk that we may not achieve our objectives 
our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 
an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions  and sales and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as inventory replenishment  merchandise ordering  transportation  receipt processing and product delivery 
our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain  improve  upgrade  and expand our systems 
as customer facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our multi channel sales and marketing strategy  the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 
access to the internet from computers  smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them 
our website  lowes 
com  is a sales channel for our products  and is also a method of making product  project and other relevant information available to them that influences our in store sales 
in addition to lowes 
com  we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire  inform  cross sell  establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers 
performance issues with these customer facing technology systems or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers perceptions of lowe s as a reliable source of information about home improvement products and services 
our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer  employee or vendor data or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect such data 
cyber attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving  and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of confidential information have occurred recently at a number of major us companies despite widespread recognition of the cyber attack threat and improved data protection methods 
while we have invested in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security procedures and controls over financial and other individually identifiable customer  employee and vendor data provided to us  a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions  loss of business or potential liability  including for possible punitive damages 
an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks 
in addition  as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other company s obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter  a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 
if we fail to hire  train  manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists  or contract with qualified installers and repair technicians  with expanded skill sets who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment  we could lose sales to our competitors 
our customers  whether they are homeowners or commercial businesses  expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide 
our customers also expect the independent contractors who install products they purchase from us to perform the installation in a timely and capable manner 
increasingly  our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets  including in some instances the ability to do in home or telephone sales 
in addition  in many of our stores our employees and third party contractors must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 
also  as our employees as a group become increasingly culturally diverse  our managers and sales associates must be able to manage and work collaboratively with employees whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 

table of contents failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 
no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than of our total purchases  but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell 
we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business 
if these vendors or service providers fail or are unable to perform as expected and we are unable to replace them quickly  our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to do so and potentially  in some cases  permanently 
failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales  profitability  cash flows and financial condition 
product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe s and the company s brand image 
as a result  lowe s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services  including both national and lowe s private brands  could suffer and impact customer loyalty 
additionally  a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls  product liability and warranty claims 
if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted  our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 
we source the approximately  products we stock and sell from over  domestic and international vendors 
we source a large number of those products from foreign manufacturers 
financial instability among key vendors  political instability  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs 
future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences  including judgments or settlements 
we are  and in the future will become  involved in lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
some of these proceedings raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities 
the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain 
additionally  the possible outcomes of  or resolutions to  these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements  either of which could require substantial payments 
none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved  individually or collectively  is considered material

we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this discussion and analysis is presented in seven sections executive overview operations lowe s business outlook financial condition  liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates executive overview during we made progress towards delivering better customer experiences and transforming our business to drive long term sales growth  increased profitability and increased shareholder value 
we operate in an increasingly socially connected world with real time expectations and a wide range of customer service and selling channels 
our goal is to be relevant at each step of the home improvement process and to deliver an experience that is both seamless and simple 
rather than be a home improvement retailer focused on store expansion as the engine for growth  we will be a home improvement company focused on maximizing asset productivity in order to grow 
building the foundation recognizing the need to adapt to this increasingly connected environment  we made a series of important decisions during these decisions included investments to position us for improved execution today  while enabling the customer experiences that will carry us into the future 
first  we implemented changes to our management structure  including the makeup of our senior executive team 
we also rationalized our existing and future store investments and accelerated significant upgrades to our information technology it infrastructure 
understanding the importance of responding quickly to the needs of the market  we reorganized our field based store operations and human resources organizations during  reducing the field structure from districts to markets 
this followed our decision in late to modify a portion of our mid level store management structure from a tiered structure into a single level assistant store manager position 
as a result  we are able to better coordinate our business and to push down the appropriate level of decision making and accountability to the working teams 
in addition to changes in management structure  we performed a comprehensive review of our existing stores and our pipeline of proposed new stores during in an effort to focus resources in a manner that will generate the greatest shareholder value 
as a result  we closed underperforming stores in the second half of the year and discontinued a number of planned new store projects 
as part of the reassessment we also revised our future store expansion plan in north america and expect to open approximately stores in  and approximately stores per year thereafter 
this represents a reduction in our previous expansion plan 
in  we also accelerated our investments in it and store systems infrastructure and increased our efforts to improve the customer experience 
we undertook our largest  single year investment in it and store systems infrastructure to eliminate problems with slow response times  hard to use systems  and lack of access to necessary technology 
this included upgrades to store it bandwidth and the installation of in store wireless networks to handle video downloads and provide customer access to wi fi 
in addition  we enhanced existing store functionality with iphones to provide store employees with better tools to assist the customer anywhere in the store 
these efforts contributed to the company s total investments in it infrastructure of million in in  we will continue to evaluate our corporate infrastructure  which was built to support a single channel business that was opening over stores per year 
today we are growing differently and our seamless multi channel strategy requires a different infrastructure 
in the first few weeks of  we announced a planned reduction in the size of the staff at our us headquarters through a voluntary separation program 
in addition  we are also working to change our culture to enable our teams to move faster on calculated risks in order to improve our execution and to support changing customer expectations 
we are refining our test and learn capabilities to more quickly and cost effectively test new ideas before implementing changes company wide 
our promise for the future our promise continues to focus on three themes possibilities regarding home improvement solutions  support and advice along the way  and providing value beyond price 
keeping this promise requires us to maintain our commitment to retail excellence  develop capabilities to provide seamless support across channels and projects  and simplify the home improvement experience 
retail excellence in order to maintain our retail excellence  our near term focus is on value improvement and product differentiation  both of which will drive greater asset productivity 
our goal is to be the most efficient retailer our vendors do business with  and we are working with them in a collaborative manner to identify costs that do not add value 
by eliminating these costs we are able to provide customers with the most competitively priced products every day across the multiple channels that they shop  driving increases in sales and gross margin 
value improvement is built on a foundation of every day low cost and tailored market assorting to ensure that we have the right product  in the right market  in the right quantity at the right price 
this will ensure that we are getting the lowest inventory acquisition cost and rationalizing the use of promotions  which will allow us to provide low every day retail prices 
every day low prices result in more steady demand  eliminating the peaks and valleys associated with promotions which will make us and our vendors more efficient 
during  we also began implementing our integrated planning execution ip e tools  which ensure that our product assortments are locally customized and supported by the right level of inventory per store to produce better productivity for high turning products 
our market analysis teams work closely with merchants as they use the ip e tools to create the most efficient and effective product lines in each local market  improving our relevance to the customer 
this process creates greater depth of in stock  high turning items  and reduces the breadth of items with lower turns 
product differentiation will establish lowe s as the place to find the newest and most relevant products for home improvement and involves refreshing displays in our stores  while at the same time  expanding our online product assortments beyond what we stock in our stores to meet the demands of customers 
through our test and learn approach  we have rolled out a new store layout to approximately stores using interactive endcaps that leverage innovative technology and consistent presentation to inspire our customers to attempt new and exciting projects they may not have otherwise considered 
in addition  we lowered or completely removed racking in key areas of the store to better display our products and to make them more accessible and visible to customers 
as we test new concepts we will integrate those that work best into the store layout as we expand it to approximately additional stores in we are creating a better shopping experience to deliver a compelling message of value and simplicity that will result in increased comparable store sales 
seamless across channels recognizing that customers increasingly shop across channels  we are focused on providing a seamless multi channel experience making it convenient for them to engage with us wherever and whenever they choose 
over the past year we have made additions and enhancements to enable the seamless experience  including interactions with our contact centers  our exterior sales programs  our website and our mobile applications 
we equipped our contact center associates with better tools and greater access to information as well as the ability to close a sale 
we continued to evolve our on site selling model providing specialists with the appropriate tools to help customers visualize a project  provide a real time quote and tender a sale on site 
we also made incremental improvements to our online platform and by the end of the year there were over  items available through our website and our top rated mobile application  which launched this past august 
together these improvements contributed to a increase in customer traffic and a increase in conversion rates  resulting in a increase in online sales year over year  and a basis point increase in online unit share 
in addition  we now offer preprinted return labels for parcel shipments free of charge  a simple and convenient option for customers and a competitive advantage in the home improvement industry 
furthermore  in december we announced the acquisition of atg stores  an online retailer of home improvement and lifestyle products  which will allow us to more than double the number of items available through lowes 
com in in addition to creating a more seamless experience for customers  we also invested in technology to ensure that customers have access to an even wider range of products beyond our stores via lowes 
com through the rollout of our flexible fulfillment process 
flexible fulfillment allows any product that can be shipped parcel post and that is stocked in a regional distribution center  store or vendor s distribution center to be ordered online and shipped directly to a customer s home or place of business 
in fiscal  we fulfilled more than  orders using our flexible fulfillment capabilities 
these are incremental transactions on products that were previously unavailable to customers online 
we continue to expand our flexible fulfillment capabilities  and in will have the capability to fulfill any order from the most efficient location  including our stores 
simple through knowledge and support in  we launched mylowes  an online tool that is unique in the home improvement industry and makes managing  maintaining and improving homes simpler and more intuitive than ever before 
mylowes provides customers with a wide range of abilities to create home profiles  save room dimensions and paint colors  organize owner s manuals and product warranties  create shopping lists and set recurring reminders for common maintenance items 
as of the end of the year we had nearly three million customers activate mylowes cards 
in addition  approximately of mylowes members are either new customers or customers who haven t shopped at lowe s in over a year 
we expect mylowes to enable us to better serve our existing customer base and attract new customers 
in addition  we have improved service in the aisles by equipping store employees with iphones and the necessary applications to give them immediate access to products and available quantities beyond the limits of the store s physical inventory 
no longer do store employees have to leave customers in the aisle to access a fixed terminal 
iphones give employees quick access to detailed information about products that customers are interested in and further supplements both the employee s existing knowledge and point of purchase materials we provide 
we have already seen a positive impact on the time it takes to serve customers  as well as the number of customers we are able to serve 
to leverage our employees knowledge  we launched connections  an online employee social business network that gives them the ability to easily share information at anytime 
employees have access to connections directly from the sales floor  thereby increasing their breadth of knowledge and improving the customer experience 
all of the enhancements we made in are building momentum in developing deeper relationships with our customers that we believe will enable us to close more sales and improve profitability in and beyond

the comparable store sales increase for included in the preceding table was calculated using sales for a comparable week period 
average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions 
average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period 
return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters 
return on average shareholders equity is defined as net earnings divided by average shareholders equity for the last five quarters 
return on invested capital is a non gaap measure 
see below for additional information 
return on invested capital return on invested capital roic is considered a non gaap financial measure 
we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the company uses capital to generate profits 
we define roic as trailing four quarters net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters 
although roic is a common financial metric  numerous methods exist for calculating roic 
accordingly  the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic 
we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 
we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic 
the difference between these two measures is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense 
the calculation of roic  together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity  the most comparable gaap financial measure  is as follows in millions  except percentage data calculation of return on invested capital numerator net earnings plus interest expense net provision for income taxes earnings before interest and taxes less income tax adjustment net operating profit after tax effective tax rate denominator average debt and equity return on invested capital calculation of return on average debt and equity numerator net earnings denominator average debt and equity return on average debt and equity income tax adjustment is defined as earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate 
average debt and equity is defined as average debt  including current maturities and short term borrowings  plus total equity for the last five quarters 
fiscal compared to fiscal for the purpose of the following discussion  comparable store sales  comparable store average ticket and comparable store customer transactions are based on comparable week periods 
net sales net sales increased to billion in  while comparable store sales were flat 
the additional week in contributed to the increase in net sales 
comparable store customer transactions increased approximately and comparable store average ticket decreased versus while comparable stores sales were flat in  we saw sequential improvement each quarter  with comparable store sales of negative in the first quarter  negative in the second quarter  positive in the third quarter and positive in the fourth quarter 
unseasonably cold  wet weather  severe storms and flooding during the first quarter as well as comparisons to the cash for appliances government incentive program led to lower performance during the first half of the year 
however  as comparisons to the cash for appliances program eased and storm recovery efforts were underway  we saw improvement in comparable store sales 
in addition  strong customer response to our off every day offer to lowe s credit cardholders  launched in the first half of  aided comparable store sales for the balance of the year 
we experienced comparable store sales above the company average in the following product categories during building materials  rough plumbing  tools  fashion electrical  paint and hardware 
in addition  home fashions  storage cleaning  seasonal living  flooring  nursery and lumber performed at approximately the overall company average 
although unfavorable weather in the early part of the year negatively impacted outdoor categories such as building materials  recovery efforts after severe spring storms that hit many regions of the country and hurricane irene positively impacted comparable store sales in building materials  with particularly strong sales of roofing products and installation services 
rough plumbing also benefited from the wet weather and storm recovery efforts  with strong sales of pumps tanks and dehumidifiers 
in addition  tools experienced favorable comparable store sales primarily driven by holiday promotions and strong customer response to new products  such as our new line of kobalt mechanics tools 
fashion electrical also performed above the company average during  driven by increased customer demand for energy saving light bulbs  outdoor lighting and electrical cable 
however  difficult comparisons to prior year energy tax credits negatively impacted comparable store sales in millwork 
in addition  while we experienced strong market share gains in cabinets countertops  they were not enough to offset the impact of the contracting market  leading to comparable store sales below the company average for the year 
appliances also experienced negative comparable store sales for the year driven by comparisons to the prior year cash for appliances program  which primarily impacted the first half of the year 
gross margin gross margin of for represented a basis point decrease from  primarily driven by margin rate 
strong customer response to our off every day offer to lowe s credit cardholders  targeted promotional activity and pricing changes associated with our move to every day low prices negatively impacted margin for the year 
margin was also negatively impacted by basis points associated with distribution expenses  primarily related to higher fuel costs 
in addition  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  primarily related to the stores that closed in the second half of the year  negatively impacted margin by six basis points 
these were partially offset by basis points of favorable impact associated with the mix of products sold across product categories 
sg a the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales from to was primarily driven by de leverage of basis points related to charges for store closings  discontinued projects and long lived asset impairments 
we also experienced approximately basis points of de leverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences  including expenses associated with additional internal and external staffing and technology expenditures 
in addition  we experienced de leverage in payroll taxes and fleet expense 
these increases were partially offset by leverage of approximately basis points associated with our proprietary credit program due to reduced program costs associated with lower losses and lower promotional financing as more customers took advantage of the off every day offer 
in addition  bonus expense leveraged basis points due to lower attainment levels for the year relative to plan 
depreciation depreciation expense leveraged basis points for compared to primarily due to a lower asset base resulting from decreased capital spending and assets becoming fully depreciated or impaired 
property  less accumulated depreciation  decreased to billion at february  compared to billion at january  at february  and january   we owned of our stores  which included stores on leased land 
interest net interest expense is comprised of the following in millions interest expense  net of amount capitalized amortization of original issue discount and loan costs interest income interest net net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of billion of notes during and billion of notes during  offset by the repayment of million of notes during income tax provision our effective income tax rate was in compared to in the reduction in the effective tax rate was predominantly due to the recognition of benefits from the federal hire hiring incentives to restore employment retention tax credit as well as various state tax credit programs 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased to billion in comparable store sales increased in compared to a decline of in we experienced comparable store sales increases over for each quarter and saw evidence of economic stabilization  as comparable store sales performance was more balanced across geographic markets in comparable store customer transactions increased  and comparable store average ticket increased versus  as larger project sales remained slow for the year 
overall  while growth in household spending moderately accelerated late in the year  it remained constrained by high unemployment  modest income growth  lower housing wealth and tight credit 
as a result  customers continued to focus on non discretionary and smaller discretionary projects during this focus was reflected by strength in categories that support smaller projects such as tools and lawn landscape  both of which outperformed the company average 
meanwhile  categories that are more discretionary in nature such as fashion plumbing  cabinets countertops and home fashions  storage cleaning were negatively impacted by the remaining market uncertainty and performed below the company average 
we seized opportunities during the year to drive additional sales by quickly executing programs that helped customers benefit from government incentives 
the cash for appliances rebate program  as well as our continued focus on market specific assortments to ensure that we have the right products in the right markets  helped drive comparable store sales increases above the company average for our appliances category 
in addition  our pse program  along with focused special order sales promotions  helped customers take advantage of the higher tax credits for energy efficient improvements that expired at the end of the year 
the pse program also helped us to increase our comparable store installed sales over  with the greatest growth occurring in millwork  lumber and building materials 
comparable store sales for our seasonal living category also outperformed the company average for the increase was driven by improved sell through of grills and grill accessories  patio furniture and holiday assortments  as well as increased sales of room air conditioners as a result of prolonged extreme heat across the us in the middle of the year 
gross margin gross margin of for represented a basis point increase over the increase was driven by improvements in margin rates  primarily in seasonal living  lumber and hardware  which resulted in basis points of improvement 
the rate increase is primarily attributable to better sell through of seasonal inventory this year relative to  our increased number of competitive pricing zones  and our base price optimization strategy 
the rate improvement was partially offset by a basis point unfavorable impact from the mix of products sold across categories  driven by increased sales in appliances 
sg a the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales from to was primarily driven by leverage of basis points in bonus expense  due to lower attainment levels relative to plan 
impairment and discontinued project expense leveraged basis points due to lower charges associated with existing stores as well as fewer construction projects discontinued in the current year 
we also experienced nine basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit programs due to decreased program costs for the year 
this was partially offset by de leverage in store payroll due to the impact of the new facilities service associate fsa position and wage growth  fleet expense due to increased deliveries related to free delivery promotions and increased average fuel costs  and bank card expense due to increased bank card transaction volume and higher transaction fees 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased slightly for compared to due to a lower asset base resulting from decreased capital spending and assets becoming fully depreciated in property  less accumulated depreciation  decreased to billion at january  compared to billion at january  at january  and january   we owned and of our stores  respectively  which included stores on leased land 
interest net interest expense is comprised of the following in millions interest expense  net of amount capitalized amortization of original issue discount and loan costs interest income interest net net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of billion of notes during and due to the impact of tax settlements that favorably impacted our tax related interest accruals in  offset by the repayment of million of notes during income tax provision our effective income tax rate was in versus in the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to certain prior year favorable state tax settlements  which decreased the effective tax rate by approximately basis points 
lowe s business outlook our fiscal year contains weeks as compared to our fiscal which contained weeks 
therefore  our fiscal growth rates  with the exception of comparable store sales which is computed on a week versus week basis  will be negatively impacted by comparing weeks with weeks in fiscal as of february   the date of our fourth quarter earnings release  we expected total sales in to increase to 
we expected comparable store sales to increase to in we expected to open approximately stores during earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales operating margin were expected to increase approximately basis points 
in addition  depreciation expense was expected to be approximately billion 
diluted earnings per share of to were expected for the fiscal year ending february  our guidance assumed approximately billion in share repurchases during  spread evenly across the four quarters 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for versus was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings  adjusted for non cash charges related to net losses on property and other assets  and changes in working capital 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for versus was driven by net cash inflows related to investments  partially offset by an increase in cash used for property acquired related to investments in corporate systems and store information technology 
net cash used in financing activities for was primarily driven by share repurchases of billion which was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of billion of notes in november net cash used in financing activities for was primarily driven by share repurchases of billion which was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of billion of notes in april and november and the repayment of million of notes that matured in june sources of liquidity in addition to our cash flows from operations  liquidity is provided by our short term borrowing facilities and through the issuance of long term debt 
on october   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement amended facility to modify the senior credit facility dated june  which provided for borrowings of up to billion through june the amended facility extends the maturity date to october and continues to provide for borrowings of up to billion 
the amended facility supports our commercial paper program and has a million letter of credit sublimit 
letters of credit issued pursuant to the amended facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms 
borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the amended facility 
the amended facility contains certain restrictive covenants  which include maintenance of a debt leverage ratio as defined by the amended facility 
we were in compliance with those covenants at february  thirteen banking institutions are participating in the amended facility 
there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the amended facility and no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program at february  we have a canadian dollar c denominated credit facility in the amount of c million that provides revolving credit support for our canadian operations 
this uncommitted credit facility provides us with the ability to make unsecured borrowings  which are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the credit facility 
as of february   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
in  our board of directors approved a change in the financial metric we use to determine our available debt capacity from time to time 
at february   our available debt capacity was billion  which compared to debt outstanding at that date of billion 
we plan to issue additional debt during and expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include repurchases of shares of our common stock  capital expenditures  repayment of long term debt maturities  acquisitions  other strategic initiatives and working capital needs 
the amount and timing of any additional debt issuances in will depend upon not only our financial performance and estimated available debt capacity at the time  but also upon macroeconomic and debt capital market conditions during the year 
we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short and long term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long term debt 
the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected  however  by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios 
the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard poor s s p and moody s as of april   which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds 
although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings  our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
debt ratings s p moody s commercial paper a p senior debt a a outlook negative stable we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements  but also for our expansion plans  investments in our existing stores  investments in information technology  repurchases of shares of common stock and acquisitions  if any  over the next months 
there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price 
in addition  we do not have a significant amount of cash held in foreign affiliates 
cash requirements capital expenditures our fiscal capital budget is approximately billion  inclusive of approximately million of lease commitments  resulting in a planned net cash outflow of billion 
approximately of the planned net cash outflow is for investments to enhance the customer experience  inclusive of enhancements in information technology 
existing stores account for approximately of planned net cash outflow including investments in resets and remerchandising 
in addition  approximately of the planned net cash outflow is for store expansion 
our expansion plans for consist of approximately new stores and are expected to increase sales floor square footage slightly 
all of the projects are expected to be owned  which includes approximately of the stores on leased land 
other planned capital expenditures include investing in our distribution network  a part of which is the addition of one regional distribution center 
during  we entered into a joint venture agreement with australian retailer woolworths limited  to develop a chain of home improvement stores in australia 
as of february   we had contributed approximately million 
the venture opened its first seven stores under the name masterstm in  and expects to open to stores in debt and capital in november  we issued billion of unsecured notes  in two tranches million of notes maturing in november and million of notes maturing in november net proceeds from the and notes were million and million  respectively 
net proceeds were available for general corporate purposes  including repurchases of shares of our common stock  capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital needs 
dividends declared during fiscal totaled million 
our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the subsequent quarter to their declaration 
dividends declared in the fourth quarter of were paid in fiscal and totaled million 
we have a share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time in the open market or through private transactions 
shares purchased under the share repurchase program are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status 
on august   the company s board of directors authorized a new billion share repurchase program with no expiration 
as of february   we had a remaining repurchase authorization of billion 
we expect to utilize the remaining authorization by the end of fiscal the ratio of debt to equity plus debt was and as of february   and january   respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements other than in connection with executing operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet financing that has  or is reasonably likely to have  a material  current or future effect on our financial condition  cash flows  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at february  payments due by period contractual obligations less than after in millions total year years years years long term debt principal and interest amounts  excluding discount capitalized lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations amounts do not include taxes  common area maintenance  insurance or contingent rent because these amounts have historically been insignificant 
represents commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs  and purchases of merchandise inventory 
at february   our reserve for uncertain tax positions including penalties and interest  net of amounts held on deposit by taxing authorities  was million  of which million was classified as a current liability and million was classified as a noncurrent liability 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
at february   the company had no significant commercial commitments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this form k requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable  all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory description we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost 
this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels  sales trends and historical experience 
during  our reserve increased approximately million to million as of february  we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories 
this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories 
during  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately million to million as of february  in addition  we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business  principally as a result of purchase volumes  sales  early payments or promotions of vendors products  which generally do not represent the reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor s product 
we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued  and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term  and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions 
however  changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves 
likewise  changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary  based on the timing and results of physical inventories 
we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of non productive inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 
for vendor funds  we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place 
due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements  we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year  adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded 
amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes  especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years 
we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves 
a change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for a change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory 
however  substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year 
adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 
long lived asset impairment description we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
when evaluating locations for impairment  our asset group is at an individual location level  as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 
we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location s asset carrying values may not be recoverable 
for operating locations  our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results 
management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment  including individual locations execution of their operating plans and local market conditions  including incursion  which is the opening of either other lowe s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market 
we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location  management makes assumptions  incorporating local market conditions  about key store variables including sales growth rates  gross margin and controllable expenses  such as store payroll and occupancy expense  as well as asset residual values or lease rates 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations  which requires discounting projected future cash flows 
this involves making assumptions regarding both a location s future cash flows  as described above  and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows 
we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows 
the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 
we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure 
this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated 
the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred  including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows  including estimated sales  margin and controllable expenses  and assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure 
we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values  including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions during  operating locations and locations identified for closure experienced a triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability 
four of the operating locations and all of the locations identified for closure were determined to be impaired 
we recorded impairment losses related to operating locations and locations identified for closure of million during  compared to million during we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years 
if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values  our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 
eight of the operating locations that experienced a triggering event during were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired 
for seven of these locations  the expected undiscounted cash flows substantially exceeded the net book value of the location s assets 
a reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows at the latest date that these eight operating locations were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of one of these locations and increased recognized impairment losses by approximately million 
we analyzed other assumptions made in estimating the future cash flows of the operating locations evaluated for impairment  but the sensitivity of those assumptions was not significant to the estimates 
all of the locations identified for closure during were determined to be impaired 
for these locations  a reduction in the estimated selling prices for owned locations  or the present value of estimated cash inflows from sublease activity for leased locations  at the dates that the locations were evaluated for impairment would have increased recognized impairment losses by approximately million 
store closing lease obligations description when locations under operating leases are closed  we recognize a liability for the fair value of future contractual obligations associated with the leased location 
the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payments  property taxes  utilities  common area maintenance and other ongoing expenses  net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable items  discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate 
the expected present value cash flow model uses a probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flows to certain scenarios based on the expected likelihood of outcomes 
estimating the fair value involves making assumptions regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated 
the information includes comparable lease rates of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for leasing these assets 
subsequent changes to the liability  including a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows  are recognized in the period of the change 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our store closing lease liability calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows  primarily related to estimated sublease income  and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions during  stores under operating lease were closed  which includes one store that was relocated 
we recorded million of expense for store closing lease obligations during these charges included million related to new liabilities recorded during and million of adjustments related to previously recorded liabilities 
we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flows of closed locations under operating leases during the past three fiscal years 
if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in estimating expected future cash flows  our store closing lease obligation losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated losses 
a decrease in the estimated present value of cash inflows from sublease activity for the stores under operating lease that closed during would have increased expenses recorded for lease obligations by approximately million 
self insurance description we are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  automobile  property  general and product liability  extended protection plan  and certain medical and dental claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience 
during  our self insurance liability increased approximately million to million as of february  judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment  utilized discount rate  projected exposures including payroll  sales and vehicle units  as well as the frequency  lag and severity of claims 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal years 
although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self insurance liabilities 
a change in our self insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately million for a basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately million for revenue recognition description see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 
we sell separately priced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe s branded program for which the company is ultimately self insured 
the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straight line basis over the respective contract term 
extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer s warranty  as applicable 
the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses 
a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts 
deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts increased million to million as of february  we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed 
revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received 
we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions 
during  deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased million to million as of february  judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate for extended protection plans  there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts 
there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 
for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed  there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years 
we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts 
although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses under the extended protection plan contracts  it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates 
in addition  if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straight line basis  the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change 
a change in the amount of revenue recognized in under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately million 
we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed 
we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may incur additional income or expense 
a change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately million in disclosure regarding forward looking statements we speak throughout this annual report on form k in forward looking statements about our future  but particularly in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the words believe  expect  will  should  and other similar expressions are intended to identify those forward looking statements 
while we believe our expectations are reasonable  they are not guarantees of future performance 
our actual results could differ substantially from our expectations 
for a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to  you should read the risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k to the united states securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or  in the case of any document incorporated by reference  the date of that document 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in the risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events  circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we are exposed to certain market risks  including changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our long term debt is carried at amortized cost and consists of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for financial instruments 
commodity price risk we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control 
we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices 
the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced  in part  by the market price we pay  which is determined by industry supply and demand 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have international operating entities  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and results of operations
