item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
background we are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification  development and commercialization of novel therapies that improve neurological function in people with ms  spinal cord injury  sci  and other disorders of the nervous system 
ampyra general ampyra was approved by the fda in january for the improvement of walking in people with ms 
to our knowledge  ampyra is the first and only product approved for this indication 
efficacy was shown in people with all four major types of ms relapsing remitting  secondary progressive  progressive relapsing and primary progressive 
ampyra was made commercially available in the united states in march net revenue for ampyra was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  approximately of all eligible ms patients have tried ampyra since the launch 
as of december   approximately of all people with ms who were prescribed ampyra received a first refill  and approximately of all people with ms who were prescribed ampyra received a sixth refill 
compliance rates for ampyra are approximately  with patients currently taking an average of tablets per day  compared to the approved dosing of tablets per day 

table of contents ampyra is marketed in the united states through our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure 
we currently have approximately sales representatives in the field calling on a priority target list of approximately  physicians 
we also have established teams of regional scientific managers  regional reimbursement directors  and managed markets account managers who provide information and assistance to payers and physicians on ampyra 
pursuant to our rems approved by the fda  ampyra is distributed in the united states exclusively through a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients by mail  kaiser permanente  which distributes ampyra to patients through a closed network of on site pharmacies  and amerisource specialty distribution healthcare  which is the exclusive specialty pharmacy distributor for the us department of veterans affairs  or va 
all of these customers are contractually obligated to hold no more than days of inventory 
we have contracted with a third party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run ampyra patient support services  or apss  a dedicated resource that coordinates the prescription process among healthcare providers  people with ms  and insurance carriers 
processing of most incoming requests for prescriptions by apss begins within hours of receipt 
patients will experience a range of times to receive their first shipment based on the processing time for insurance requirements 
as with any prescription product  patients who are members of benefit plans that have restrictive prior authorizations may experience delays in receiving their prescription 
as of december   approximately of commercially insured individuals had no or limited prior authorizations  or pas  for ampyra 
we define limited pas as those that require only an ms diagnosis  documentation of no contraindications  and or simple documentation that the patient has walking impairment  such documentation may include a timed foot walk tw test 
as of december   approximately of commercially insured individuals were subject to more restrictive pas  which may include requirements for multiple timed walk tests and or expanded disability status scale score requirements to initiate therapy 
such restricted pas may also include requirements of objective measures of ambulation improvement to reauthorize ampyra therapy 
we estimate that  as of december   approximately of commercially insured individuals were blocked from receiving reimbursement for ampyra 
access figures were calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by commercial healthcare plans 
as of august   three of the largest national health plans in the us aetna  united healthcare and cigna listed ampyra in the lowest branded co pay tier of their commercial preferred drug list or formulary 
license and collaboration agreement with biogen idec in july  biogen idec received conditional approval from the european commission for fampyra  which triggered a million milestone payment to us under our license and collaboration agreement with biogen idec 
pursuant to our worldwide license and supply agreement with elan which has been transferred to alkermes in connection with alkermes acquisition of elan s drug technologies business  we directed of this milestone payment to elan 
to date  biogen idec has launched fampyra in germany  the united kingdom  denmark  norway and iceland 
launch in most of the remaining eu countries is expected by the end of also  in may  fampyra was approved for use in australia by the australian therapeutic goods administration  and has been launched there 
in november  biogen received approval from the new zealand medicines and medical devices safety authority medsafe  and in february biogen idec received approval from health canada 
biogen idec plans to submit regulatory filings for fampyra in more than countries in the next expected milestone payment would be million  due when ex us net sales exceed million over four consecutive quarters 
ampyra development programs we believe there is potential for ampyra to be applied to other indications within ms and also in other neurological conditions 
for example  in december  we initiated a phase proof of concept clinical study 
table of contents of dalfampridine in adults with cerebral palsy 
also  we plan to begin a phase proof of concept trial of dalfampridine in chronic stroke in the second half of this study is expected to enroll patients who have experienced a stroke and who have stabilized with chronic neurologic deficits  which may include walking impairment and arm weakness 
over the first few months following a stroke  patients typically show some degree of spontaneous recovery of function  which may be enhanced by rehabilitation and physical therapy 
this trial will target motor impairments that remain after such recovery 
we also are providing grants for investigator initiated studies looking for potential benefits on a range of functional deficits in ms and other neurological disorders 
patent update related to ampyra on august   the uspto issued the company s patent application no 
 as us patent no 
us  entitled sustained release aminopyridine composition 
the claims of the patent relate to methods to improve walking in patients with ms by administering mg of sustained release aminopyridine dalfampridine twice daily 
the patent  which is eligible for listing in the fda orange book  will extend into with final patent restoration 
on august   we announced that the united states patent and trademark office  or uspto  had allowed us patent application no 
 entitled method of using sustained release aminopyridine compositions 
the claims of the patent application relate to methods to improve walking  walking speed  lower extremity muscle tone and lower extremity muscle strength in patients with ms by administering mg of sustained release aminopyridine dalfampridine twice daily 
the patent that issues from this application  which will be eligible for listing in the fda orange book  is expected to expire in plus any additional term determined by the final patent term adjustment calculation by the uspto  which may extend the term of the patent into the european patent office  or epo  issued a corresponding patent in june zanaflex zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets are fda approved as short acting drugs for the management of spasticity  a symptom of many cns disorders  including ms and sci 
these products contain tizanidine hydrochloride  one of the two leading drugs used to treat spasticity 
we launched zanaflex capsules in april as part of our strategy to build a commercial platform for the potential market launch of ampyra 
combined net revenue of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the commercial launch of generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules in february by apotex and potentially others  including our own authorized generic product being marketed by watson pharma  will likely cause the company s net revenue from zanaflex capsules to decline significantly in and beyond 
the company believes that the intangible assets associated with zanaflex capsules are now fully impaired based on estimated undiscounted cash flows and associated fair value of this asset 
we made this decision based on a september ruling by the us district court for the district of new jersey in litigation with apotex that our patent relating to zanaflex capsules is invalid as not enabled refer to item of this report for more information on this litigation 
for the three month period ended september   the company recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million to write off the remaining carrying value of this asset 
in connection with the outcome of the apotex litigation  during the three month period ended september   the company also recorded a loss on our put call liability resulting from a change in its fair market value of million related to the prf revenue interest agreement as well as an inventory reserve of approximately million consisting of a million charge for commercial inventory and a  charge for sample inventory 
as of december   there have been no accruals for loss contingencies aside from payments related to the litigation itself 
other internal research programs we have three ongoing research and development programs focused on novel approaches to limit and repair damage to components of the cns neuregulins  remyelinating antibodies and chondroitinase 
we believe 
table of contents that these programs have broad applicability and have the potential to be first in class therapies 
while our existing programs have been focused on ms and sci  we believe they may be applicable across a number of cns disorders  including stroke and tbi  because many of the mechanisms of tissue damage and repair are similar 
in addition  we believe that some of our research and development programs may have applicability beyond the nervous system  including in the field of cardiology 
glial growth factor we are conducting a phase clinical trial of ggf in heart failure patients and expect to announce preliminary trial results in the second half of if we are able to establish a proof of concept for treatment of heart failure through human clinical studies  we may decide to develop the product independently or to enter into a partnership  most likely with a cardiovascular focused company 
remyelinating antibodies we expect to file an ind for one of the remyelinating antibodies  rhigm  for the treatment of ms in the first half of and expect to begin a phase clinical trial by the end of in preparation for the ind filing  we worked with a contract manufacturer to complete the scale up manufacturing and purification processes and completed formal preclinical safety and toxicity studies 
the manufacturing data  clinical plans and preclinical safety profile will be subject to fda review as part of our ind filing 
chondroitinase program we are continuing research  which has been funded in part by federal and state grants  on the potential use of chondroitinases for the treatment of injuries to the brain and spinal cord  as well as other neurotraumatic indications 
the chondroitinase program is in the research and translational development phase and has not yet entered formal preclinical development 
we are exploring the possibility of obtaining additional research grants from the national institutes of health  or nih  as well as potential partnerships with other companies to support our efforts 
acquisition from medtronic of ac in june  we entered into a license agreement with medtronic  inc and one of its affiliates  pursuant to which we acquired worldwide development and commercialization rights to certain formulations of magnesium with a polymer such as polyethylene glycol which we refer to as ac 
pursuant to the license agreement  we paid medtronic an upfront fee of million and are obligated to pay up to an additional million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and development milestones 
if we commercialize ac  we will also be obligated to pay a single digit royalty on sales 
we plan to study ac as an acute treatment for patients who have suffered neurological trauma  such as sci and tbi 
we expect to begin enrollment in a phase clinical trial in patients with acute sci in the second half of ardsley lease in june  we entered into a year lease for an aggregate of approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space in ardsley  new york 
base rent will initially be million per year  subject to a annual increase 
we have options to extend the lease term for three additional five year periods  and may terminate the lease after years  subject to payment of an early termination fee 
we also have the right to lease up to approximately  additional square feet of space in additional buildings at the same location 
we anticipate taking possession of the new space in june  subject to completion of certain improvements that must be finished prior to our occupancy 

table of contents outlook for financial guidance for we are providing the following guidance with respect to our financial performance 
the following does not reflect any potential expenditures related to the neuronex transaction described below 
we expect net revenue from the sale of ampyra to range from million to million 
we expect combined net revenues from sales of zanaflex capsules including from sales of authorized generic tizanidine hydrochloride under our agreement with watson pharma and zanaflex tablets  and royalty revenue from sales by biogen idec of fampyra outside the us  of at least million 
research and development expenses are expected to range from million to million  excluding share based compensation charges 
these expenses will include post marketing studies for ampyra  phase proof of concept studies in cerebral palsy and chronic stroke  and sponsorship of investigator initiated studies of ampyra 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to range from million to million  excluding share based compensation charges 
the principal factors affecting sg a will be commercial and administrative costs related to ampyra 
we expect to be cash flow positive in the range of sg a and r d expenditures for are non gaap financial measures because they exclude share based compensation charges 
non gaap financial measures are not an alternative for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  we believe the presentation of these non gaap financial measures  when viewed in conjunction with actual gaap results  provides investors with a more meaningful understanding of our projected operating performance because they exclude non cash charges that are substantially dependent on changes in the market price of our common stock 
we believe that non gaap financial measures that exclude share based compensation charges help indicate underlying trends in our business  and are important in comparing current results with prior period results and understanding expected operating performance 
also  our management uses non gaap financial measures that exclude share based compensation charges to establish budgets and operational goals  and to manage our business and to evaluate its performance

our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of revenue generated from sales of ampyra and zanaflex capsules  the continued progress of our research and development activities  the amount and timing of milestone or other payments payable under collaboration  license and acquisition agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or in license new products and compounds including the development costs relating to those products or compounds 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future operating requirements we will need to raise additional capital  reduce planned expenditures  or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
if we require additional financing in the future  we cannot assure you that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
financing arrangements in january  elan international services  ltd 
eis loaned us an aggregate of million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes to partly fund our research and development activities 
on december   elan transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with saints capital 
as of december   million of these promissory notes was outstanding  which amount includes accrued interest 
the first of seven annual payments on this note were due and paid on the one year anniversary after ampyra approval on january  and will continue to be paid annually until paid in full 
on december   we entered into a revenue interest assignment agreement with prf  a dedicated healthcare investment fund  pursuant to which we assigned to prf the right to a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
to secure our obligations to prf  we also granted prf a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to zanaflex 
our agreement with prf covers all zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interest assignment agreement with prf 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november an additional million was due to us if net revenues during the fiscal year equaled or exceeded million 
this milestone was met and the receivable was reflected in our december  financial statements 
under the terms of the amendment  we repaid prf million on december  and an additional million on december  since the net revenues milestone was met 

table of contents under the agreement and the amendment  prf is entitled to the following portion of zanaflex net revenues with respect to zanaflex net revenues up to and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million but less than and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  and with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues 
notwithstanding the foregoing  once prf has received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  prf will only be entitled to of zanaflex net revenues 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a liability as of december   referred to as the revenue interest liability  of approximately million 
we impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method and record a corresponding accrued interest liability 
the effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the life of the arrangement 
the interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors  including the level of zanaflex sales 
we currently estimate that the imputed interest rate associated with this liability will be approximately 
payments made to prf as a result of zanaflex sales levels will reduce the accrued interest liability and the principal amount of the revenue interest liability 
upon the occurrence of certain events  including if we experience a change of control  undergo certain bankruptcy events  transfer any of our interests in zanaflex other than pursuant to a license agreement  development  commercialization  co promotion  collaboration  partnering or similar agreement  transfer all or substantially all of our assets  or breach certain of the covenants  representations or warranties we make under the agreement  prf may i require us to repurchase the rights we sold them at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or ii foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf 
except in the case of certain bankruptcy events  if prf exercises its right  which we refer to as prf s put option  to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it  prf may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put call price as required 
if we experience a change of control we have the right  which we refer to as our call option  to repurchase the rights we sold to prf at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised 
the put call price on a given date is the greater of i all payments made by prf to us as of such date  less all payments received by prf from us as of such date  and ii an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to prf of on all payments made by prf to us as of such date  taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by prf from us as of such date 
we have determined that prf s put option and our call option meet the criteria to be considered an embedded derivative and should be accounted for as such 
therefore  we recorded a net liability of million as of december  related to the put call option to reflect its current estimated fair value 
this liability is revalued on an as needed basis to reflect any changes in the fair value and any gain or loss resulting from the revaluation is recorded in earnings 
during any period during which prf has the right to receive of zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement  then of the first million in payments from zanaflex sales we receive from wholesalers will be distributed to prf on a daily basis 
following the end of each fiscal quarter  if the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter exceeds the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive  prf will remit such excess to us 
if the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive during such quarter exceeds the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter  we will remit such excess to prf 
investment activities at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time 
table of contents deposits and investments in a treasury money market fund and high quality government bonds 
also  we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  as compared to million as of december  our short term investments consist of us treasury bonds with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year 
the balance of these investments was million as of december   as compared to million as of december  net cash provided by used in operations net cash provided by used in operations was million and million for year ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to net income of million principally resulting from a milestone revenue payment from biogen idec  a non cash share based compensation expense of million  an asset impairment charge of million  a decrease in inventory held by the company of million  amortization of net premiums and discounts on short term investments of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease in the noncurrent portion of deferred cost of license revenue of  and a  loss on our put call liability 
cash provided by operations was partially offset by a net decrease of million due to changes in working capital items primarily due to the payment of accruals and prepaid items during the year ended december  the offset to cash provided by operations was also attributable to a decrease in deferred license revenue of million due to the amortization of the upfront collaboration payment received during the three month period ended september  and an increase in accounts receivable of  cash used in operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory held by the company of million due to the purchase of ampyra launch stock and additional ampyra inventory to meet demand which was launched in  an increase in accounts receivable of million resulting from an increase in gross product sales for ampyra which was launched in  a net loss of million  and a decrease in the non current portion of deferred license revenue of million due to the amortization of the upfront collaboration payment received during the three month period ended september  cash used in operations for the year ended december  also included a net increase of million due to changes in other working capital items 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a non cash share based compensation expense of million  amortization of net premiums and discounts on short term investments of million  and depreciation and amortization of million 
net cash used in investing net used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to million in purchases of short term investments  purchases of intangible assets of million  and purchases of property and equipment of million partially offset by million in proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options partially offset by million in repayments to prf 
contractual obligations and commitments our long term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
under certain supply agreements and other agreements with manufacturers and suppliers  we are required to make payments for the manufacture and supply of our clinical and approved products 
our major outstanding contractual obligations are for payments related to our convertible notes  our facility leases and our commitments to purchase inventory 
the following table summarizes our minimum 
table of contents significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years convertible note payable operating leases inventory purchase commitments total excludes prf principal and interest payments  due to uncertainty as to the amount and timing of such payments 
represents the remaining annual payments of principal and interest to be made on the convertible note payable to saints capital 
represents payments for hawthorne  ny lease through june  then for ardsley  ny lease thereafter 
represents zanaflex and ampyra inventory commitments 
the ampyra inventory commitment is an estimate as the price paid for ampyra inventory is based on a percentage of the net product sales during the quarter alkermes ships inventory to us 
under our supply agreement with alkermes  we provide alkermes with monthly written month forecasts  and with annual written five year forecasts for our supply requirements of ampyra and two year forecasts for our supply requirements of zanaflex capsules 
in each of the five months for zanaflex and three months for ampyra following the submission of our written month forecast we are obligated to purchase the quantity specified in the forecast  even if our actual requirements are greater or less 
we have agreed to purchase at least of our annual requirements of ampyra from alkermes  unless alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet its requirements  for a percentage of net product sales and the quantity of product shipped by alkermes to us 
under certain license agreements  we are required to pay royalties for the use of technologies and products in our r d activities and in the commercialization of products 
the amount and timing of any of the foregoing payments are not known due to the uncertainty surrounding the successful research  development and commercialization of the products 
under certain license agreements  we are also required to pay license fees and milestones for the use of technologies and products in our r d activities and in the commercialization of products 
we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately million as part of our various collaborations  including licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december   such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements 
amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development  regulatory and commercial milestones 
there is uncertainty regarding the various activities and outcomes needed to reach these milestones  and they may not be achieved 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  primarily employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this document 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition ampyra ampyra is available in the us only through a network of specialty pharmacy providers that provide the medication to patients by mail  kaiser permanente kaiser  which distributes ampyra to patients through a closed network of on site pharmacies  and amerisource specialty distribution healthcare  which is the exclusive specialty pharmacy distributor for the us department of veterans affairs va 
we do not recognize revenue from product sales until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  the company has no obligation to bring about the sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize product sales of ampyra following shipment of product to these customers 
our customers are contractually obligated to hold no more than days of inventory 
our net revenues represent total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated rebates  discounts and returns 
these allowances are recorded for cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer that is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  are characterized as a reduction of revenue 
at the time product is shipped to our customers  an adjustment is recorded for estimated chargebacks  rebates  and returns 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
in determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
allowances for rebates  discounts and returns are established based on the contractual terms with customers  communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  as well as expectations about the market for each product and anticipated introduction of competitive products 
product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
based on the data that we receive from our customers  and returns experience of other specialty products with similar selling models  we have been able to make a reasonable estimate for product returns 
we will accept returns of ampyra for two months prior to and six months after its expiration date but  once our product is prescribed  it cannot be returned 
we will provide a credit to our customers for returned products but we do not exchange product from inventory for the returned product 
zanaflex we apply the revenue recognition guidance in accounting standards codification asc  which among other criteria requires that future returns can be reasonably estimated in order to recognize revenue 
we have accumulated some sales history with zanaflex capsules  however  due to existing and potential generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we cannot reasonably determine a return rate at this time and  thus  are not permitted to recognize revenue based on shipments to wholesalers 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
we continue to accumulate data and when we are able to reasonably estimate product returns based on this data and 
table of contents based on greater certainty regarding generic competition we will then begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue following shipment of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory held by the wholesaler as a component of inventory 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
when we receive the prescription data  we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
in addition to the prescription data we purchase  we also receive data that we use to monitor trends in sales from wholesalers to their customers 
we receive this data from an outside vendor on a monthly basis 
this data includes the number of bottles shipped from certain wholesalers to their customers 
we also compare our shipments to wholesalers to prescription reports to further assess inventory in the distribution channel on a monthly basis 
we use the wholesaler sales trend data and the wholesaler vs 
prescription comparison to better understand market conditions  but not as a basis for recognizing revenue 
we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives to our wholesalers and our policy is not to ship in excess of our wholesalers inventory levels maintained in the ordinary course of business 
our net revenues represent total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  rebates  and chargebacks 
these allowances are recorded for cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer that is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of income 
adjustments are recorded for estimated chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for chargebacks  rebates and discounts are established based on the contractual terms with customers  analysis of historical levels of discounts  chargebacks and rebates  communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  as well as expectations about the market for each product and anticipated introduction of competitive products 
product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
we accept returns of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets for six months prior to and twelve months after their expiration date 
we provide a credit to customers with whom we have a direct relationship or a cash payment to those with whom we do not have a direct relationship 
we do not exchange product from inventory for the returned product 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
in addition  we record a charge to cost of goods sold for the cost basis of the estimated product returns we believe may ultimately be realized at the time of product shipment to wholesalers 
we recognize this charge at the date of shipment since it is probable that we will receive a level of returned products  upon the return of such product we will be unable to resell the product considering its expiration dating  and  we can reasonably estimate a range of returns 
this charge represents the cost basis for the low end of the range of the company s estimated returns 
the charge to cost of goods sold amounted to million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a change in this expense estimate would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s cost of sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we initiated a product recall for three lots of zanaflex capsules in february due to two reports of empty zanaflex capsules that had been distributed to pharmacies and sold to patients 
returns of this recalled product are being charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
some shipments of zanaflex capsules during the twelve month period ended december  were likely to replace this recalled product 
as of december  we received approximately million in recall returns which was charged directly against deferred revenue 
under the terms of our agreement with 
table of contents alkermes  they are responsible for the cost of replacing the inventory and any reasonable and actual costs and expenses that we incur in connection with the recall 
discounts and allowances reserves for ampyra and zanaflex with respect to customer credits  including estimated rebates  wholesaler fees for services  discounts and returns  have been established 
discounts and allowances are recorded following shipment of product and the appropriate reserves are credited 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate of historical experience and data points available and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for customer credits  rebates  wholesaler fees for services  and discounts are established based on contractual terms with customers and analyses of historical usage of these items 
the nature of the company s allowances and accruals requiring critical estimates  and the specific considerations it uses in estimating their amounts are as follows government chargebacks and rebates the company contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply schedule which commits us to providing those agencies with our most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for chargebacks and rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the chargebacks and rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent chargebacks and rebate experience 
the company s chargebacks and rebate accruals were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the company s chargebacks and rebate allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
managed care contract rebates the company contracts with various managed care organizations including health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers in order to provide improved access to ampyra for patients that are members of such organizations 
these contracts stipulate that rebates and  in some cases  administrative fees  are paid to these organizations provided ampyra is represented as a specific tier on the organizations drug formulary 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through managed care channels  we provide an allowance for managed care contract rebates 
we began to enter into these contracts during the three months ended december  we continue to monitor the sales trends and adjust the allowance on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the company s managed care contract rebate accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the company s managed care contract rebate allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
copay mitigation rebates the company offers copay mitigation to commercially insured patients who have coverage for ampyra and do not reside in states excluded from receiving copay mitigation and are responsible for a cost share regardless of financial need income status 
the copay mitigation program is intended to reduce the patient s financial responsibility for ampyra to a specified dollar amount 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to actual copay assistance provided  we provide an allowance for copay mitigation rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the company s copay mitigation rebate accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the company s managed care contract rebate allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 

table of contents cash discounts the company sells ampyra directly to its network of specialty pharmacies  kaiser and the specialty distributor to the us department of veterans affairs va and zanaflex directly to wholesalers and generally provides invoice discounts for prompt payment 
the company estimates its cash discounts based on the terms offered to its customers 
discounts are accrued based on historical usage rates at the time of product shipment 
we adjust accruals based on actual activity as necessary 
cash discounts are typically settled with wholesalers within days after the end of each calendar month 
the company s cash discounts and allowances accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the company s cash discounts and allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
product returns our specialty pharmacies have the right to return any unopened product during the eight month period beginning two months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending six months after the labeled expiration date 
once product has been prescribed  it is no longer eligible for return 
when specialty pharmacies return product  they will be given a credit against amounts owed 
the company does not replace returned product with new product 
as of the year ended december   the company has not received any product returns of ampyra 
ampyra has been granted orphan drug status  meaning that the product should not be subject to generic competitors for at least seven years post approval 
while we do not have the benefit of our own historical data for a product similar to ampyra  we compared reserve rates employed by companies with similar selling models or products ie other specialty pharmaceutical products 
based on the our specialty distribution model sales to only a limited number of specialty pharmacies  kaiser  and the specialty distributor to the va  the data we receive from our specialty pharmacies  the returns experience of other specialty products with similar selling models and the fact that the specialty pharmacies  kaiser  and the specialty distributor to the va have contractually agreed to hold no more than days worth of product stock  we expect the returns rate for ampyra will be low  similar to other specialty distribution models 
we consider the past buying patterns our specialty pharmacies  kaiser  and the specialty distributor to the va  the estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped  the expiration dates of product currently being shipped  our own price changes and those of competitive products  and introductions of generic products as applicable to determine our return rate 
the company s returns accrual was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the company s returns allowance would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we record zanaflex capsule and tablet revenue based on a deferred revenue model and recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned 
therefore  there is no returns reserve for zanaflex 
data fees and fees for service payable to wholesalers the company has contracted with the specialty pharmacies not including the specialty distributor to the va to obtain transactional data related to ampyra in order to ascertain a better understanding of our selling channel as well as patient activity and utilization by the medicaid program and other government agencies and managed care organizations 
these contracts stipulate that the specialty pharmacies provide data directly to the company  as well as indirectly through ampyra patient support services apss  which in turn provides data to the company 
a data fee is paid by the company to the specialty pharmacies for each line of data provided and the company provides an allowance for these data fees 
a line of data is defined as data pertaining to a single prescription 
the company pays a fee for service to certain wholesalers on contractually determined rates for distribution  inventory management and data reporting services 
the company estimates its fee for service accruals and allowances based on sales to each wholesaler and the applicable contracted rate 
the company s fee for service expenses are accrued at the time of product shipment and are typically settled with the wholesalers within days after the end of each respective quarter 
the company s data fee and fee for service accruals were  and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the company s data fee and fee for service 
table of contents allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s net revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has adjusted its allowances in the past based on actual experience  and the company will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances and accruals in the future 
the historical adjustments have not been significant to operations 
the company continually monitors its allowances and accruals and makes adjustments when the company believes actual experience may differ from its estimates 
the allowances included in the table below reflect these adjustments 
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to the company s sales discounts and allowances during  and in thousands government chargebacks and rebates managed care contract rebates copay mitigation rebates cash discounts product returns data fees and fees for services payable to wholesalers total balance at december  allowances for sales allowances for prior year sales actual credits for sales during actual credits for prior year sales balance at december  allowances for sales allowances for prior year sales actual credits for sales during actual credits for prior year sales balance at december  allowances for sales allowances for prior year sales actual credits for sales during actual credits for prior year sales balance at december  collaborations we recognize collaboration revenues by analyzing each element of the agreement to determine if it shall be accounted for as a separate element or single unit of accounting 
if an element shall be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes  the revenue recognition principles most appropriate for that element are applied to determine when revenue shall be recognized 
if an element shall not be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes  the revenue recognition principles most appropriate for the bundled group of elements are applied to determine when revenue shall be recognized 
payments received in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
milestones and royalties in order to determine the revenue recognition for contingent milestones  the company evaluates the contingent milestones using the criteria as provided by the financial accounting standards boards fasb guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition 
at the inception of a collaboration agreement the company evaluates if payments are substantive 
the criteria requires that i the company determines if the milestone is commensurate with either its performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value resulting from the company s activities to achieve the milestone  ii the milestone be related to past performance  and iii the milestone be reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement 
if these criteria are met then the contingent milestones can be considered as substantive milestones and will be recognized as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of various research and collaboration agreements 

table of contents license revenue and cost of license revenue under the collaboration agreement with biogen idec  we were entitled to a non refundable upfront payment of million as of june   the date of the agreement  which was received on july  as a result of such payment to us  million became payable by us to elan under our existing agreements with elan 
these agreements obligate us to pay an amount equal to of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to ampyra or other aminopyridine products 
as of december  we estimated the revenue recognition period for the upfront payment that we received from biogen idec  and for any milestone payments made to us by biogen idec  and for the corresponding payments that we make to elan  to be approximately years 
ampyra inventory prior to regulatory approval of ampyra in the three month period ended march   the company incurred expenses for the manufacture of several batches of ampyra that ultimately became available to support the commercial launch of this drug candidate 
until the necessary initial regulatory approval was received  we charged all such amounts to research and development expenses 
as a result  our initial sales of ampyra resulted in higher gross margins than if the inventory costs had not previously been expensed 
upon regulatory approval of ampyra  the company began capitalizing the commercial inventory costs associated with manufacturing with alkermes plc alkermes  formerly elan corporate  plc elan  and at its second manufacturer  patheon 
during the third quarter of  alkermes acquired the elan business that supplies our ampyra inventory 
the cost of ampyra inventory manufactured by alkermes is based on specified prices calculated as a percentage of net product sales of the product shipped by alkermes to acorda 
in the event alkermes does not manufacture the products  alkermes is entitled to a compensating payment for the quantities of product provided by the alternative manufacturer 
this compensating payment is included in our inventory balances 
cost of sales ampyra cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves when necessary  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the company s agreement with alkermes and well as the capitalization of a milestone achievement with the canadian spinal research organization csro during the three months ended march   packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
the company s inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into with alkermes 
these agreements require us to pay alkermes a percentage of our net selling price for each inventory lot purchased from alkermes 
the cost for each lot is calculated based on an agreed upon estimated net selling price which is based on an actual net selling price pertaining to a prior quarter 
at the end of each quarter  the company performs a calculation to adjust the inventory value for any lots received in the current quarter to that quarter s actual net selling price 
this payment is recorded as an adjustment to inventory as well as an accrual on the company s balance sheet and is required to be paid within days of the quarter end 
in the event the company has sold any inventory purchased from alkermes during that respective quarter  the company would also record an adjustment to the cost of goods sold and an additional accrual on the balance sheet to be paid to alkermes 
the agreement with alkermes allows the company to purchase up to of its annual inventory requirements from an alternative manufacturer but stipulates a compensating payment to be made to alkermes for any inventory purchased from this alternative manufacturer 
this payment is determined at the end of the quarter in which any new lots have been purchased exclusive from alkermes using the actual net selling price for the respective quarter net of an agreed upon amount as stipulated by the alkermes agreement 
this payment is recorded as an adjustment to inventory as well as an accrual on the company s balance sheet 

table of contents zanaflex cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves when necessary  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the zanaflex acquisition  intangible write off expense when necessary  packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
our inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into in connection with our zanaflex acquisition 
any payments we make to prf in connection with the revenue interest assignment transaction entered into in december will not constitute royalty expense or otherwise affect our cost of sales 
see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities including  employee compensation and benefits  occupancy costs  and research and development conducted for us by third parties  such as contract research organizations cros  sponsored university based research  clinical trial vendors  contract manufacturing for our preclinical program  costs of materials used in clinical trials  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products and regulatory consulting to support our products 
in addition  research and development expenses include expenses related to grant revenue and the cost of clinical trial drug supply shipped to our clinical study vendors 
for those studies that we administer ourselves  we account for our clinical study costs by estimating the patient cost per visit in each clinical trial and recognizing this cost as visits occur  beginning when the patient enrolls in the trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial  and the length of the treatment period for each patient 
for those studies for which we use a cro  we account for our clinical study costs according to the terms of the cro contract 
these costs include upfront  milestone and monthly expenses as well as reimbursement for pass through costs 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accrual  such changes in estimate may be a material change in our clinical study accrual  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred except when we are accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
in these cases  these payments are capitalized at the time of payment and expensed ratable over the period the research and development activity is performed 
we have three ongoing research and development programs neuregulins  remyelinating antibodies and chondroitinase focused on novel approaches to limit and repair damage to components of the cns 
a clinical trial is ongoing for our lead product candidate for our neuregulins program  ggf we plan to file an ind for our lead antibody in our remyelinating antibody program  rhigm  in the first half of  and to begin a phase clinical trial by the end of the year 
our chondroitinase program is still in the research phase 
in addition  in  we in licensed a clinical stage program  ac  to develop an acute treatment for neurological trauma 
we consider the active management and development of our research  preclinical and clinical pipeline an important component of the long term process of introducing new products 
we manage our overall research  development and in licensing efforts in a highly disciplined manner designed to advance only high quality  differentiated agents into clinical development 
the duration of each phase of research and preclinical and clinical development and the probabilities of success for approval of drug candidates entering clinical development will be impacted by a variety of factors  including the quality of the molecule  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition and commercial viability 
due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and the early stage nature of our pipeline development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty completion dates  the proportion of our r d investments assigned to any one program or to the future cash inflows from these potential programs 
with respect to previously established clinical study accruals in prior periods and for the twelve month period ended december  we did not make any significant adjustments to our clinical study costs 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  related benefits and share based compensation for our sales  managed markets and marketing personnel and the cost of ampyra and zanaflex sales and marketing initiatives 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  related benefits and share based compensation for personnel serving executive  finance  medical affairs  safety  business development  legal  quality assurance  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development or sales and marketing expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
other income expense interest income consists of income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense consists of interest expense related to our revenue interest liability and accrued interest on our convertible notes 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recorded a million provision for income taxes for the year ended december  we did not record any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december  or we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards cannot be sufficiently assured at december  as of december   we had available federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which may be available to offset future taxable income  if any 
the federal losses are expected to expire between and while the state losses are expected to expire between and we also have research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  through since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and may incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  the code  provides for a limitation of the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the code that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the code  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
share based compensation we account for stock options and restricted stock granted to employees and non employees by recognizing the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions in the financial statements at their fair 
table of contents values 
we estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form option pricing model based on assumptions for the expected term of the stock options  expected volatility of our common stock  prevailing interest rates  and an estimated forfeiture rate 
we have based our current assumptions on the following assumption method of estimating estimated expected term of options historical term of our options expected volatility combination of historic volatility of our common stock since october  and the historic volatility of the stock of our peer companies risk free interest rate yields of us treasury securities corresponding with the expected life of option grants forfeiture rates historical forfeiture data of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of the employees and expected performance of our common stock 
increases in the term and the volatility of our common stock will generally cause an increase in compensation expense 
as we acquire more historical data for our stock s volatility over the expected term of the options  we will weight our stock s volatility heavier versus our peers in the expected volatility assumption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  grants receivable  convertible notes payable  accounts payable  and put call liability 
the estimated fair values of all of our financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts at december  we have cash equivalents and short term investments at december   which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as our interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds and us treasury bonds  the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximate their fair value at december  at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which had an average interest rate of approximately 
we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity and to meet operating needs 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments
