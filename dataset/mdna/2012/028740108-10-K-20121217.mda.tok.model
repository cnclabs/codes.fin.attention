our company american pacific corporation and its predecessors have been engaged in chemical manufacturing since we are a leading custom manufacturer of fine chemicals and specialty chemicals within our focused markets 
through our fine chemicals segment  we supply active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and registered intermediates to the pharmaceutical industry 
our specialty chemicals segment produces various perchlorate chemicals and is the only north american producer of ammonium perchlorate ap  which is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in space exploration  commercial satellite transportation and national defense programs 
we produce clean agent chemicals for the fire protection industry  as well as electro chemical equipment for the water treatment industry 
our products are designed to meet customer specifications and often must meet certain governmental and regulatory approvals 
our technical and manufacturing expertise and customer service focus has gained us a reputation for quality  reliability  technical performance and innovation 
given the critical nature of our products  we maintain long standing strategic customer relationships and generally sell our products through long term contracts under which we are the sole source or limited source supplier 
our business segments our continuing operations comprise three reportable business segments fine chemicals  specialty chemicals  and other businesses 
the following table reflects the revenue contribution percentage from our business segments and each of their major product lines for the fiscal years ended september fine chemicals specialty chemicals perchlorates sodium azide halotron total specialty chemicals other businesses real estate water treatment equipment total other businesses total revenues less than fine chemicals 
our fine chemicals segment  operated through our wholly owned subsidiaries ampac fine chemicals llc and ampac fine chemicals texas  llc collectively afc  is a custom manufacturer of apis and registered intermediates for customers in the pharmaceutical industry 
the pharmaceutical ingredients we manufacture are used by our customers in drugs with indications in three primary areas anti viral  oncology  and central nervous system 
afc s customers include some of the world s largest pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as emerging pharmaceutical companies 
most of the products afc sells are proprietary to our customers and used in existing drugs that are fda approved and commercially available 
we operate in compliance with the us food and drug administration s the fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp and the requirements of certain other regulatory agencies such as the european union s european medicines agency and japan s pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency 
our fine chemicals segment s strategy is to focus on high growth markets where our technological position  combined with our chemical process development and engineering expertise  leads to strong customer allegiances and limited competition 
we have distinctive competencies and specialized engineering capabilities in performing chiral separations  manufacturing products that require high containment and performing energetic chemistries at commercial scale 
we have recently expanded our technology offering to include commercial scale production of schedule ii to v controlled substances in our high security facilities in rancho cordova  california 
we have invested significant resources in our facilities  workforce and technology base 
we believe we are the us leader in performing chiral separations using smb technology and own and operate two large scale smb systems  both of which are among the largest in the world operating under cgmp 
we offer a full range of smb equipment and related services from laboratory scale to our large systems 
we believe our distinctive competency in manufacturing chemical compounds that require specialized high containment facilities and handling expertise provide us a significant competitive advantage in competing for various opportunities associated with high potency  highly toxic and cytotoxic products 
many oncology drugs are made with apis that are high potency or cytotoxic 
afc is one of the few companies in the world that can manufacture such compounds at a multi ton annual rate 
moreover  our significant experience and highly engineered facilities make us one of the few companies in the world with the capability to use energetic chemistry on a commercial scale under cgmp 
we use this capability in development and production of products such as those used in anti viral drugs  including hiv related and influenza combating drugs 
we have established long term  and in some cases sole source contracts with customers that represent the majority of our revenues 
contracts that are not sole source are limited source considering the nature of our industry and the products we manufacture 
the inherent nature of custom pharmaceutical fine chemicals manufacturing encourages stable  long term customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop reliable  safe and cost effective  custom solutions 
once a custom manufacturer has been qualified as a supplier on a cgmp product  there are several potential barriers that discourage transferring the manufacturing of the product to an alternative supplier 
for example  applications to and approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities generally require the chemical contractor to be named 
switching contractors may require additional regulatory approvals and could take as long as two years to complete 
switching contractors and amending various filings can result in significant costs associated with technology transfer  process validation and re filing with the fda and other regulatory authorities around the world 
specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals segment is principally engaged in the production of perchlorates  which include several grades of ammonium perchlorate ap  sodium perchlorate and potassium perchlorate 
ap is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in national defense  space exploration and commercial satellite transportation programs 
we have supplied rocket grade ap for use in space and defense programs for over years and we have been the only rocket grade ap supplier in north america since  when we acquired the ap business of our principal competitor  kerr mcgee chemical corporation 
ap is a key component of solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles that are utilized in us department of defense dod tactical and strategic missile programs  as well as various space programs such as the delta and atlas families of commercial space launch vehicles and space exploration programs for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa 
there is currently no domestic alternative to these solid rocket motors 
as a result  we believe that the us government views us as a strategic national asset 
alliant techsystems inc or atk is a significant ap customer 
we sell rocket grade ap to atk under a long term contract that requires us to maintain a ready and qualified capacity for rocket grade ap and that requires atk to purchase its rocket grade ap requirements from us  subject to certain terms and conditions 
the contract  which expires in  provides fixed pricing in the form of a price volume matrix for annual rocket grade ap volumes ranging from million to million pounds 
pricing varies inversely to volume and includes annual escalations 
in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  a chemical primarily used in pharmaceutical manufacturing  and halotron  a series of clean fire extinguishing agents used in fire extinguishing products ranging from portable fire extinguishers to total flooding systems 
other businesses 
our other businesses segment contains our water treatment equipment division and real estate activities 
our water treatment equipment business markets  designs  and manufactures electrochemical on site hypochlorite generation  or oshg systems 
these systems are used in the disinfection of drinking water  control of noxious odors  and the treatment of seawater to prevent the growth of marine organisms in cooling systems 
we supply our equipment to municipal  industrial and offshore customers 
our real estate activities are not material 
discontinued operations 
in may  our board of directors approved and we committed to a plan to sell our aerospace equipment segment  which is comprised of ampac isp corp 
and its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries ampac isp 
we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of ampac isp effective august  the divestiture is a strategic shift that allows us to place more focus on the growth and performance of our pharmaceutical related product lines 
revenues and expenses associated with the operations of ampac isp are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented

environmental remediation charges 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recorded environmental remediation charges of and  respectively  reflecting increases in our total cost estimate of probable costs for our henderson  nevada groundwater remediation operations 
see detailed discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
other operating gains 
during fiscal and fiscal  our fine chemicals segment reported other operating gains of  and  respectively  that resulted from the resolution of gain contingencies 
the reported gains are comprised of the following two matters 
our fine chemicals segment is undertaking several mandatory capital projects 
certain of the capital activities are complete and others are in progress or otherwise expected to be completed during fiscal in connection with these projects  our fine chemicals segment held  and continues to hold  negotiations with the former owner of the facilities 
during fiscal and fiscal  we received from the former owner cash consideration in the amount of  and  respectively  for a limited release of liability of the former owner with respect to one of the completed projects 
we made a series of filings with the county of sacramento  california  to appeal the assessed values in prior years of our real and personal property located at our fine chemicals segment s rancho cordova  california facility 
during fiscal  we received  for cash property tax refunds resulting from our appeals and the related favorable reassessment of historical property values

interest expense was consistent between fiscal  fiscal and fiscal because the interest rate for our then outstanding debt was fixed 
on august   we called  of the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes 
on september  we completed the redemption  using net cash proceeds from the sale of ampac isp and available cash balances 
the redemption price for the notes was of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the transaction resulted in a net loss on debt retirement of  which includes the call premium of  unamortized debt issuances costs of and other expenses of see further discussion below under the heading long term debt and credit facilities 
income taxes 
our income tax expense benefit rate for continuing operations differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes  amounts that were expensed for book purposes that are not deductible for income tax purposes  changes in our valuation allowances  and other adjustments to our estimates of tax liabilities 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax benefit rate for continuing operations is as follows for the years ended september federal income tax at the statutory rate state income tax  net of federal benefit nondeductible expenses valuation allowance interest and penalties other effective tax rate deferred tax assets are comprised of the following at september deferred tax assets pension obligations environmental remediation reserves inventory accrued expenses deferred gain on sale of business intangible assets tax credits and carryforwards other subtotal valuation allowance deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities property  plant and equipment prepaid expenses other deferred tax liabilities net deferred tax assets deferred tax assets arise primarily because expenses have been recorded in historical financial statement periods which will not become deductible for income taxes until future tax years 
we record valuation allowances to reduce the book value of our deferred tax assets to amounts that are estimated to be more likely than not realized 
this assessment requires judgment and is performed on the basis of the weight of all available evidence  both positive and negative  with greater weight placed on information that is objectively verifiable such as historical performance 
for fiscal  we evaluated negative evidence noting that for the three year period then ended  we reported a cumulative net loss 
pursuant to fasb guidance  a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that must be considered and this form of negative evidence is difficult to overcome without sufficient objectively verifiable positive evidence 
our then objectively verifiable positive evidence included certain aspects of our historical results 
additional positive evidence includes forecasts of future taxable income 
however  since this latter form of evidence was not objectively verifiable  its weight is not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence 
as a result of this evaluation  we increased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by  as of september  of this amount   was recorded as income tax expense and  was charged to other comprehensive loss offsetting deferred tax assets that were generated in the current year 
for fiscal  we reported significant income before tax from continuing operations which resulted in cumulative earnings for the three year period then ended 
we evaluated the current facts and circumstances and concluded that the negative evidence that existed as of september   no longer existed 
accordingly  we relied on positive evidence  which included taxable income in the current year  a forecast of significant taxable income in coming years and the absence of credit carry forward balances 
as a result  we reversed the valuation allowance of  of this amount   increased other comprehensive income and  was recorded as an income tax benefit for continuing operations 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on having sufficient taxable income in the future years when the tax deductions associated with the deferred tax assets become deductible 
the establishment or reversal of a valuation allowance  if any  does not impact cash nor does it preclude us from using our tax credits  loss carryforwards and other deferred assets in the future 
discontinued operations 
in may  our board of directors approved and we committed to a plan to sell our aerospace equipment segment  or ampac isp 
the divestiture is a strategic shift that allows us to place more focus on the growth and performance of our pharmaceutical related product lines 
on june   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with moog inc moog the asset purchase agreement  pursuant to which we sold to moog substantially all of the assets of the ampac isp corp  including all of the equity interests in its foreign subsidiaries collectively  the purchased assets 
additionally  moog assumed certain liabilities related to the operations and the purchased assets 
the transaction was completed effective august  under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the total consideration was approximately  the purchase price in cash 
in addition   of the purchase price the escrow amount will be held in an escrow account for months following the closing of the transaction the escrow period and applied towards our indemnification obligations in favor of moog  if any 
the asset purchase agreement provides that we  subject to certain limitations  indemnify moog for damages and losses incurred or suffered by moog as a result of  among other things  breaches of our respective representations  warranties and covenants contained in the asset purchase agreement as well as any of the liabilities that we retain 
the balance of the escrow amount remaining at the end of the escrow period shall be released to us 
we have accounted for the escrow amount as a contingent gain  and accordingly have deferred recognition of the amount until all contingencies have lapsed or been resolved 
revenues and expenses associated with the operations of ampac isp are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
summarized financial information for ampac isp is as follows year ended september  revenues discontinued operations operating income loss before tax income tax provision benefit net income loss from discontinued operations gain loss on sale fo discontinued operations gain on sale of discontinued operations before tax income tax provision benefit net gain on sale of discontinued operations business segment results fine chemicals segment year ended september  revenues operating income loss operating margin as discussed above under the heading other operating gains  our fine chemicals segment operating income loss for fiscal and fiscal includes other gains of  and  respectively

year ended september  adjustments for other operating gains operating income loss  as reported exclude other operating gains segment operating income loss  as adjusted operating margin  as adjusted revenues 
fine chemicals segment revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  led by strong anti viral product revenues 
compared to fiscal  anti viral products revenues increased for fiscal anti viral products revenues in the fiscal periods were at reduced levels due to a gap between production campaigns for a particular product 
production of this product resumed in early calendar under a renewed three year agreement resulting in a significant increase in anti viral products revenues in fiscal revenues from our central nervous system cns products increased compared to fiscal reflecting improved pricing and favorable volumes 
during fiscal we renewed the production contract for the primary group of products within this therapeutic indication 
the new contract has a five year term  favorable pricing as compared to the prior contract  and contains minimum purchase requirements for our customer 
the increases in anti viral and cns products revenues were offset somewhat by lower oncology products revenues 
during the later part of fiscal  we began to recognize revenue from the commercial production of three new products with oncology indications 
the introduction of new commercial products is an important achievement for this segment 
nonetheless  the fiscal initial revenues for these new products did not fully replace revenue declines from our legacy oncology product 
our legacy oncology product is an active pharmaceutical ingredient for a drug facing generic competition and  as a result  is experiencing volume and related revenue declines 
we anticipate volume for these new products  and products currently considered development products  to grow and replace or exceed revenues from mature oncology products in the coming years 
the introduction of these new products into our commercial product lines is an example of how our emphasis on our pipeline of development products can result in a successful replacement cycle for maturing products 
development products are products which are not yet commercialized  and products which are commercial but for which we are not a current commercial producer 
development product revenues were approximately  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal the small variance in revenues reflects project timing 
typically  development product activities are the source of developing new long term customer relationships and often lead to future core products 
the products categorized as development products are used by our customers primarily for drugs with indications in anti viral  cns  oncology and pain management 
fine chemicals segment revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from oncology and cns products increased and  respectively 
we experienced a gap in production for our most significant anti viral product that impacted the later part of fiscal and the early part of fiscal since both fiscal periods were affected  anti viral product revenues were consistent between fiscal and fiscal sales of this anti viral product  under a renewed three year supply agreement  began in the fiscal third quarter 
the increase in oncology revenues is largely due to timing shifts from fiscal into fiscal  driven by customer inventory levels and production line availability 
the increase in cns revenue is largely due to one customer s timing of its product demand 
revenues from development products continue to become an increasing component of fine chemicals segment revenues  exceeding of fine chemicals segment revenues in fiscal growth in this area has resulted from an intensified focus on core technologies and diversification of products and customers 
operating income loss 
the fine chemicals segment returned to profitability during fiscal  reporting adjusted operating income of  compared to an adjusted operating loss of  in fiscal fine chemicals segment gross margin improved by points in fiscal as compared to fiscal our fine chemicals segment has dedicated significant efforts over the last two years to improving the efficiency of its manufacturing activities 
redesigned key processes are now yielding targeted throughput rates 
other efficiencies and cost savings initiatives  such as solvent recycling  have been implemented 
these actions  along with improved overhead absorption due to the higher production volumes  have resulted in increased gross margin for all major product categories in our fine chemicals segment 
improvements in gross profit for fiscal periods were offset by increases in general and administrative expenses of approximately  the higher general and administrative expenses include approximately  of incentive compensation which is based on the segment s improved performance 
incentive compensation was zero in fiscal and fiscal also includes higher insurance and retirement benefits related expenses 
for fiscal  the fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage declined five points compared to the prior fiscal year 
the primary reason for the decline in gross margin was continued difficulties with implementation of a process improvement that was intended to offset reduced pricing on a core product and extended equipment maintenance 
these difficulties contributed to below target through put rates and material reprocessing 
fine chemicals segment operating expenses in fiscal were reduced by  reflecting property tax and insurance savings 
backlog 
agreements with our fine chemicals segment customers typically include multi year supply agreements 
these agreements may contain provisional order volumes  minimum order quantities  take or pay provisions  termination fees and other customary terms and conditions  which we do not include in our computation of backlog 
fine chemicals segment backlog includes unfulfilled firm purchase orders received from a customer  including both purchase orders which are issued against a related supply agreement and stand alone purchase orders 
fine chemicals segment backlog was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we anticipate order backlog as of september  to be substantially filled during fiscal outlook 
the pharmaceutical markets we target are expected to continue to be driven by strong demand for products that use our core technologies  including anti viral and oncology drugs  many of which are expected to benefit from the use of energetic chemistry or require high containment or other unique engineering expertise 
since a growing percentage of future drugs are anticipated to be based on chirally pure material  we believe our investment in smb technology may prove to be a strong  long term competitive advantage for us 
we believe there is a continuing trend toward more outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry  especially for pharmaceutical ingredients that require specialized equipment or technologies  such as smb or high containment manufacturing  and chemicals that are sensitive from a proprietary standpoint 
in addition  we have recently seen examples of customer outsourcing trends shifting back to chemical suppliers in the us and western europe from asian suppliers 
as discussed above  afc s pipeline of development products continues to grow and diversify  reflecting this trend 
we are targeting of revenues as an average  long term goal for sales of development products 
fine chemicals segment revenues are anticipated to increase in fiscal by a range of approximately to compared to fiscal  supported by expected growth in revenues from development products and new core products that were introduced in fiscal specialty chemicals segment year ended september  revenues operating income loss operating margin revenues 
specialty chemicals segment revenues include revenues from our perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron product lines  with perchlorates comprising  and of specialty chemicals revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the year over year variances in specialty chemicals revenues reflect the following factors a decrease in perchlorate volume offset by a increase in the related average price per pound for fiscal an decrease in perchlorate volume offset by a increase in the related average price per pound for fiscal sodium azide revenues increased in fiscal and in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
halotron revenues decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in total perchlorate volume for fiscal is primarily due to a decline in volume for our lower priced  non rocket grade perchlorates 
rocket grade ap volume increased in fiscal  supported by the return in fiscal of quantities for development motors for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa heavy lift vehicle which is part of the new space launch system 
tactical and strategic missile related demand remained stable 
the increase in the average price per pound for fiscal is a result of a change in product mix 
the fiscal periods include a smaller volume of our lower priced perchlorate products 
the average price per pound of rocket grade perchlorate was consistent between the fiscal and fiscal periods 
in addition  rocket grade ap revenues are typically derived from relatively few large orders 
as a result  quarterly revenue amounts can vary significantly depending on the timing of individual orders throughout the year 
average price per pound may continue to fluctuate somewhat in future periods  depending upon product mix and volume 
the decrease in total perchlorate volume for fiscal is primarily due to limited demand for rocket grade ap for usage on space programs 
tactical and strategic missile program demand continued to be stable and accounted for the largest component of rocket grade ap volume in fiscal the ares program was the largest component of volume in fiscal the decline in rocket grade ap demand was offset by an increase in volume for our other perchlorate products  which was approximately higher in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in the average price per pound of perchlorates in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects two offsetting factors 
the average price per pound of rocket grade ap increased approximately proportionate and inverse to the decrease in rocket grade ap volume consistent with the contractual rocket grade ap price volume matrix  under which price and volume move inversely  and comparable catalog pricing 
this increase was partially offset because revenues from our other lower value perchlorate products  such as sodium perchlorate and potassium perchlorate  accounted for a substantially greater percentage of all perchlorate product volume in fiscal this has the effect of reducing the average unit price for perchlorates 
the changes in sodium azide revenues in fiscal and fiscal are due primarily to fluctuation in demand for sodium azide used in pharmaceutical applications 
we do not anticipate a significant increase in demand for sodium azide in fiscal changes in halotron revenues have been driven by volume changes which have been and are expected to be relatively consistent year over year 
operating income loss 
specialty chemicals segment reported operating income of  and operating margin of for fiscal the operating margin declined in fiscal when compared to the atypically high operating margin generated in fiscal fiscal product mix reflects a more typical mix of re determinable and firm fixed price orders 
as a result  gross margin declined three percentage points from fiscal specialty chemicals segment operating expenses were consistent between fiscal and fiscal specialty chemicals segment profits for fiscal were atypically high compared to profits generated in fiscal years with a more traditional mix of product revenues 
gross margin increased two percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a much larger percentage of firm fixed price ap sales orders compared to re determinably priced sales orders in the fiscal year  while  the opposite was true in fiscal firm fixed price orders carry more profit risk because of potential sales volume volatility  but also provide the potential of higher margins when the volatility works in our favor 
secondary reasons for the gross margin increase in fiscal include increased sales of multi purpose perchlorates and recycled perchlorates compared to the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  specialty chemicals segment achieved operating expenses savings of approximately reflecting primarily lower insurance and professional services costs 
backlog 
specialty chemicals segment backlog includes unfulfilled firm purchase orders received from a customer  including both purchase orders which are issued against long term supply agreements and stand alone purchase orders 
specialty chemicals segment backlog was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we anticipate order backlog as of september  to be substantially filled during fiscal specialty chemicals product orders are typically characterized by individually large orders which at various times during the fiscal year 
this usually results in a backlog and revenue pattern which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
specialty chemicals segment backlog as of september   is atypically high relative to its annual sales volume 
outlook 
specialty chemicals segment revenues are expected to increase in fiscal by approximately 
this segment is currently performing under several non recurring development projects that should contribute to the expected revenue increase in fiscal the core products for this segment are expected to continue to perform within their historical stable range 
while the us government budgeting process will affect the total demand for rocket grade ap  we expect steady demand within the range of million to million pounds per year 
further  we expect that unit pricing will continue to vary inversely to volume 
our pricing structure is designed to absorb our substantial fixed manufacturing costs regardless of our annual production volume 
as a result  we forecast that this segment will continue to achieve stable annual revenues  without significant growth opportunities 
this forecasted range of production volume contemplates the current annual high and low scenarios for both dod and nasa programs over the next five years  including tactical and strategic missile programs  military and commercial space launch programs  and nasa s sls 
sls is developing the hlv 
the current baseline configuration for hlv uses two solid rocket boosters  similar to  but larger than  the retired space shuttle reusable solid rocket motor 
hence  this will demand the use of rocket grade ap 
during the development phase of approximately four years  the demand should be one to two million pounds per year 
in the launch phase after development  the demand for rocket grade ap from hlv should be more significant 
while there is still potential to shift to liquid boosters in the future  once the new solid rocket boosters are developed  we believe there will be no advantage to switching to a different technology 
the most predictable and steady use of ap is expected to be in the dod applications 
the need for tactical rockets and strategic missiles is anticipated to provide the base demand over the coming five year period and beyond 
other businesses segment year ended september  revenues operating loss operating margin other businesses segment revenues include pepcon systems water treatment equipment and related spare parts sales and real estate revenues 
the increase in revenues for fiscal reflects a increase in equipment sales and an increase in spare parts sales 
from time to time  spare parts sales include an infrequent large order  which was the cause of the increase in fiscal equipment sales decreased  in fiscal compared to fiscal the variances in equipment sales were driven by the timing of new system shipments 
the operating loss was reduced in fiscal the magnitude of cost overruns to complete equipment orders was not as large in fiscal due to improvements in order execution 
corporate expenses year ended september  corporate expenses corporate operating expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  largely due to increases in board of directors and shareholder matter related costs 
in fiscal  corporate operating expenses were reduced by  compared to fiscal cost reduction activities generated savings of  primarily in the areas of travel and professional services  which were offset somewhat by increases in board of director expenses

cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of changes in exchange rates on cash nm nm net change in cash for period nm not meaningful operating activities fiscal compared to fiscal operating activities provided cash of  for fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year  resulting in a decrease of significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include an increase in cash due to an improvement in cash profits generated by our continuing operations 
a decrease in cash provided by working capital accounts of approximately  excluding the effects of interest and income taxes 
a decrease in cash taxes refunded of approximately  an increase in cash used for environmental remediation of approximately an increase in cash used to fund pension obligations of  an increase in cash paid for debt extinguishment costs of approximately other increases in cash provided by operating activities  primarily discontinued operations  of approximately  the decrease in cash provided by working capital accounts relates primarily to changes in customer deposits 
in march  the specialty chemicals segment received an atypically high customer deposit that resulted from favorable contract terms 
this did not recur in fiscal remaining variances in working capital are within our customary ranges  including an increase in fine chemicals segment inventory at september  during fiscal  we received income tax refunds from federal income tax carryback claims 
this did not recur in fiscal  resulting in a decrease in income tax refunds when comparing the periods 
during fiscal we spent  for remediation activities compared to  in fiscal the increase reflects cash used for the capital elements of the henderson  nevada  expansion project 
see detailed discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
during fiscal and fiscal  we made payments to fund defined benefit pension obligations at of the obligation 
in fiscal  the company contribution needed to meet this funding level increased because the return on pension plan assets in the preceding year was not sufficient to maintain our target funding requirements 
cash used by discontinued operations working capital accounts decreased because these operations did not experience the same working capital requirements in fiscal prior to their divestiture as they experienced in fiscal we consider the working capital changes to be routine and within the normal production cycle of our products 
the production of most fine chemical products requires a length of time that exceeds one quarter 
in any given quarter  accounts receivable  work in progress inventory or deferred revenues and customer deposits can increase or decrease significantly 
we expect that our working capital may vary normally by as much as  from quarter to quarter 
fiscal compared to fiscal operating activities provided cash of  for fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include an increase in cash due to an improvement in cash profits generated by our operations 
an increase in cash used for working capital accounts of  excluding the effects of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash income taxes refunded of  a decrease in cash paid for interest of an increase in cash used for environmental remediation of an increase in cash used to fund pension obligations of  other increases in cash provided by operating activities of the increase in cash used for working capital accounts includes several primary components 
cash provided by specialty chemicals segment working capital accounts increased approximately  specialty chemicals segment accounts receivable balances were unusually high at september  collection of these balances in fiscal generated improvement in cash flow 
cash used by fine chemicals segment working capital accounts increased by approximately  consistent with the growth in business in fiscal cash used by discontinued operations working capital accounts increased by approximately  in part due to business growth and in part because certain active contracts had less favorable billing terms than was typical for this business 
the increase in cash income taxes refunded is a result of federal income tax carryback claims that were filed and collected during fiscal the increase in cash used for environmental remediation relates to the henderson  nevada  expansion project 
see detailed discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
cash used to fund pension obligations increased because the return on pension plan assets alone was not sufficient to maintain the minimum funding requirements 
investing activities fiscal compared to fiscal capital expenditures of  for fiscal reflect a decrease from fiscal of  during fiscal  our fine chemicals segment required less investment in capital equipment associated with new products and contracts 
maintenance capital spending was consistent between fiscal and fiscal we are anticipating our capital expenditures  which do not include environmental remediation spending  for fiscal to range from approximately  to approximately  during fiscal we plan to make investments to expand our mid range production capacity for our fine chemicals segment 
as discussed above under the heading discontinued operations  effective on august   we sold our aerospace equipment segment 
total consideration was  of which  will be held in an escrow account for months following the close of the transaction 
after reducing the total consideration by the amount placed in escrow  cash sold with the foreign entities  and transaction expenses  the net proceeds to us during fiscal were  fiscal compared to fiscal capital expenditures of  for fiscal are consistent with capital expenditure levels in fiscal the capital expenditures relate to our fine chemicals segment  in particular  additional equipment to support a new three year core product agreement for the supply of anti viral products and facilities improvements to enhance quality compliance 
financing activities fiscal compared to fiscal on august   we called  of the outstanding principal amount of our senior notes defined below

the purchase price was  which approximated the carrying value of the notes  net of deferred financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources 
as of september   we had cash of  our primary source of working capital is cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
in october  we called and terminated our senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of  and replaced the notes with a credit facility that includes a  term loan and a  revolving credit line 
funds used to call the notes of  were provided by the net proceeds from the term loan and available cash balances 
the revolving credit line  which was undrawn at inception  provides a committed revolving credit line  up to a maximum of  for further discussion  see below under the heading long term debt and credit facilities 
the term loan requires quarterly principal and interest payments  which differs from the senior notes which had no principal amortization requirements 
we do not anticipate that the principal payment requirements of the new facility will have a significant impact on our liquidity because we expect that the cash requirements for principal payments will be substantially offset by lower interest expense 
we believe that changes in cash flow from operations during our fiscal periods reflect short term timing and as such do not represent significant changes in our sources and uses of cash 
because our revenues  and related customer invoices and collections  are characterized by relatively few individually significant transactions  our working capital balances can vary normally by as much as  from period to period 
we may incur additional debt to fund capital projects  strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes  subject to our existing leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by our lenders 
the availability of our cash inflows is affected by the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for our products 
from time to time  we may explore options to refinance our borrowings 
the timing of our cash outflows is affected by payments and expenses related to the manufacture of our products  capital projects  pension funding  interest on our debt obligations and environmental remediation or other contingencies  which may place demands on our short term liquidity 
although we are not currently party to any material pending legal proceedings  we are from time to time subject to claims and lawsuits related to our business operations and we have incurred legal and other costs as a result of litigation and other contingencies 
we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods  and  to the extent not covered by insurance  they may adversely affect our liquidity 
in contemplating the adequacy of our liquidity and available capital  we consider factors such as current results of operations  cash flows and backlog  anticipated changes in operating trends  including anticipated changes in revenues and margins  cash requirements related to our debt agreements and pension plans  and cash requirements related to our remediation activities 
we do not currently anticipate that the factors noted above will have material effects on our ability to meet our future liquidity requirements 
we continue to believe that our cash flows from operations  existing cash balances and existing or future debt arrangements will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations on both a short term and long term basis 
long term debt and credit facilities senior notes 
in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of senior notes due february  the senior notes 
the senior notes accrued interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually in february and august 
the senior notes were guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our existing and future material us subsidiaries 
in june  we repurchased and cancelled  in principal amount of our senior notes for  as a result of this repurchase  we recorded an immaterial loss of in other income expense  net of deferred financing costs of on august   we called  of the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes 
on september  we completed the redemption  using net cash proceeds from the sale of ampac isp and available cash balances 
the redemption price for the notes was of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the transaction resulted in a net loss on debt retirement of  which includes the call premium of  unamortized debt issuances costs of and other expenses of in connection with our entering into the credit facility as defined below  on october   a notice of redemption was issued for all remaining outstanding senior notes specifying a redemption date of november  the redemption price for the notes was of the outstanding principal amount of  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but not including  the redemption date 
on october   we irrevocably deposited funds with the trustee in an amount equal to the redemption price for the senior notes and the related indenture was discharged 
this transaction will result in a net loss on debt retirement  including the call premium of  which will be recorded in the three month period ending december  abl credit facility 
on january   american pacific corporation  as borrower  entered into an asset based lending credit agreement the abl credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  as agent and as lender  and certain domestic subsidiaries of the company  as guarantors  which provided a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to  at any time outstanding with an initial maturity of days prior to the maturity date of the senior notes  which is february  the maximum borrowing availability under the abl credit facility was based upon a percentage of our eligible account receivables and eligible inventories 
on september   under the abl credit facility  we had no outstanding borrowings and were not subject to compliance with the financial covenants 
on october   we terminated the abl credit facility 
credit facility 
on october   we entered into an  senior secured credit agreement the credit facility by and among american pacific corporation  the lenders party thereto the lenders and keybank national association  as the swing line lender  issuer of letters of credit under the credit facility and as the administrative agent of the lenders 
under the credit facility  we i obtained a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of  with an initial maturity in years the term loan  and ii may obtain revolving loans of up to  in aggregate principal amount  of which up to  may be outstanding in connection with the issuance of letters of credit the revolving facility 
there were no amounts drawn upon the revolving facility upon issuance 
we may prepay and terminate the credit facility at any time  without premium or penalty 
the credit facility contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions which are based upon certain asset sales  equity issuances  incurrence of certain indebtedness and events of loss 
for any borrowings under the credit facility  we elect between two options to determine the annual interest rates applicable to loans under the credit facility base rate loans and eurodollar loans 
these elections can be renewed or changed from time to time during the term of the credit facility 
the interest rate for an election period is determined as the base rate or the adjusted eurodollar rate each as defined in the credit facility  and in each case  plus an applicable margin  which shall range from to for base rate loans or from to for eurodollar loans  subject to adjustment based on the leverage ratio 
interest payments are due at least quarterly and may be more frequent under certain eurodollar loan elections 
the term loan includes quarterly principal amortization payments which will commence on december  scheduled amortization of the term loan is     and  for each of the five years in the period ending september   respectively 
the remaining balance of the term loan of  is due upon maturity 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our current and future domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our current and future domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the credit facility 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends  repurchase our stock  or make other restricted payments  make certain investments or acquisitions  incur additional indebtedness  create or permit to exist certain liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  consummate a merger  consolidation or sale of assets  change our business  and wind up  liquidate  or dissolve our affairs 
in each case  the covenants set forth above are subject to customary and negotiated exceptions and exclusions 
the credit facility includes two financial covenants that are measured quarterly 
leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio must be less than or equal to to 
the credit facility defines the leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated total debt as of the last day of a quarter test date to consolidated ebitda for the four consecutive quarters preceding the test date  each as defined in the credit facility 
debt service coverage ratio 
the debt service coverage ratio must be at least to  with increases to to for the period commencing september  to september   and increasing to to for the period commencing september  and thereafter 
the credit facility defines the debt service coverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated ebitda minus consolidated capital expenditures to scheduled repayments plus consolidated adjusted interest expense  each as defined in the credit facility 
with respect to these covenant compliance calculations  consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit facility hereinafter  referred to as credit facility ebitda  differs from typical ebitda calculations and our calculation of adjusted ebitda  which is used in certain of our public releases and in connection with our incentive compensation plan 
the most significant difference in the credit facility ebitda calculation is the inclusion of cash payments for environmental remediation as part of the calculation 
the following statements summarize the elements of those definitions that are material to our computations 
consolidated total debt generally includes principal amounts outstanding under our credit facility  capital leases  drawn amounts for outstanding letters of credit and other indebtedness for borrowed money 
credit facility ebitda is generally computed as consolidated net income loss plus income tax expense benefit  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  and certain non cash charges and less cash payments for environmental remediation  extraordinary gains and certain other non cash gains 
the credit facility also contains usual and customary events of default subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  the company may be required to repay the obligations under the credit facility prior to the credit facility s stated maturity and the related commitments may be terminated 
principal maturities 
as discussed above  in october  we redeemed our outstanding senior notes in the amount of  and entered into a credit facility which includes a term loan in the amount of  funds used to call the notes were provided by the net proceeds from the term loan and available cash balances 
the table below is presented after the effects of our october refinancing activities 
principal maturities for our credit facility and capital leases that were outstanding as of september  are as follows years ending september thereafter total pension benefits 
we maintain three defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all of our employees the amended and restated american pacific corporation defined benefit pension plan  the ampac fine chemicals llc pension plan for salaried employees  and the ampac fine chemicals llc pension plan for bargaining unit employees  each as amended to date 
collectively  these three plans are referred to as the pension plans 
in may  our board of directors approved amendments to our pension plans which effectively closed the pension plans to participation by any new employees 
retirement benefits for existing us employees and retirees through june  were not affected by this change 
beginning july   new us employees began participating solely in one of the company s k plans 
pension plan benefits are paid based on an average of earnings  retirement age  and length of service  among other factors 
benefit obligations are measured annually as of september as of september   the pension plans had an unfunded benefit obligation of  for fiscal  we made contributions to the pension plans in the amount of  we anticipate making pension plan contributions in the amount of approximately  during fiscal we are required to make minimum contributions to our pension plans pursuant to the minimum funding requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and the employee retirement income security act of  as amended 
in accordance with federal requirements  our minimum funding obligations are determined annually based on a measurement date of october the fair value of pension plan assets is a key factor in determining our minimum funding obligations 
holding all other variables constant  a decline in asset value as of september  would increase our minimum funding obligations for fiscal by approximately in addition  we maintain the american pacific corporation supplemental executive retirement plan  as amended and restated the serp  that includes three active and two former executive officers 
the serp is an unfunded plan and as of september  the serp obligation was  for fiscal  we paid serp retirement benefits of we anticipate contributing the amount of approximately to the serp during fiscal for the payment of retirement benefits 
payments for retirement benefits should increase in future years when each of the three current active participants retires 
the future increase in such retirement benefits will be determined based on certain variables including each participating individual s actual retirement date  rate of compensation and years of service 
during fiscal and fiscal  our aggregate pension plans and serp liability increased significantly primarily due to reductions in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate on the obligation  returns on plan assets at levels substantially lower than the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and losses on certain plan assets 
these changes are recorded as an increase in pension obligations and a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if interest rates remain low and or returns on plan assets do not trend with the expected long term rate of return  our liquidity could be impacted by pension plan funding requirements 
environmental remediation ampac henderson site 
during the fiscal years ended september  and september   we recorded aggregate charges for  representing our then estimates of the probable costs of our remediation efforts at our former perchlorate chemicals manufacturing facility in henderson  nevada the ampac henderson site  including the costs for capital equipment and on going operating and maintenance o m 
late in the fiscal year ended september  fiscal  we gained additional information from groundwater modeling that indicates groundwater emanating from the ampac henderson site in certain areas in deeper zones more than feet below ground surface is moving toward our existing remediation facility at a much slower pace than previously estimated 
utilization of our existing facilities alone  at this lower groundwater pace  could  according to this groundwater model  extend the life of our remediation project to well in excess of fifty years 
as a result of this additional data  related model interpretations and consultations with ndep  we re evaluated our remediation operations and determined that we should be able to improve the effectiveness of the treatment program and significantly reduce the total project time by expanding the then existing treatment system 
the expansion includes installation of additional groundwater extraction wells in the deeper  more concentrated areas  construction of an underground pipeline to move extracted groundwater to our treatment facility  and the addition of fluidized bed reactor fbr bioremediation treatment equipment the expansion project that will enhance  and in some cases replace  primary components of the existing treatment system 
in our fiscal fourth quarter  we accrued  as our initial estimate of the capital cost of the expansion project and the related estimates of the effects of the enhanced operations on the on going o m costs and project life 
through june  and in cooperation with ndep  we worked to develop the formal design  engineering and permitting of the expansion project 
based on data obtained through that date  which was largely comprised of firm quotations  we determined that significant modifications to our fiscal assumptions were required 
as a result  in june  we accrued an additional  for the estimated increase in cost of the capital component of the expansion project  offset slightly by reductions in o m cost estimates 
the estimated capital costs of the expansion project increased by approximately  the increase reflects i an increase in the capacity of the fbr bioremediation treatment equipment to accommodate technical requirements based on the testing of new extraction wells in the fall of  and ii higher than initially anticipated cost associated with the installation of the equipment and construction of the pipeline 
our estimate of total o m costs was reduced by approximately in september  we commenced initial operation of the expansion project 
related system optimization and other start up activities will continue into the early months of fiscal in september  we recorded an additional remediation charge in the amount of  which is substantially attributed to the true up of estimates to the expected final cost of the expansion project 
due to uncertainties inherent in making estimates  our estimates of capital and o m costs may later require significant revision as new facts become available and circumstances change 
the estimated life of the project is a key assumption underlying the accrued estimated cost of our remediation activities 
groundwater modeling and other information regarding the characteristics of the surrounding land and demographics indicate that at our targeted processing rate of gallons per minute for the new groundwater extraction wells gallons per minute in the aggregate with existing wells  the life of the project could range from to years from the date that the expansion project is placed in service 
further  the data indicates that within that range  to years is the more likely range 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  if no point within the more likely range is considered more likely than another  then estimates should be based on the low end of the range 
accordingly  our accrued remediation cost includes estimated o m costs through  which is the low end of the likely range of the project life 
groundwater speed  perchlorate concentrations  aquifer characteristics and forecasted groundwater extraction rates will continue to be key factors considered when estimating the life of the project 
if additional information becomes available in the future that leads to a different interpretation of the model  thereby dictating a change in equipment and operations  our estimate of the resulting project life could change significantly 
the estimate of the annual o m cost of the project is a key assumption in our computation of the estimated cost of our remediation activities 
to estimate o m costs  we consider  among other factors  the project scope and historical expense rates to develop assumptions regarding labor  utilities  repairs  maintenance supplies and professional services costs 
we estimate average annual o m costs to be approximately  if additional information becomes available in the future that is different than information currently available to us and thereby leads us to different conclusions  our estimate of o m expenses could change significantly 
in addition  certain remediation activities are conducted on public lands under operating permits 
in general  these permits may require us to relocate our underground pipeline or equipment to accommodate future public utilities and features and require us to return the land to its original condition at the end of the permit period 
if we are required to relocate our underground pipeline or equipment in the future  the costs of such activities would be incremental to our current cost estimates 
estimated costs associated with removal of remediation equipment from the land are not material and are included in our range of estimated costs 
as of september   the aggregate range of anticipated environmental remediation costs was from approximately  to approximately  this range represents a significant estimate and is based on the estimable elements of cost for capital and o m costs  and an estimated remaining operating life of the project through a range from the years to as of september   the accrued amount was  based on an estimated remaining life of the project through the year  or the low end of the more likely range of the expected life of the project 
cost estimates are based on our current assessments of the facility configuration 
as we proceed with the project  we have  and may in the future  become aware of elements of the facility configuration that must be changed to meet the targeted operational requirements 
certain of these changes may result in corresponding cost increases 
costs associated with the changes are accrued when a reasonable alternative  or range of alternatives  is identified and the cost of such alternative is estimable 
our estimated reserve for environmental remediation is based on information currently available to us and may be subject to material adjustment upward or downward in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate 
other arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
operating leases 
we lease our corporate offices under an operating lease that expires in and contains step rent provisions  escalation clauses and also provides for cash allowances toward the funding of capital improvements 
our minimum lease payments include these considerations 
total rental expense for continuing operations under operating leases was   and  for the years ended september    and  respectively 
minimum lease payments are recognized as rental expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
estimated future minimum lease payments under operating leases as of september   are as follows years ending september thereafter total employee agreements 
we have an employment agreement with our chief executive officer 
the term of the employment agreement currently ends on september   unless amended or extended in accordance with the terms of the agreement or otherwise 
significant contract provisions include annual base salary  health care benefits  and non compete provisions 
the employment agreement is primarily an at will employment agreement  under which we may terminate the executive officer s employment for any or no reason 
generally  the agreement provides that a termination without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
we maintain severance agreements with each of our vice president  administration and our chief financial officer  which  generally  provide that a termination of the executive without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
in addition  certain other key divisional executives are eligible for severance benefits 
estimated minimum aggregate severance benefits under all of these agreements and arrangements was approximately  as of september  letters of credit 
as of september   we had in outstanding standby letters of credit which mature through april these letters of credit principally secure performance of certain water treatment equipment sold by us 
the letters of credit are collateralized by cash on deposit with the issuing bank in the amount of of the outstanding letters of credit 
collateral deposits are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
inflation 
generally  inflation did not have a material or significant effect on our sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires that we adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgment  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
sales and revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
almost all products sold by our fine chemicals segment are subject to customer acceptance periods 
specifically  these customers have contractually negotiated acceptance periods from the time they receive certificates of analysis and compliance certificates to reject the material based on issues with the quality of the product  as defined in the applicable agreement 
at times we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance 
if we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance  we record deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenue upon delivery of the product and recognize revenues in the period when the acceptance period lapses or the customer s acceptance has occurred 
some of our perchlorate and fine chemicals products customers have requested that we store materials purchased from us in our facilities bill and hold transactions or arrangements 
we recognize revenue prior to shipment of these bill and hold transactions when we have satisfied the applicable revenue recognition criteria  which include the point at which title and risk of ownership transfer to our customers 
these customers have specifically requested in writing  pursuant to a contract  that we invoice for the finished product and hold the finished product until a later date 
for our bill and hold arrangements that contain customer acceptance periods  we record deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenues when such products are available for delivery and certificates have been delivered to the customers 
we recognize revenue on our bill and hold transactions in the period when the acceptance period lapses or the customer s acceptance has occurred 
the sales value of inventory  subject to bill and hold arrangements  at our facilities was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
depreciable or amortizable lives of long lived assets 
our depreciable or amortizable long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  which are recorded at cost 
depreciation or amortization is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the asset s estimated economic useful life or the lease term  if the asset is subject to a capital lease 
economic useful life is the duration of time that we expect the asset to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
significant assumptions that affect the determination of estimated economic useful life include wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  and changes in market demand for products 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technological advances  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we test our property  plant and equipment for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such circumstances include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets 
to test for recovery  we group assets an asset group in a manner that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
our asset groups are typically identified by facility because each facility has a unique cost overhead and general and administrative expense structure that is supported by cash flows from products produced at the facility 
the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
if we determine that an asset group is not recoverable  then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections would represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
some of the factors that management would consider or estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce and inflation 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we would use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews but cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
when we review asset groups for recoverability  we also consider depreciation estimates and methods or the amortization period  in each case as required by applicable accounting standards 
any revision to the remaining useful life of a long lived asset resulting from that review also is considered in developing estimates of future cash flows used to test the asset group for recoverability 
environmental costs 
we are subject to environmental regulations that relate to our past and current operations 
we record liabilities for environmental remediation costs when our assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review our estimates of future costs that could be incurred for remediation activities 
in some cases  only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated 
in establishing our reserves  the most probable estimate is used  otherwise  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
estimates of liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technologies and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances 
accrued environmental remediation costs include the undiscounted cost of equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and fees to outside law firms and consultants  for the estimated duration of the remediation activity and do not include an assumption for inflation 
estimating environmental cost requires us to exercise substantial judgment regarding the cost  effectiveness and duration of our remediation activities 
actual future expenditures could differ materially from our current estimates 
we evaluate potential claims for recoveries from other parties separately from our estimated liabilities 
we record an asset for expected recoveries when recoveries of the amounts are probable 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  separately for each tax paying entity in each tax jurisdiction  using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
when measuring deferred tax assets  we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established by evaluating both positive and negative factors 
this evaluation requires that we exercise judgment in determining the relative significance of each factor 
a valuation allowance is established if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the assessment of valuation allowance requirements  if any  involves significant estimates regarding the timing and amount of reversal of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we rely on deferred tax liabilities in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets if the temporary timing difference is anticipated to reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and the deferred tax liabilities are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
we weigh both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is required 
greater weight is given to evidence which is objectively verifiable such as historical results 
if we report a cumulative loss from continuing operations before income taxes for a three year period  we do not rely on forecasted improvements in earnings to recover deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with an accounting standard which creates a single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the standard also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under this standard  we may recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue 
the amount recognized is the largest benefit that we believe has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
pension benefits 
we sponsor four defined benefit pension plans in various forms for employees who meet eligibility requirements 
applicable accounting standards require that we make assumptions and use statistical variables in actuarial models to calculate our pension obligations and the related periodic pension expense 
the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
additional assumptions include the future rate of compensation increases  which is based on historical plan data and assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
depending on the assumptions selected  pension expense could vary significantly and could have a material effect on reported earnings 
the assumptions used can also materially affect the measurement of benefit obligations 
the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of projected future pension payments to all participants 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on aaa aa rated corporate long term bonds 
at september of each year  the discount rate is determined using bond yield curve models matched with the timing of expected retirement plan payments 
our discount rate assumption was percent as of september  holding all other assumptions constant  a hypothetical increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the plan funds invested in a specific target asset allocation 
the expected long term rate of return assumption on pension plan assets was percent in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately recently issued or adopted accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 which amends topic  comprehensive income 
the amendment allows an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this standard was effective for us beginning on october  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
