the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition for the three fiscal years ended march  the discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
except for the historical information contained herein  the discussions in this document contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under the item a  risk factors and  from time to time  in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
business overview we are a leading global manufacturer of a wide variety of capacitors 
our product offerings include tantalum  multilayer ceramic  solid and electrolytic aluminum and film and paper capacitors 
capacitors are fundamental components of most electronic circuits and are found in communication systems  data processing equipment  personal computers  cellular phones  automotive electronic systems  defense and aerospace systems  consumer electronics  power management systems and many other electronic devices and systems 
capacitors are typically used to filter out interference  smooth the output of power supplies  block the flow of direct current while allowing alternating current to pass and for many other purposes 
we manufacture a broad line of capacitors in many different sizes and configurations using a variety of raw materials 
our product line consists of over  distinct part configurations distinguished by various attributes  such as dielectric or insulating material  configuration  encapsulation  capacitance level and tolerance  performance characteristics and packaging 
most of our customers have multiple capacitance requirements  often within each of their products 
our broad product offering allows us to meet the majority of those needs independent of application and end use 
in fiscal year   and we shipped billion capacitors  billion capacitors  and billion capacitors  respectively 
we believe the medium to long term demand for the various types of capacitors we offer will continue to grow on a regional and global basis due to a variety of factors  including increasing demand for and complexity of electronic products  growing demand for technology in emerging markets and the ongoing development of new solutions for energy generation and conservation

recent developments and trends issuance of senior notes add on on april   we completed the sale of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due at an issue price of of the principal amount plus accrued interest from november  the senior notes were issued as additional notes under the indenture  dated may   among the company  the guarantors party thereto and wilmington trust company  as trustee 
on march   we completed the sale of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due at an issue price of of the principal amount plus accrued interest from november  the senior notes were issued as additional notes under the indenture  dated may   among the company  the guarantors party thereto and wilmington trust company  as trustee 
upon the completion of these transactions  we had million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due outstanding 
we will use the proceeds of these recent offerings to finance a portion of the acquisition of niotan incorporated niotan  make the initial payment of million under the nec tokin corporation 
table of contents nt transaction  pay related transactions fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes 
these transactions are described below 
equity investment on march   we entered into the stock purchase agreement to acquire of the common stock which will represent a of the economic interest of nt  a manufacturer of tantalum capacitors  electro magnetic  electro mechanical and access devices  from nec of japan 
revenue of nt for the fiscal year ended march  was jpy  million or approximately million 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including required regulatory filings 
the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year  at which time we will pay a purchase price of million for new shares of common stock of nt 
upon the initial closing  we will account for our equity investment in nt using the equity method in a non consolidated variable interest entity since we will not have the power to direct significant activities of nt 
in connection with our entry into the stock purchase agreement  we entered into the stockholders agreement with nt and nec  which provides for restrictions on transfers of nt s capital stock  certain tag along and first refusal rights on transfer  restrictions on nec s ability to convert the preferred stock of nt held by it  certain management services to be provided to nt by kemet electronics corporation or an affiliate of kemet electronics corporation and certain board representation rights 
at the initial closing  we will hold four of seven nt director positions 
however  nec will have significant board rights 
the stockholders agreement also contemplates a loan from nec to nt in connection with nt s rebuilding of its operations in thailand as a result of flooding that occurred in concurrent with entry into the stock purchase agreement and the stockholders agreement  we entered into the option agreement with nec whereby we may purchase additional shares of nt common stock from nt for a purchase price of million  resulting in an economic interest of approximately while maintaining ownership of of nt s common stock by providing notice of the first call option between the initial closing and august  upon providing such notice  we may also exercise an option to purchase all outstanding capital stock of nt from its stockholders  primarily nec  for a purchase price based on the greater of six times ltm ebitda as defined in the option agreement less the previous payments and certain other adjustments  or the outstanding amount of nt s debt obligation to nec by providing notice of the second call option by may  from august  through may   nec may require us to purchase all outstanding capital stock of nt from its stockholders  primarily nec 
however  nec may only exercise the put option from august  through april  if nt achieves certain financial performance 
the purchase price for the put option will be based on the greater of six times ltm ebitda less previous payments and certain other adjustments  or the outstanding amount of nt s debt obligation to nec as of the date the put option is exercised 
the purchase price for the put option is reduced by the amount of nt s debt obligation to nec which we will assume 
the determination of the purchase price will be modified in the event there is an unresolved agreement between nec and us under the stockholders agreement 
in the event the put option is exercised  nec will be required to maintain in place the outstanding debt obligation owed by nt to nec 
acquisitions on february   we acquired of all of the outstanding shares of niotan  a leading manufacturer of tantalum powders  from an affiliate of denham capital management lp 
this new subsidiary  kemet blue powder corporation blue powder  has its headquarters and principal operating location in carson city  nevada and we believe it is the largest production location for tantalum powder in the western hemisphere 

table of contents we paid an initial purchase price of million net of cash received at the closing of the transaction 
additional deferred payments of million are payable over a thirty month period and a working capital adjustment of million which was paid in april we are required to make quarterly royalty payments for tantalum powder produced by blue powder  in an aggregate amount equal to million by december  on june   we completed our acquisition of kemet foil  a tennessee based manufacturer of etched foils utilized as a core component in the manufacture of aluminum electrolytic capacitors 
the purchase price was million plus a million working capital adjustment amount  of which million net of cash received was paid at closing and million is to be paid on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date 
write down of long lived assets during fiscal year  we incurred impairment charges totaling million related to tantalum 
due to customer demands for lower esr capacitors we evaluated the costs we would need to incur in order to modify the product line to enable it to produce lower esr capacitors 
based on this evaluation  we have idled equipment with a net carrying value of million and plan to dispose of the equipment 
the impairment amount of million was the carrying amount of the equipment less the estimated scrap value net of disposal costs 
the impairment charge is recorded on the consolidated statements of operations line item write down of long lived assets in fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements as of march   other than operating lease commitments  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are summarized in note  organization and significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
the following identifies a number of policies which require significant judgments and estimates  or are otherwise deemed critical to our financial statements 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical data and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in addition  they affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our judgments are based on our assessment as to the effect certain estimates  assumptions  or future trends or events may have on the financial condition and results of operations reported in the consolidated financial statements 
readers should understand that actual future results could differ from these estimates  assumptions  and judgments 

table of contents a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available  can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors 
the amounts used to assess sensitivity ie    etc 
are included to allow readers of this annual report on form k to understand a general cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent our predictions of variability 
for all of these estimates  it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and estimates require regular review and adjustment 
we believe the following critical accounting policies contain the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a portion of sales consists of products designed to meet customer specific requirements 
these products typically have stricter tolerances making them useful to the specific customer requesting the product and to customers with similar or less stringent requirements 
products with customer specific requirements are tested and approved by the customer before we mass produce and ship the products 
we recognize revenue at shipment as the sales terms for products produced with customer specific requirements do not contain a final customer acceptance provision or other provisions that are unique and would otherwise allow the customer different acceptance rights 
a portion of sales is made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by distributors 
our distributor policy includes inventory price protection and ship from stock and debit sfsd programs common in the industry 
the price protection policy protects the value of the distributors inventory in the event we reduce our published selling price to distributors 
this program allows the distributor to debit us for the difference between our list price and the lower authorized price for specific parts 
we establish price protection reserves on specific parts residing in distributors inventories in the period that the price protection is formally authorized by kemet 
the sfsd program provides a mechanism for the distributor to meet a competitive price after obtaining authorization from the local company sales office 
this program allows the distributor to ship its higher priced inventory and debit us for the difference between our list price and the lower authorized price for that specific transaction 
we establish reserves for our sfsd program based primarily on historical sfsd activity and certain distributors actual inventory levels comprising approximately of the total global distributor inventory related to customers which participate in the sfsd program 
estimates are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
if these estimates were changed by in fiscal year  net sales would be impacted by million 
the establishment of these reserves is recognized as a component of the line item net sales on the consolidated statements of operations  while the associated reserves are included in the line item accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of inventories requires us to make estimates 
we also must assess the prices at which we believe the finished goods inventory can be sold compared to its cost 
a sharp decrease in demand could adversely impact earnings as the reserve estimates could increase 
pension and post retirement benefits 
our management  with the assistance of actuarial firms  performs actuarial valuations of the fair values of our pension and post retirement 
table of contents plans benefit obligations 
we make certain assumptions that have a significant effect on the calculated fair value of the obligations such as the weighted average discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation  salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on post retirement obligations  and medical cost inflation used to calculate the impact future medical costs will have on post retirement obligations 
we understand that these assumptions directly impact the actuarial valuation of the obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the income or expense that flows through the consolidated statements of operations 
we base our assumptions on either historical or market data that we consider reasonable 
variations in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reported in consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations 
the most critical assumption relates to the discount rate 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in changes to the projected benefit obligation of million and million  respectively 
asset impairment goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
we perform our impairment test during the first quarter of each fiscal year and when otherwise warranted 
we evaluate our goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
this requires us to estimate the fair value of the reporting units based on the future net cash flows expected to be generated 
the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit  with the corresponding carrying amounts 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill being measured exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the amounts assigned to identified net assets 
as a result  the implied fair value of goodwill is generally the residual amount that results from subtracting the value of net assets including all tangible assets and identified intangible assets from the fair value of the reporting unit s fair value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income based  discounted cash flow dcf analysis  and market based approaches guideline publicly traded company method and guideline transaction method which examine transactions in the marketplace involving the sale of the stocks of similar publicly owned companies  or the sale of entire companies engaged in operations similar to kemet 
in addition to the above described reporting unit valuation techniques  our goodwill impairment assessment also considers our aggregate fair value based upon the value of our outstanding shares of common stock 
long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset classified as held for sale is initially measured and reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the long lived asset is disposed of 
tests for the recoverability of a long lived asset to be held and used are performed by comparing the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash 
table of contents flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows  we use future projections of cash flows directly associated with  and which are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
these assumptions include  among other estimates  periods of operation and projections of sales and cost of sales 
changes in any of these estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if it is determined that the book value of a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value 
the fair value is calculated as the discounted cash flows of the underlying assets 
we perform impairment tests on our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life during the first quarter of each fiscal year and when otherwise warranted 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we completed our impairment test on our intangible assets with indefinite useful life and concluded that no further impairment existed 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate used in the valuation would have resulted in changes in the fair value of million and million  respectively 
in september  the fasb issued asu  guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
asu gives entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
otherwise  further testing would not be needed 
asu will be effective for our fiscal year testing 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions will not be realized  based on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the recent history of cumulative losses  and the insufficient evidence of projected future taxable income to overcome the loss history 
we have provided a valuation allowance related to any benefits from income taxes resulting from the application of a statutory tax rate to the deferred tax assets 
we continue to have net deferred tax assets future tax benefits in several jurisdictions which we expect to realize assuming  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient taxable income can be generated to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional tax expense 
the accounting rules require that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
any accruals for estimated interest and penalties would be recorded as a component of income tax expense 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes changed by of income before income taxes  consolidated net income would change by million in fiscal year 
table of contents results of operations historically  revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results due to various economic and other factors 
the following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated amounts in thousands fiscal years ended march  net sales operating costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses research and development restructuring charges write down of long lived assets net gain loss on sales and disposals of assets operating income interest income interest expense gain loss on early extinguishment of debt increase in value of warrant other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year overview net sales net sales for fiscal year were million  which represents a decrease from fiscal year net sales of  million 
film and electrolytic and ceramic sales increased by million and million  respectively  while tantalum net sales decreased million 
capacitor unit sales volume for fiscal year decreased as compared to fiscal year average selling prices for capacitors increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily related to our ability to increase sales prices to partially offset increases in tantalum raw material cost and a favorable shift in product line mix 
in addition  the film and electrolytic machinery division increased net sales by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in fiscal years and  net sales by region were as follows dollars in millions fiscal year fiscal year net sales of total net sales of total americas americas apac apac emea emea 
table of contents in fiscal years and  the percentages of net sales by channel to total net sales were as follows fiscal year fiscal year distributors ems oem gross margin gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to of net sales from of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
several factors contributed to the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal year the primary contributor to the gross margin decline was a million gross margin decrease in tantalum for the fiscal year compared to fiscal year despite our continued efforts to reduce costs through process engineering improvements and to pass raw material cost increases on to our customers  we were unable to completely offset the increase in raw material costs which resulted in a decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales 
partially offsetting this decrease was a million gross margin increase related to film and electrolytic for fiscal year compared to fiscal year this improvement was primarily due to higher average selling prices  a favorable shift in product line mix as well as an increase in gross margin within film and electrolytic s machinery division 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal year compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal year the million increase in sg a expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year includes the following increases million related to erp integration costs  million in salary expense for merit increases and certain additional headcount  million in acquisition related fees  million primarily related to an information technology infrastructure upgrade  million related to travel and million in selling expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in incentive compensation in fiscal year compared to fiscal year restructuring charges during fiscal year  we incurred million in restructuring charges compared to million in restructuring charges in fiscal year the restructuring charges in fiscal year included termination benefits of million related to facility closures in italy that is expected to occur during fiscal year and million to participate in a plan to save labor costs whereby a company may temporarily lay off employees while the government continues to pay their wages for a certain period of time 
these charges are a continuation of our efforts to restructure manufacturing operations within europe  primarily within film and electrolytic 
construction has commenced on a new manufacturing facility in pontecchio  italy  that will allow for the closure and consolidation of multiple manufacturing operations located in italy 
in addition  we incurred million in personnel reduction costs primarily due to headcount reductions in the mexican operations of tantalum 
in addition to these personnel reduction costs  we incurred manufacturing relocation costs of million for relocation of equipment to china and mexico 
the restructuring charges in fiscal year included million in charges for the relocation of equipment to mexico and china as well as relocation of the european distribution center  and 
table of contents million for reductions in workforce 
the million in personnel reduction costs related to the following headcount reductions in italy  million  the closure of our nantong  china plant expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal year  million  and million related to the company s initiative to reduce overhead within the company as a whole and headcount reductions in mexico 
these personnel reduction charges were offset by a million reversal of prior expenses primarily associated with the cassia integrazione guadagni straordinaria cigs plan as it was determined that only employees were expected to participate in the program through october the agreements with the labor unions allowed the company to place up to workers  on a rotation basis  on the cigs plan to save labor costs 
cigs is a temporary plan to save labor costs whereby a company may temporarily lay off employees while the government continues to pay their wages for a maximum of months for the program 
the employees who are in cigs are not working  but are still employed by the company 
only employees that are not classified as management or executive level personnel can participate in the cigs program 
upon termination of the plan  the affected employees return to work 
research and development research and development expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal year  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal year the increase resulted from increased research and development activities to ensure that products are available to support kemet s growth and to meet customers needs 
the growth in spending also reflects kemet s increased focus on specialty product development which requires an increase in sampling  tooling  and testing 
write down of long lived assets during fiscal year  we incurred impairment charges of million related to tantalum 
due to customer demands for lower esr capacitors we evaluated the costs we would need to incur in order to modify a production line in evora  portugal to enable it to produce lower esr capacitors 
based on this evaluation  we have idled equipment with a net carrying value of million and plan to dispose of the equipment 
the impairment amount of million was the carrying amount of the equipment less the estimated scrap value net of disposal costs 
the impairment charge is recorded on the consolidated statements of operations line item write down of long lived assets in fiscal year operating income operating income for fiscal year was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to the million decrease in gross margin in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and we incurred a million charge for the write down of long lived assets located in our portugal plant in fiscal year additionally  when comparing fiscal year to fiscal year  restructuring charges were million higher  sg a increased million and research and development expenses increased million 
also  during fiscal year a million gain on disposal of assets was realized primarily related to the sale of an idle facility in the us compared to a million loss on sales and disposals of assets in fiscal year 
table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net was a net expense of million in fiscal year compared to a net expense of million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
the improvement is attributable to a million non cash loss recognized on the early extinguishment of debt in fiscal year compared to none in fiscal year also  there was a million decrease in interest expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year offsetting these improvements was a million increase in the loss on foreign currency translation in fiscal year as compared to a million gain on foreign currency translation in fiscal year additionally  a net gain of million was recognized in fiscal year when we granted a supplier of tantalum powder  wire and related materials  a non exclusive license  with a right to sublicense  concerning certain patents and patent applications 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  resulting in an income tax expense of million 
this compares to an effective income tax rate of for fiscal year that resulted in an income tax expense of million

we believe adjusted ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are  by definition  available to pay interest  and tax expense is inversely correlated to interest expense because tax expense goes down as deductible interest expense 
table of contents goes up  depreciation and amortization are non cash charges 
the other items excluded from adjusted ebitda are excluded in order to better reflect our continuing operations 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda  one should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments noted above 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these types of adjustments 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
our adjusted ebitda measure has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  it does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and our adjusted ebitda measure does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  it is not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows  it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not be indicative of our ongoing operations  it does not reflect limitations on or costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us  and other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 
you should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance removes the presentation options in accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income  and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income 
asu defers the requirement in asu that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of aoci in both oci and net income on the face of the financial statements 
asu requires companies to continue to present amounts reclassified out of aoci on the face of the financial statements or disclosed in the notes to 
table of contents the financial statements 
asu also defers the requirement to report reclassification adjustments in interim periods and requires companies to present only total comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two consecutive statements in interim periods 
asu and asu will be effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december  the company elected to early adopt this asu as of march  in september  the fasb issued asu  guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
asu gives entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
otherwise  further testing would not be needed 
asu will be effective for fiscal and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting standard will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
there are currently no other accounting standards that have been issued that will have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption 
effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of labor  equipment  and raw materials 
we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our business over the past three fiscal years except for the following discussion in commodity price risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our other borrowing activities  which had an outstanding balance as of march   of million 
this other debt has a variable interest rate and a change in the interest rate would yield a million change in interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk given our international operations and sales  we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates 
of these  the most significant are currently the euro and the mexican peso 
a portion of our sales to our customers and operating costs in europe are denominated in euro creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
also  a portion of our costs in our mexican operations are denominated in mexican pesos  creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
additionally  certain of our non us subsidiaries make sales denominated in us dollars which expose them to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
historically  in order to minimize our exposure  we periodically entered into forward foreign exchange contracts in which the future cash flows were hedged against the us dollar 
the company does not presently have in place any forward foreign exchange contracts  but does periodically evaluate the use of such contracts as a means of hedging its foreign exchange exposure 
commodity price risk in fiscal year  we experienced significant raw material price fluctuations in the tantalum supply chain 
we began the process of reducing the complexity and uncertainty of the tantalum raw material supply by vertically integrating our supply chain 
the acquisition of blue powder  along with our ability to source and process conflict free tantalum ore  will allow us to achieve our vertical integration goal 
except for the processing of raw ore into potassium heptafluorotantalate  we now have the ability to manufacture the majority of our tantalum powder requirements 

table of contents palladium is a precious metal used in the manufacture of multilayer ceramic capacitors and is mined primarily in russia and south africa 
we continue to pursue ways to reduce palladium usage in ceramic capacitors in order to minimize the price risk 
the amount of palladium that we require has generally been available in sufficient quantities  however the price of palladium is driven by the market which has shown significant price fluctuations 
for instance  in fiscal year the price of palladium fluctuated between and per troy ounce 
price increases and the possibility of our inability to pass such increases on to our customers could have an adverse effect on profitability 
silver and aluminum have generally been available in sufficient quantities  and we believe there are a sufficient number of suppliers from which we can purchase our requirements 
an increase in the price of silver and aluminum that we are unable to pass on to our customers  however  could have an adverse effect on our profitability
