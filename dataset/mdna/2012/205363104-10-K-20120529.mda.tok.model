overview csc provides information technology and business process outsourcing  consulting  systems integration and other information technology services to its customers 
the company targets the delivery of these services within three broad lines of business or sectors north american public sector nps  managed services sector mss  and business solutions and services bss 
the company s reportable segments are as follows the nps segment provides services to the us federal government and its agencies  civil departments and branches of military  and operates principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements  including federal acquisition regulations  cost accounting standards and audits by various us federal agencies 
the mss segment provides large scale infrastructure and application outsourcing solutions offerings as well as mid size services delivery to customers globally 
the bss segment provides industry specific consulting and systems integration services  business process outsourcing  and intellectual property based software solutions 
for additional information regarding our business segments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
economic and industry factors the company s results of operations are impacted by economic conditions generally  including macroeconomic conditions 
we are monitoring current macroeconomic and credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and their potential effect on our clients and on us 
a severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies in which we operate 
this may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations 
particularly in light of recent economic uncertainty  we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations 
our results of operations are also affected by levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve  as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 
the ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance 
revenues are driven by our ability to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients 
our ability to add value to clients  and therefore generate revenues  depends in part on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 
the bss and mss segment markets are affected by various economic and industry factors 
the economic environment in the regions csc serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on information technology it projects 
csc is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors  including service offerings and flexibility 
management monitors industry factors including relative market shares  growth rates  billing rates  staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates  inflation rates and foreign currency rates 
outsourcing contracts are typically long term relationships 
long term  complex outsourcing contracts  including their consulting components  require ongoing review of the terms and scope of work  in order to meet clients evolving business needs and our performance expectations 
more recently  the company has implemented a strategy of promoting and selling defined solutions that require less customization and benefit from leveraged delivery at scale 
such solutions include our portfolio of cloud based infrastructure as a service offerings  managed applications services and a range of discrete offerings for computing  storage  mobility and networking services 
the nps segment market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics 
all us government contracts and subcontracts may be modified  curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change 
in the event that a contract is terminated for convenience  the company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed 
shifting priorities of the us government can also impact the future of projects 
management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts  legislative activity  budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations 
business drivers revenue in all three lines of business is generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to ten years or more 
factors affecting revenue include the company s ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards  satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes  compete on services offered  delivery models offered  technical ability and innovation  quality  flexibility  global reach  experience  and results created  and identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues 
earnings are impacted by the above revenue factors and  in addition  the company s ability to control costs  particularly labor costs  subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare  pension and general and administrative costs  anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses  accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals  develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore  and manage foreign currency fluctuations related to international operations 
cash flows are affected by the above earnings factors and  in addition  by the following factors timely management of receivables and payables  investment opportunities available  particularly related to business acquisitions  dispositions and large outsourcing contracts  and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means  with the primary financial measures including new contract wins  revenue growth  margins  and cash flow 
new contract wins in addition to being a primary driver of future revenue  new contract wins also provide management an assessment of the company s ability to compete 
the total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or re competed contracts  as well as numerous external factors 
revenue growth year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins  and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts 
with a wide array of services offered  the company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers 
in addition  incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs  particularly overhead and other indirect costs  thus potentially improving profit margins 
foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth 
margins margins reflect the company s performance on contracts and ability to control costs 
while the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability 
although the majority of the company s costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues  increased use of offshore support also exposes csc to additional margin fluctuations 
cash flow primary drivers of the company s cash flow are earnings provided by the company s operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings 
also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances 
the company also regularly reviews the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap cash flow measurements of operating  investing and financing cash flows  as well as the non gaap measure free cash flow 
fiscal highlights fiscal results were adversely impacted by certain large adjustments that reduced revenue and increased costs 
these significant adjustments are listed below and described in detail later in this section and also in the results of operations section 
impact of adjustment amounts in millions favorable unfavorable revenues costs loss from continuing operations before taxes specified contract charge settlement charge restructuring costs goodwill impairment asset impairments net adjustments on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method legal and other fees on sec and audit committee investigations transaction and transition costs associated with acquisition of isoft the key operating results for fiscal include revenues decreased million or  and decreased on a constant currency basis 
of the constant currency decrease  was due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the charge associated with a uk s national health service nhs contract and the settlement of claims associated with a us government contract 
the revenue decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue of from the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions 
loss from continuing operations before taxes was  million  compared to income from continuing operations before taxes of million in fiscal  a decrease of  million  or 
operating income decreased to a loss of  million as compared to operating income of  million in fiscal  and operating income margins decreased to from in the fiscal net loss attributable to csc common shareholders was  million  a decrease of  million  or  as compared to the prior year 
diluted earnings loss per share eps was for fiscal  a decrease of as compared to the prior year 
for fiscal  diluted eps was comprised of from continuing operations and from discontinued operations  as compared to and  respectively  in the prior year 
during the second quarter  the company reached a definitive settlement agreement with the us government in its contract claims asserted under the contract disputes act of cda  and recorded a pre tax charge of million  which included a million reduction of revenue 
the charge reflected the write down of claim related assets unbilled receivables and deferred costs  offset by cash received of million and the estimated fair value of a contract extension of million 
during the third quarter  the company recorded a charge associated with the uk nhs contract of  million  which included a million reduction of revenue 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  million during fiscal in the second quarter  the company recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of  million  of which  million related to the mss segment and million related to the bss segment 
during the third quarter  the company recorded a million goodwill impairment  all of which related to the bss segment 
during the fourth quarter  the company recorded restructuring costs of million  of which million is related to the mss segment  million is related to the bss segment  and million is related to the nps segment 
during fiscal  the company recorded million of net adverse adjustments on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method and million of impairments of assets related primarily to outsourcing contracts with service delivery issues 
the company announced contract awards of billion  including new mss segment awards of billion  nps segment awards of billion  and bss segment awards of billion 
total backlog at the end of fiscal was billion  an increase of billion as compared to the backlog at the end of fiscal of billion 
of the total billion backlog  billion is expected to be realized as revenue in fiscal of the total billion  billion is not yet funded 
days sales outstanding dso was days at march   an improvement from days at april  debt to total capitalization ratio was at year end  an increase of points from at fiscal year end  reflecting the current year net loss attributable to csc common shareholders of  million with corresponding impact on csc stockholders equity 
cash provided by operating activities was  million  as compared to  million during fiscal cash used in investing activities was  million  as compared to million during fiscal cash used in financing activities was million  as compared to  million during fiscal free cash flow of million in fiscal was down from million in fiscal  driven primarily by the company s operating performance and net cash outflows associated with a uk nhs contract  partially offset by cash received from the us government upon settlement of contract claims 
selected references are made on a constant currency basis so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates  thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period 
financial results on a constant currency basis are calculated by translating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period s currency conversion rates 
this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
operating income is a non us generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure used by management to assess performance at the segments and on a consolidated basis 
the company s definition of such measure may differ from other companies 
we define operating income as revenue less costs of services  depreciation and amortization expense  and segment general and administrative g a expense  excluding corporate g a 
management compensates for the limitations of this non gaap measure by also reviewing income loss from continuing operations before taxes  which includes costs excluded from the operating income definition such as goodwill impairment  corporate g a  interest and other income 
a reconciliation of consolidated operating loss income to loss income from continuing operations before taxes is as follows twelve months ended amounts in millions march  april  april  operating loss income corporate g a interest expense interest income goodwill impairment other income expense  net loss income from continuing operations before taxes backlog represents total estimated contract value of predominantly long term contracts  based on customer commitments that the company believes to be firm 
backlog value is based on contract commitments  management s judgment and assumptions about volume of services  availability of customer funding and other factors 
backlog estimates for government contracts include both the funded and unfunded portions and all of the option periods 
backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements 
for nps  announced award values for competitive indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity idiq awards represent the expected contract value at the time a task order is awarded under the contract 
announced values for non competitive idiq awards represent management s estimate at the award date 
business awards for mss are estimated at the time of contract signing based on then existing projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates  and include option years 
bss award values are based on firm commitments 
beginning in fiscal  we revised our estimation of bss awards to account for larger business solution and service awards 
prior period awards and backlog have been revised to conform to the current year presentation 
dso is calculated as total receivables at the fiscal period end divided by revenue per day 
revenue per day equals total revenues divided by the number of days in the fiscal period 
total receivables includes unbilled receivables but excludes tax receivables and long term receivables 
debt to total capitalization ratio is defined as total current and long term debt divided by total debt and equity  including noncontrolling interest 
free cash flow is a non gaap measure and the company s definition of such measure may differ from that of other companies 
we define free cash flow as equal to the sum of operating cash flows  investing cash flows  excluding business acquisitions  dispositions and investments including short term investments and purchase or sale of available for sale securities and payments on capital leases and other long term asset financings 
csc s free cash flow measure does not distinguish operating cash flows from investing cash flows as they are required to be presented in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for operating and investing cash flows as determined in accordance with gaap 
free cash flow is one of the factors csc management uses in reviewing the overall performance of the business 
management compensates for the limitations of this non gaap measure by also reviewing the gaap measures of operating  investing and financing cash flows as well as debt levels measured by the debt to total capitalization ratio 
a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is presented below twelve months ended amounts in millions march  april  april  free cash flow net cash used in investing activities acquisitions  net of cash acquired business dispositions short term investments payments on capital leases and other long term asset financings net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities the company has developed a broad  long term revenue base which includes customers spread across multiple industries and geographic regions as well as service lines 
a significant amount of csc s revenue is derived from long term contracts including information technology outsourcing  build and maintain engagements and us federal government engagements 
this provides the company with a base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow or the market for certain services softens 
the company s significant wins and scope extensions during fiscal included the following nps us army billion state of maryland million us citizenship and immigration services million mss bae systems million educational testing service over million bss financial services industry clients billion technology and consumer services industry clients million health services industry clients million cash and cash equivalents at march   was approximately billion  down from billion at april   a million decrease 
the decrease was a result of financing and investing cash outflows of million and  million  respectively  during fiscal  offset by operating cash inflows of  million 
net loss adjusted for non cash charges drove the operating cash inflows  higher purchases of property and equipment and business acquisitions drove the investing cash outflows  and a repayment on the company s credit facility drove the financing outflows 
cash and cash equivalents at april   was approximately billion  down from billion at april   a million decrease 
the decrease was a result of financing and investing cash outflows of billion cash and million  respectively  during fiscal  offset by operating cash inflows of billion 
net income drove the operating cash inflows  higher purchases of property and equipment and business acquisitions drove the investing cash outflows  and a repayment on the company s credit facility drove the financing outflows 
results of operations revenues revenues for the nps  mss  and bss segments for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal are as follows twelve months ended march  april  april  amounts in millions amount percent change amount percent change amount nps mss bss corporate subtotal eliminations total revenue the major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows twelve months ended march  vs

other revenues consist of foreign  state and local government work as well as commercial contracts performed by the nps segment 
fiscal nps segment revenue decreased million  or as compared to fiscal this decrease was due to its department of defense group dod contracts  which had a million  or decrease 
partially offsetting the decline in revenue on dod contracts were increases in revenue from contracts with civil agencies civil  which had a million  or increase  and increases in revenue from other contracts  which had a million  or increase 
fiscal nps revenue was adversely impacted by net million of adjustments on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
of such adjustments  million reduced revenue and million increased revenue 
the decreases in revenue on dod contracts  primarily with the us army and the us air force  were due to a combination of completion of existing task orders  a contract termination and net reduction in scope and tasking on other existing contracts 
in addition  revenue was adversely impacted by the contract claims settlement with the us federal government in the second quarter of million see note to the consolidated financial statements and by a million adjustment on a contract with the us air force accounted for under the percentage of completion method due to a stop work order 
the increase in revenue from civil agencies was primarily due to contracts with the department of homeland security dhs  the department of human and health services dhhs and the social security administration that commenced during the second half of fiscal these increases were partially offset by revenue that did not recur due to contract completions  primarily the us census support contract  as well as reduced scope on certain other contracts  primarily with the environmental protection agency epa  department of transportation  department of energy and the internal revenue service 
the increase in revenue from other contracts was primarily due to higher revenue on a contract with a state agency for the development of a healthcare administration system 
the higher revenue on this contract was partially offset by a million adverse adjustment resulting from revised estimates under the percentage of completion accounting method 
of the million revenue reduction  million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
many of our government customers continue to experience uncertainty about their fiscal budgets due to the budget control act of as a result  large program awards are delayed and customers are shifting to smaller and shorter term contracts 
nps won new contracts of billion during fiscal compared to billion during fiscal fiscal nps segment revenue decreased  or million  for fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding two small acquisitions made at the end of the second and third quarters of fiscal  revenue decreased 
dod revenue declined slightly despite higher revenues on several programs 
the increases were offset by contract completions  the adverse effects from reduced tasking on two us army contracts  as well as from the impact of a one time  million revenue benefit in fiscal from a claim settlement that did not repeat in fiscal civil declines came primarily from contracts with the dhhs  the department of transportation and the epa that either ended or experienced reductions in customer spending 
one factor affecting the overall year over year revenue decline was an ongoing uncertainty among many government customers about their fiscal budgets and potential budget cuts due to ongoing congressional debates and temporary continuing resolutions on the current budget 
also impacting the year over year change is the increasing trend in contested awards  thereby slowing the ultimate start date of many contracts 
for example  csc won a significant award with the transportation security administration in fiscal but protests resulted in numerous delays of up to ten months 
another factor affecting many government contractors is the recent renewed government initiative to insource personnel rather than use external providers 
the impact was not significant on csc s results given the nature of the types of services we provide  and we expect a diminished impact in the future as government agencies revisit the costs and benefits of such an initiative 
during fiscal  the company announced federal contract awards with a total value of billion compared to billion during fiscal managed services sector fiscal mss segment revenue increased million  or as compared to fiscal in constant currency  revenue decreased million  or 
the foreign currency impact was primarily due to the movement in the us dollar against the australian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the swiss franc 
mss second quarter acquisition of applabs see note to the consolidated financial statements provided revenue of million  or of the revenue growth 
excluding the impact of foreign currency effects and the acquisition  fiscal net internal revenue decreased million  or as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to net volume and scope reductions of approximately million and contract conclusions and terminations of approximately million  partially offset by revenue from new contracts of approximately million 
in addition  revenue was impacted by certain one time adjustments  including adverse adjustments on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of million and missed service level metrics of million due to delays on certain outsourcing contracts  partially offset by a favorable adjustment on termination of a contract of million 
the mss year over year revenue trend was also adversely impacted by out of period adjustments 
the out of period revenue decreases recorded in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company announced contract awards with a total value of billion compared to billion during fiscal fiscal new contracts awards include billion of successful recompetes 
fiscal mss segment revenue grew million  or in fiscal  and increased excluding foreign currency effects 
the overall mss growth was primarily from a combination of new client engagements won in fiscal and  which generated approximately million revenue in fiscal  as well as growth on existing accounts which contributed million in year over year growth 
partly offsetting the increases were contract conclusions and terminations of million plus volume and scope reductions on existing accounts totaling million 
during fiscal  the company announced contract awards with a total value of billion compared to billion during fiscal business solutions services fiscal bss segment revenue increased million  or as compared to fiscal in constant currency  revenue decreased million  or 
the foreign currency impact was primarily due to the movement in the us dollar against the australian dollar  the british pound and the euro 
the acquisition of isoft and the other fiscal and fiscal acquisitions provided million  or of the year over year revenue increase 
excluding the effect of foreign currency movements and acquisitions  bss fiscal revenue decreased million  or over the prior year 
the lower net internal fiscal revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenue on the uk nhs contract of million  which was adversely impacted by the third quarter million revenue write down see note to the consolidated financial statements and by fiscal milestone revenue of million that did not recur in fiscal bss health vertical also had reduced revenue due to continuing softness in the life sciences market and certain project completions in north america 
both of these revenue decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in the other verticals of bss consulting group 
the consulting group s growth was primarily in north america  which offset revenue shortfalls in other regions 
the bss year over year revenue trend was also adversely impacted by out of period adjustments 
the out of period revenue adjustments recorded in fiscal and fiscal were revenue decreases of million and revenue increases of million  respectively see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  bss had contract awards of billion compared to billion in fiscal fiscal bss segment revenue increased million  or in fiscal  and increased excluding foreign currency effects 
acquisitions accounted for approximately million or of the year over year increase 
the remaining growth resulted primarily from increases in the bss consulting business in financial services  which grew million year over year  and from other consulting operations which were up million  excluding acquisitions 
additional growth came from an asia hardware resale business and an australian it staffing operation which contributed million 
offsetting the increases was a revenue decline on the nhs by million due to delays in milestone deliverables 
the financial services group benefited from increased business process outsourcing services as well as from higher software and project related services 
other than healthcare related operations  other consulting operations grew million and were up by double digit rates in select regions  including europe s western region  brazil and australia  and were also up slightly in the us  while down in other regions across europe 
healthcare related consulting operations were down million  however  primarily due to the conclusion of a major contract with a large insurance company and continued uncertainty in the us marketplace regarding healthcare reform 
during fiscal  bss had contract awards of billion compared to billion in fiscal costs and expenses the company s total costs and expenses were as follows twelve months ended percentage of revenue dollars in millions costs of services excludes depreciation and amortization  specified contract charge  settlement charge and restructuring costs of cost of services specified contract charge excludes amount charged to revenue of cost of services settlement charge excludes amount charged to revenue of selling  general and administrative excludes restructuring costs of depreciation and amortization restructuring costs goodwill impairment interest expense  net other income expense  net total fiscal total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal were  up from in fiscal the increase in the total costs and expenses ratio was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge  the specified contract charge and the settlement charge  all of which were recorded prior to the fourth quarter  and the restructuring costs recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal the total costs and expenses ratio was also impacted by certain out of period adjustments recorded during fiscal  and  as described below 
cost of services  excluding depreciation and amortization  the specified contract charge  the settlement charge and the fourth quarter restructuring costs of million  as a percentage of revenue increased points to from in fiscal  primarily as a result of certain adverse fourth quarter adjustments recorded by mss as further discussed below 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding restructuring charges of million  as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points primarily due to the legal fees associated with the sec and the audit committee s investigations of million 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points primarily due to higher capital expenditures on existing and new contracts 
fiscal costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  up from in fiscal cost of services rose percentage points as a result of adverse adjustments in mss and bss including out of period adjustments primarily in mss as further discussed below 
selling  general and administrative expense ratio and depreciation and amortization ratio both improved percentage points as a result of ongoing cost and capital expenditure reduction initiatives 
other income of million was primarily due to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains 
investigations and out of period adjustments summary of audit committee and sec investigations related to the out of period adjustments background as previously disclosed in fiscal  the company initiated an investigation into out of period adjustments resulting from certain accounting errors in our mss segment  primarily involving accounting irregularities in the nordic region 
initially  the investigation was conducted by company personnel  but outside company counsel and forensic accountants retained by such counsel later assisted in the company s investigation 
on january   the company was notified by the sec s division of enforcement that it had commenced a formal civil investigation relating to these matters  which investigation has subsequently been expanded to other matters subsequently identified by the sec  including matters specified in subpoenas issued to the company from time to time by the sec s division of enforcement as well as matters under investigation by the audit committee of the board of directors  as further described below 
the company is cooperating in the sec s investigation 
on may   the audit committee commenced an independent investigation into the matters relating to the mss segment and the nordic region  matters identified by subpoenas issued by the sec s division of enforcement  and certain other accounting matters identified by the audit committee and retained independent counsel to represent csc on behalf of  and under the exclusive direction of  the audit committee in connection with such independent investigation 
independent counsel has retained forensic accountants to assist their work 
independent counsel also represents csc on behalf of  and under the exclusive direction of  the audit committee in connection with the investigation by the sec s division of enforcement 
the audit committee s investigation has been expanded to encompass i the company s operations in australia  ii certain aspects of the company s accounting practices within its americas outsourcing operation  and iii certain of the company s accounting practices that involve the percentage of completion accounting method  including the company s contract with nhs 
in the course of the audit committee s expanded investigation  accounting errors and irregularities have been identified 
as a result  certain personnel have been reprimanded  suspended  terminated and or resigned 
all of these investigative activities are ongoing 
any out of period adjustments identified  including items that self corrected within a fiscal year  by the company to date are hereinafter identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the sec also has expanded its investigation into the foregoing areas as well as into certain related disclosure matters 
the sec s investigative activities are ongoing 
in addition  the sec s division of corporation finance has issued comment letters to the company requesting  among other things  additional information regarding its previously disclosed adjustments in connection with the above referenced accounting errors  the company s conclusions relating to materiality of such adjustments  and the company s analysis of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 
the division of corporation finance s comment letter process is ongoing  and the company is continuing to cooperate with that process 
the investigations being conducted by the sec s division of enforcement and the audit committee as well as the review of our financial disclosures by the sec s division of corporation finance are continuing and could identify other accounting errors  irregularities or other areas of review 
as a result  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal and accounting expenditures  and a significant amount of time of our senior management has been focused on these matters that otherwise would have been focused on the growth of the company 
we are unable to predict how long the division of enforcement s and audit committee s investigations will continue or whether  at the conclusion of its investigation  the sec will seek to impose fines or take other actions against us 
in addition  we are unable to predict the timing of the completion of the division of corporation finance s review of our financial disclosures or the outcome of such review 
publicity surrounding the foregoing or any enforcement action as a result of the sec s investigation  even if ultimately resolved favorably for us  could have an adverse impact on our reputation  business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
during fiscal  the company recorded million of pre tax adjustments that should have been recorded in prior fiscal years 
the total out of period adjustments recorded in fiscal were comprised of million of charges reducing income from continuing operations before taxes originating out of the company s mss operations in the nordic region  and million of adjustments increasing income from continuing operations before taxes  with million of the million within mss 
the company recorded million of out of period adjustments in fiscal  which included million of charges in the nordic region  million of charges in the company s operations in australia  and million of charges originating from the nhs contract in the company s bss segment 
additionally  million and million of charges were recorded in the nps segment and other operations of the company  respectively 
the fiscal out of period adjustments primarily related to the company s mss and bss segments  with million and million within mss and bss  respectively 
certain additional items have been identified but not yet recorded related to the nhs contract that could have an effect on the amount and the allocation of the out of period adjustments for fiscal and prior fiscal years 
management does not believe that the effect of these additional items is material to the company s financial statements 
however  the investigation into these additional items is ongoing  and the amount could change and the allocation across years is likely to change 
the rollover impact on income loss from continuing operations before taxes of the recorded out of period adjustments is attributable to the following prior fiscal years increase decrease amounts in millions fiscal adjustments fiscal adjustments total adjustments fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal unaudited prior fiscal years unaudited nordic region as noted above  during fiscal  the company commenced an investigation into accounting irregularities in the nordic region 
based upon the company s investigation  review of the underlying documentation for certain transactions and balances  review of contract documentation and discussions with nordic personnel  the company attributes the majority of the million pre tax adjustments recorded in the nordic region in fiscal to accounting irregularities arising from suspected intentional misconduct by certain former employees in our danish subsidiaries 
the company attributes the million in pre tax adjustments recorded in the nordic region in fiscal to miscellaneous errors and not to any accounting irregularities or intentional misconduct other than a million operating lease adjustment noted in the first quarter of fiscal which was a refinement of an error previously corrected and reported in fiscal australia in the course of the australia investigation initiated in fiscal  accounting errors and irregularities have been identified 
as a result  certain personnel in australia have been reprimanded  suspended  terminated and or resigned 
based upon the information developed to date  and the company s assessment of the same  the company has identified and recorded during fiscal  million of adjustments reducing income from continuing operations before taxes relating to its operations in australia 
such adjustments have been categorized as either intentional accounting irregularities intentional irregularities or other accounting errors other errors 
other accounting errors include both unintentional errors and errors for which the categorization is unclear 
the categorizations were provided to the company through the independent investigation 
the impact of the adjustments on income loss from continuing operations before taxes is attributable to the following prior fiscal years increase decrease amounts in millions fy prior unaudited fy unaudited fy fy total intentional irregularities other errors americas outsourcing in the course of the independent investigation of americas outsourcing accounting practices  accounting conventions used by americas outsourcing relating to intraperiod cost allocations were determined to be unintentional accounting errors 
the errors did not have an impact on a fiscal year basis 
the company also determined that other operating units employed similar practices and made necessary corrections 
the company has determined that the impact of these corrections was not material on any fiscal year 
in addition to the adjustments discussed above  a million out of period adjustment related to an understatement of a fiscal management incentive compensation expense disclosed in the first quarter of fiscal has been determined by the company to be a million out of period adjustment as a result of the investigation 
this item included multiple components  a portion of which the company previously considered not to be related to out of period errors 
based on the results of the independent investigation  the company now attributes these adjustments to other errors  which include both unintentional errors and errors for which the categorization is unclear 
nhs in fiscal  million of out of period adjustments reducing income from continuing operations related to the company s nhs contract were identified and recorded 
during the course of the investigation in fiscal of the percentage of completion accounting method used on the company s nhs contract  certain accounting errors were identified related to costs incurred under the contract  which resulted in errors in the recognition of income from continuing operations that would have reduced by approximately million the billion write off recorded by the company in the third quarter of fiscal although the company has concluded that these errors do not appear to have any impact on amounts charged to the nhs  the errors have impacted the operating income recognized on the nhs contract 
the exclusion of certain costs incurred under the contract caused the estimated margin at completion  which determines the operating income that is booked when revenue milestones are achieved  to be overstated 
although the company has concluded that there is no cumulative impact as a result of the billion charge relating to the nhs contract recorded as of december   operating income from fiscal year through and including fiscal has been overstated by a total of approximately million and  therefore  the charge taken by the company as of december  was overstated by approximately the same amount 
certain additional items have been identified but not yet recorded related to the nhs contract that could have an effect on the amount and the allocation of the out of period adjustments for fiscal and prior fiscal years 
management does not believe that the effect of these additional items is material to the company s financial statements 
however  the investigation into these additional items is ongoing  and the amount could change and the allocation across years is likely to change 
certain csc finance employees based in the united kingdom were aware prior to fiscal of the aforementioned errors  but those employees failed to appropriately correct the errors 
therefore  the company has classified these errors as intentional 
such categorization was provided to the company through the independent investigation 
as a result  certain personnel have been suspended and additional disciplinary actions are being considered 
in addition to the nhs accounting errors discussed above  the company identified and recorded a million adjustment in fiscal to write off contract acquisition costs that were inappropriately capitalized in fiscal year the company has classified this error as unintentional 
the investigation also identified a transaction which was treated as a cost item but should have been treated as a reduction in revenue 
this has resulted in an overstatement of revenue and an overstatement of operating costs from fiscal to fiscal of million

based upon the company s investigation  review of the underlying documentation for certain transactions and balances  review of contract documentation and discussions with nordic personnel  the company attributes the majority of the out of period adjustments identified and recorded in the nordic region in fiscal to accounting irregularities arising from suspected intentional misconduct by certain former employees in our danish subsidiaries

furthermore  at the end of the second quarter  sufficient indicators existed to require performance of an additional  interim goodwill impairment analysis  and the bss gbs reporting unit again had a fair value that was below carrying value 
management believed that the decline in the estimated fair values of these reporting units was a result of several factors  including uncertainty about the company s overall value as reflected in csc s stock price decline over the first half of fiscal  overall decline in the broader stock market as indicated by reduced performance metric multiples at comparable public companies  and decline in forecasted operating performance of these reporting units 
the september  interim goodwill testing also indicated that the fair values of two reporting units bss health and bss isoft passed step one but were not considered to be substantially in excess of carrying values 
bss health had a fair value estimated to be approximately in excess of its carrying value 
for bss isoft  which was acquired during the second quarter and was a new reporting unit  fair value approximated carrying value due to the proximity of its acquisition to the second quarter interim goodwill impairment test 
for the remaining reporting units with goodwill  fair values substantially exceeded carrying values 
during the process of conducting the second steps of the annual and the interim goodwill impairment tests  the company identified significant unrecognized intangible assets primarily customer relationship and technology assets which  along with fair value changes to the carrying values of other assets and liabilities as well as the lower reporting unit fair values calculated in step one  resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of goodwill for the mss  bss gbs and bss health reporting units 
as a result  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  million of which  million related to the mss reporting unit  million related to the bss gbs reporting unit  and million related to the bss health reporting unit 
by the end of the second quarter  the company was not able to complete all the analyses associated with the annual and the interim impairment goodwill impairment tests primarily because of the complexity and the effort required to fair value all the assets and liabilities of the three reporting units which are spread across the globe  consequently  the amount of goodwill impairment recorded at the end of the second quarter represented management s best estimate 
during the third quarter  the company completed all analyses related to the annual and interim goodwill impairment tests  and identified adjustments that reduced the impairment loss recorded in the second quarter by million 
the entire adjustment was associated with the bss health reporting unit  and resulted from finalizing tax estimates and customer technology asset fair values 
thus  the total second quarter goodwill impairment loss was adjusted to  million 
at the end of the third quarter  the company assessed whether there were any events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company concluded that such indicators were present for two of its reporting units  bss health and bss isoft 
with respect to bss health  the loss of a significant customer  the failure to win some major bids for new business  and reduction in forecasted earnings was considered a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test 
for bss isoft  the recent developments on the nhs contract were considered a triggering event see note 
there were no triggering events for the remaining reporting units with goodwill 
in conducting the first step of the third quarter interim goodwill impairment test for the bss health reporting unit  the factors stated above resulted in a reassessment of forecasted cash flow assumptions under an income approach  as well as a revised valuation using a market multiples fair value approach  which led the weighted average fair value of the reporting unit to be less than its carrying value  thus triggering the need to proceed to step two 
for the bss isoft reporting unit however  the weighted average fair value was estimated to be greater than its carrying value due to better than forecast performance on the core isoft business not related to the nhs contract 
during the process of conducting the second step of the third quarter interim goodwill impairment test for bss health  the company estimated the fair value of its tangible assets and identified unrecognized intangible assets  primarily customer relationship and technology assets  and recorded an impairment charge of million 
after recording the third quarter charge of million  the bss health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of the fourth quarter  the company assessed if there were events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below their carrying amounts 
there were no such indicators for any of the reporting units with goodwill and therefore an interim goodwill test was not required to be performed 
any further significant declines in csc s stock price or any further significant adverse changes in the business climate or operating results could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis of goodwill in future periods prior to the next annual test 
cost of services specified contract charge as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  csc and nhs are parties to a billion approximately billion at originally announced exchange rates contract under which the company is developing and deploying an integrated electronic patient records system 
the contract has been accounted for using the percentage of completion method based on management s best estimates of total contract revenue and costs 
as described more fully below  the company recorded a charge of  million in the fiscal third quarter  with million recorded as a reduction of revenue  in connection with the company s ongoing negotiations with the nhs 
on february   nhs formally notified the company that it believed the company s failure to achieve a key milestone constituted a breach of contract and nhs was considering its position on termination of all or parts of the contract  however  nhs subsequently clarified that its notice was not intended to suggest that termination is the only option which it was considering and  in fact  nhs was considering the full range of options it believed were available to nhs 
notwithstanding this dispute  both nhs and the company continued discussions leading to agreement on the terms of a memorandum of understanding mou  the terms of which would ultimately be reflected in a contract amendment 
negotiation of the terms of the mou were substantially completed in may subsequent government reviews of the mou occurred 
in november  the company  the nhs and cabinet officials resumed discussions on the mou and the way forward  which included discussions regarding a proposed contract amendment with different scope modifications and contract value reductions than those contemplated by the mou 
in late december  csc was informed that neither the mou nor the contract amendment then under discussion would be approved by the government 
notwithstanding the failure to reach agreement  csc and the nhs continued discussions in regarding proposals advanced by both parties reflecting scope modifications and contract value reductions that differed materially from those contemplated by the mou 
as a result of these discussions  csc and the nhs entered into a non binding letter of intent on march  under the letter of intent  the nhs and csc have agreed to a set of high level principles  which are intended to be reflected in a binding interim agreement to be entered into by the parties 
the non binding letter of intent contemplates that under the interim agreement  nhs will provide a commitment of a certain number of trusts  some to be named in the interim agreement and the remainder within six months  to receive the lorenzo software product  which has been redefined into deployment units categorized as base product and additional product for pricing purposes 
in addition to the amounts committed by nhs for the base product  additional amounts will be available from centrally available funds for additional products  supplemental trust activity and local configuration 
the letter of intent also contemplates that the interim agreement will provide for a structured set of payments following certain product deliveries  as well as additional payments to csc  which would cover  among other items  various deployments for the named trusts and payments for work already performed 
any payments would be made only if the binding interim agreement is entered into by the parties 
the letter of intent provides that the interim agreement will contain an optional purchase arrangement for those additional trusts other than the committed named trusts that choose to take a deployment of lorenzo 
pricing will be the same as that applicable to the committed named trusts 
the letter of intent provides for an interim lorenzo related standstill arrangement and contemplates that a mutual release of all accrued claims with respect to the lorenzo deployments will be included as part of the interim agreement 
the interim agreement  if agreed  will form the basis of an amendment and restatement of the existing nhs contract to be negotiated by the parties 
entry into the interim agreement  and ultimately the amendment  will require uk government approvals 
there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained 
while the parties intended to conclude a binding interim agreement by march   as previously disclosed  no agreement has yet been reached 
the parties have continued discussions concerning the interim agreement 
the previously disclosed lorenzo related standstill agreement remains in effect through june  there can be no assurance that csc and nhs will enter into the interim agreement or any amendment to the existing agreement or if the parties do not enter into the interim agreement or an amendment by june  that the lorenzo related standstill arrangement will be extended 
likewise  there can be no assurance that if the interim agreement or any amendment are negotiated and entered into  that such documents as finally negotiated will be on terms favorable to csc or as provided in the letter of intent 
the contract has been accounted for using the percentage of completion method based on management s best estimates of total contract revenue and costs 
while software development and deployment activities continue in cooperation with the nhs  because of the december communication rejecting the mou referred to above  the proposals to significantly reduce the scope and value of the lorenzo deployments  and the uncertainty over the results of these negotiations  csc has revised its estimate of revenues and costs at completion under the percentage of completion method to include only those revenues reasonably assured of collection 
as a result of this change in estimate  the company recorded a  million contract charge as of december   including a million reduction of revenue 
this charge included the write off of its work in process balance of  million  billed and unbilled receivables of million and net other assets and liabilities of million  resulting in no material remaining net assets 
while the contract is in a cumulative loss position as of december   an additional forward loss is not evident and has not been accrued  but further losses could be incurred by csc depending on the outcome of negotiations  the terms of any potential agreement  or if no agreement is concluded 
the company is unable to estimate the amount of such additional costs  however  such costs could be material 
in addition  depending on the outcome of the negotiations  it is also reasonably possible that an agreement amending the terms of the nhs contract  if concluded  could result in a payment for the recovery of a portion of the amounts that have been written off as of march  and therefore generate a gain in the near term 
however  there can be no assurance that an agreement with nhs will be concluded  that the terms of any such agreement would be favorable to csc or as provided in the letter of intent  that any gain will be generated in the event such an agreement is concluded or that any recovery will occur 
costs of services settlement charge during the second quarter of fiscal  the company reached a settlement agreement with the us government in its contract claims asserted under the contract disputes act of cda 
under the terms of the settlement  the company received million in cash and a five year extension four base years plus one option year with an estimated total contract value of billion to continue to support and expand the capabilities of the systems covered by the original contract scheduled to expire in december in december  the company signed the contract modification based on the terms described above 
as a result of the settlement  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million during the second quarter of fiscal to write down its claim related assets claim related unbilled receivables of million and deferred costs of million to reflect the cash received of million  the estimated fair value of the contract extension of million  and previously unapplied payments of million 
of the pre tax charge of million  million was recorded as a reduction of revenue and million as a separately itemized charge to cost of services 
the fair value of the contract extension was recorded as a contract asset and will be amortized as a reduction of revenue over the four year fixed contract term in proportion to the expected revenues or a straight line basis  whichever is greater 
the contract extension contained a requirements portion and an indefinite quantity portion and is not subject to any minimum values 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
restructuring costs in march  the company initiated a series of restructuring actions primarily to address excess capacity issues across europe and to align its workforce with current business needs 
in addition to reducing headcount  these actions contemplate increased use of lower cost off shore resources and optimal utilization of facilities  which includes vacating and consolidating office space 
actions under these plans commenced in march and are expected to be carried out through fiscal the restructuring actions envision reduction in the company s workforce by approximately  employees  approximately  of which are in europe  primarily in the uk and in the nordic region  in the united states and the remaining spread across latin america  asia and australia 
a total of million of restructuring costs were accrued in march  which included million of pension benefit augmentations that are due to certain employees in accordance with legal or contractual obligations  and which will be paid out over several years as part of normal pension distributions 
of the total restructuring costs of million  million relates to mss  million to bss  and million to nps 
excluding the pension liability  the remaining million of restructuring liability as of march   includes million expected to be paid in fiscal and million thereafter 
the company expects to incur additional restructuring costs in fiscal of approximately million 
costs of services fiscal costs of services cos  excluding the specified contract charge  the settlement charge  and the restructuring charges  as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal both fiscal and fiscal cos were adversely impacted by out of period adjustments recorded during these years but which were related to prior years 
the amounts recorded in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  in mss and million and million  respectively  in bss 
the fiscal increase in the cos ratio was primarily driven by adverse results in the mss and the bss segments 
the mss cos ratio was impacted by adverse adjustments on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of million of which million was recorded as a reduction of revenue  impairment of tangible and intangible assets of million associated primarily with service delivery issues on certain outsourcing contracts  and start up issues on certain outsourcing contracts  including transition cost overruns of million 
of these specific charges of million  million were recorded in the fourth quarter 
bss cos ratio was adversely impacted primarily by the nhs contract and the financial services business 
subsequent to the billion nhs adjustment recorded in the third quarter and pending the finalization of a contract amendment  the company recorded million of operating losses in the fourth quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  a year over year shift in bss financial services revenue mix  caused by a decline in the proportion of the higher margin license revenue  adversely impacted the bss cos ratio 
bss cos ratio was impacted by adverse adjustments of million on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of which million was recorded as reduction in revenue 
the nps cos ratio increased primarily as a result of recording million of net adverse adjustments on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
the net adjustments included adverse adjustments of million  of which million reduced revenue  and favorable adjustments of million of which million increased revenue 
favorable adjustments included a million cos benefit on a contract that had a similar adjustment in fiscal of the total million net adverse adjustments  million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
fiscal costs of services as a percentage of revenue for fiscal increased to from for fiscal  primarily driven by adverse changes in mss emea and americas operations as well as from a significant adjustment on the nhs contract within the bss segment 
as discussed above  out of period adjustments recorded in mss increased fiscal cos by million and understated the reported fiscal cos by million 
additionally in the nordics region  operational issues including excess staffing capacity  performance issues  and lower revenue also increased the cos ratio in fiscal the mss fiscal cos ratio was further adversely impacted by higher start up and transition expenses on several contracts and a strengthening indian rupee during fiscal which increased costs on us dollar denominated contracts 
selling  general and administrative fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expense  excluding the restructuring charges  as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the fiscal increase was primarily driven by an increase in corporate general administrative g a costs and a higher bss ratio 
the corporate g a costs increased year over year primarily due to higher legal and other fees of million incurred mainly related to the ongoing sec and audit committee investigations into the matters surrounding the out of period adjustments discussed previously 
the company will continue to incur such fees as these investigations are ongoing 
in addition  the company expects to incur additional legal and other professional fees in connection with various putative class action lawsuits that have been filed in federal court see note to the consolidated financial statements 
corporate g a costs were higher also due to costs associated with the former ceo s severance of million 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower bonuses of million and reduced stock compensation expense of million  principally due to reduction in the probable outcome of performance based restricted stock units for certain executives 
the bss ratio increased primarily due to isoft 
isoft s sg a ratio was adversely impacted by million of transaction and transition costs incurred related to its acquisition 
fiscal selling  general and administrative expense improved points to as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal this improvement was driven by reductions in corporate g a costs through lower legal and professional fees  and incentive compensation while the business segments maintained consistent ratios with fiscal depreciation and amortization fiscal depreciation and amortization d a as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the fiscal ratio was driven by all three segments 
the bss ratio increased due to higher amortization expense associated with the acquired isoft intangible and tangible assets 
the higher mss ratio is due to higher capital expenditure on outsourcing contracts 
the higher nps ratio is due to higher fixed asset purchases on certain of its contracts  as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets from fiscal and acquisitions 
fiscal d a decreased points to of revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal lower d a expense in both the mss bss segments were the contributors to this performance reflecting the reducing levels of capital expenditures in fiscal and in line with the company s ongoing program 
interest expense and interest income fiscal interest expense of million in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal due to an increase in capital leases in mss 
interest income increased million to million in fiscal higher interest income was primarily due to higher interest earned on cash balances in india during the first two quarters of fiscal fiscal interest expense of million in fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal the lower interest expense is a result of lower debt levels during fiscal primarily due to the repayment of the million term note in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and repayment of the billion credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal the decrease in interest expense due to repayment of term notes and credit facility was slightly offset by higher interest on increased capital lease activity and interest on borrowings for assets acquired under long term financing primarily in the mss segment 
interest income increased million to million in fiscal due to the combination of increase in interest rates and in foreign cash balances  primarily in india  australia and asia 
other income expense  net the components of other income expense  net for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal are twelve months ended amounts in millions march  april  april  foreign currency loss gain equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates other gains total the company reported other income of million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal foreign currency loss of million for fiscal was due to the movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and the indian rupee  which adversely impacted the company s foreign currency options 
reduction in other gains is due to fiscal gains on sale of an investment and non controlling interest in a business  both of which did not recur in fiscal there was no change in total other income expense from fiscal to fiscal  however  there was a slightly different mix 
foreign currency net gains of million were the result of the effect of currency rate movement primarily between the us dollar and indian rupee  which favorably impacted the company s hedging program 
reduction of equity earnings reflects the disposal of a minority equity shareholding during the year  while the other gains reflect a million gain from the disposal of the minority equity investment  and a gain of million from other minority investments 
the company reported other income of million for fiscal compared with million of other expense in fiscal other gains losses for fiscal primarily includes a gain of million related to sale of the former corporate headquarters facility in el segundo  california  a gain of million from a positive worker s compensation claim experience on a business divested in fiscal  and a million loss related to a building for sale in europe 
taxes the company s effective tax rate etr on loss income from continuing operations for fiscal years   and was   and  respectively 
as a global enterprise  our etr is affected by many factors  including our global mix of earnings  the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states  legislation  acquisitions  dispositions  and tax characteristics of our income 
our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 
the following are the major events that had a significant impact on the etr in fiscal years ended   and in fiscal  the etr was primarily driven by the company recorded a  million charge related to the nhs contract 
following the write down  a full valuation allowance was established against the net operating losses in the uk  which resulted in the company not recording a tax benefit for the nhs charges 
this charge and subsequent valuation allowance had a significant impact on the tax expense and etr of million and  respectively 
the company recorded a  million goodwill impairment charge which was mostly not deductible for tax purposes 
this charge resulted in an impact to the tax expense and etr of million and  respectively 
the company settled various tax examinations and recognized income tax benefits related to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations on audits of approximately million  which had a favorable impact on the etr for the fiscal year of 
the company elected to change the tax status of one of its foreign subsidiaries 
this change in tax status resulted in a deemed liquidation for us tax purposes and triggered various deductions which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately million and had a favorable impact on the etr for the fiscal year of 
in fiscal  the company settled a portion of its us federal income tax audit for the fiscal years through related specifically to research and development r d credits 
this favorable settlement of million had a impact on the etr for the fiscal year ended in fiscal  the company reversed a valuation allowance of million associated with branch net operating loss carryforwards and the remeasurement of an uncertain tax position of million for foreign tax credits as a result of an audit settlement 
these items had a impact on the etr for the fiscal year

a reconciliation of the differences between the us federal statutory rate and the etr  as well as other information about our income tax provision  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the india finance bill of the indian finance bill has been approved by both houses of the indian parliament and  if signed into law  could have an adverse material impact on the company s tax liabilities 
the provisions of the indian finance bill provide for the taxation of indirect foreign investment in india  and would likely be applied retroactively for a period of years prior to the date of enactment subject to the current statute of limitations for tax assessments in india  which is years 
this indian finance bill overrides the recent vodafone ruling by the supreme court of india which held that the indian tax authorities cannot assess capital gains taxes on the sale of shares of non indian companies that indirectly own shares in an indian company 
the retroactive nature of these changes in law has been strongly criticized 
we expect that the indian finance bill will be challenged in the indian courts 
however  there is no assurance that such a challenge will be successful 
csc has engaged in transactions that could be subject to retroactive treatment under the indian finance bill  including the purchase of shares of foreign companies that indirectly own shares of an indian company and internal reorganizations 
the indian tax authorities may seek to apply the provisions of the indian finance bill to these prior transactions and seek to tax csc directly or as a withholding agent or representative assessee of the sellers involved in prior acquisitions 
the company is in the process of determining the amount of the potential exposure  but believes that this amount could be material 
it is the intention of the company to vigorously assert its defenses against any claims raised by the indian tax authorities 
earnings loss per share and share base earnings loss per share eps  on a diluted basis  decreased to in fiscal this decrease in eps was due to net loss attributable to csc common shareholders in fiscal the net loss attributable to csc common shareholders was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of  million recorded during the second and third quarters see note  the contract charge associated with the uk nhs contract of  million recorded during the third quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements  the settlement charge of million that resulted from the settlement of claims with the us federal government during the second quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements  and restructuring costs of million recorded during the fourth quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements 
delivery issues on certain mss and nps contracts resulted in recording forward losses on contracts accounted under the percentage of completion method  and asset impairments which also adversely impacted the eps 
diluted eps for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in net income attributable to csc common shareholders of for fiscal net income attributable to csc common shareholders decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a combination of lower pre tax earnings and higher taxes in fiscal the decrease in eps was also due to an increase in the weighted average common shares and common stock equivalents during the fiscal year due to the year over year appreciation in the company s stock price

cash used in investing activities increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to acquisition of businesses and lower cash received from business dispositions and sale of assets 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to repayment of billion related to the old credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal  net cash from operating activities of  million decreased million as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to higher payroll and related costs primarily due to the fiscal acquisitions  repayment of nhs advance contract payments see note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by receipt of cash upon settlement of claims with the us government see note to the consolidated financial statements and reduced cash taxes 
in fiscal  net cash from operating activities of  million decreased million as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to reduced cash flows from advance contract payments of approximately million  mainly from nhs  offset by higher collections from customers of approximately million  reduced interest and tax payments of million and million  respectively 
the reduced nhs advance contract payments are a result of delays in achieving certain milestones for lorenzo regional care  as well as ongoing contract modification negotiations 
the higher collections and reduced vendor payments are due to timing 
the reduction in cash taxes paid is primarily due to additional pension contributions made in march  which resulted in the company generating a significant overpayment on its fiscal tax return which reduced cash tax payments made during fiscal additionally  the company made a cash payment to settle a tax audit with the german tax authorities during fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal investing cash flow net cash used in investing activities for fiscal of billion increased million compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in payments for business acquisitions of million  and higher expenditures on software of million 
these increases were partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment of million  lower proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million  and lower proceeds from two divestitures of million in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal in fiscal  investing cash outflows increased million compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to increase in payments for business acquisitions of million  higher purchases of property and equipment and corporate assets of million  partially offset by greater proceeds from two divestitures of million and lower cash flow associated with outsourcing contracts of million 
financing cash flow net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  a decrease of  million from fiscal this decrease is primarily due to repayment of billion related to the old credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal  partially offset by higher repayments on capital leases and other long term debt

liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  million at march  and  million at april   and total equity decreased  million to  million during fiscal of the total amount of cash and cash equivalents of  million at march   million was held outside of the us at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was  an increase from at the end of fiscal  and from at the end of fiscal the increase in the debt ratio for fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in total equity associated with the fiscal net loss  driven by the goodwill impairment  the specified contract charges  and other charges and results discussed above 
the following table summarizes the company s debt to total capitalization ratios as of fiscal year end and amount in millions march  april  debt equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization at march   the company had million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks   million of current maturities and  million of long term debt 
the company had no outstanding commercial paper as of march  at april   the company had million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks  million of current maturities and  million of long term debt 
the company had no outstanding commercial paper as of april  on march   the company entered into a new committed line of credit providing billion of long term commercial paper backup which replaced the existing billion line of credit that would have expired on july  the new line of credit expires on march  this line requires the company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted for other non cash charges as defined by the credit agreement ebitda  to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to be less than to  and not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date  to exceed to 
the company is in full compliance with these requirements 
on december   csc s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to billion in share repurchases of the company s outstanding common stock repurchase program 
in fiscal  the company repurchased million shares in the open market for approximately million in accordance with sec rule b the timing  volume  and nature of future share repurchases will be at the discretion of management  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
csc s board has not established an end date for the repurchase program 
the company did not repurchase any shares in fiscal in fiscal  the company continued paying quarterly cash dividends to its common stockholders 
during the year  cash dividends of per share or approximately million were paid out 
the company has sufficient liquidity and expects to continue paying quarterly cash dividends although such payments are subject to continued approval by the board of directors 
the company s total liquidity is comprised of cash and cash equivalents plus any borrowing available under its credit facility 
as of march   the company s total liquidity was approximately billion  consisting of billion of cash and the full billion available under the credit facility 
the company may fund its short term debt obligations through a combination of internally available cash balances  use of its existing billion credit facility and or new borrowings 
continued uncertainty in the global economic conditions may affect the company s business as customers and suppliers may decide to downsize  defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect operating cash flow 
liquidity risk the cash held by the company outside the us is not presently available to fund us operations or obligations without paying taxes upon its repatriation 
it is management s intent to use the foreign cash balances to fund non us acquisitions  capital needs and other cash requirements 
the recent acquisitions of isoft and applabs during the second quarter of fiscal were made with the use of non us cash 
continued uncertainty in the global economic conditions may affect the company s business as customers and suppliers may decide to downsize  defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect operating cash flow 
the company s exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts 
the recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon the company s performance as well as customer acceptance 
the company s ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets is dependent on liquidity in the credit markets as well as the company s financial position 
on march   the company entered into a committed line of credit providing billion of long term commercial paper backup 
this line of credit expires on march  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the company was able to borrow against commercial paper to meet short term liquidity needs 
as of march   there are no borrowings outstanding against commercial paper 
our credit ratings and outlooks are summarized below 
on may   moody s lowered our long term credit rating from baa with a negative watch to baa with a stable outlook 
moody s confirmed its short term rating at prime in december  s p lowered our rating from a to bbb with a negative credit watch 
on may   s p and fitch lowered our credit rating to bbb with a negative outlook 
these changes had no material impact on our current borrowing costs  and we believe they will not have a material impact on our ability to raise further debt financing in the future although the costs of such borrowing would increase 
the ratings and outlooks issued by moody s  s p and fitch appear in the table below rating agency rating outlook fitch bbb negative moody s baa stable s p bbb negative credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and  therefore  the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time 
accordingly  we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above 
factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance  our financial position  resolution of the issues relating to the nhs contract and changes in our business strategy 
if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur  they could impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 
in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities and current cash balances 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the expiration of the company s financial guarantees outstanding as of march  amounts in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total performance guarantees surety bonds letters of credit standby letters of credit foreign subsidiary guarantees total for additional information on off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following table summarizes the company s payments on contractual obligations by period as of march  amounts in millions year or less years years more than years total long term debt interest on fixed rate debt capital lease obligations bank debt operating leases minimum purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined 
regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or the entire shortfall 
during fiscal  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension and million to postretirement benefit plans 
the company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets  which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations 
during fiscal  pension and other pension benefits contributions amounted to million  an increase of million from million in fiscal refer to the critical accounting estimates section later in this md a and to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
dividends during fiscal  quarterly dividends declared aggregated to per share or million 
of the total dividends declared  million was paid in fiscal and the balance of million was paid on april  on may   the board of directors approved a dividend of per share for the quarter ended march   payable on july  to the holders of record of the company s common stock as of the close of business on june  critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues 
changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition  cost estimation and recoverability on long term  fixed price contracts  revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization  capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs  estimates used to determine deferred income taxes  assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill  assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities  and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates 
revenue from our fixed unit price contracts  time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time 
however  for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting  which is approximately percent of the company s revenues  the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation 
under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other input or output based measures are achieved 
costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved 
the method requires estimates of revenues  costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers  program managers and financial professionals 
key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates 
modifications to contract scope  schedule  and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery 
if recovery is deemed probable  we may  as appropriate  either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance 
we routinely negotiate such contract modifications 
many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers 
the total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence tpe or management s best estimate of selling price for the deliverables when vsoe or tpe are not available 
once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements  revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered 
estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume differences  changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 
revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization if significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product  and vsoe is available to support accounting for the software as a separate unit of account  revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above 
thus  cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project  and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results 
capitalization of outsourcing contract costs certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition set up costs  costs associated with installation of systems and processes  and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of assets acquired ie  premiums 
finance staff  working with program management  review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of assets acquired from a customer in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs 
we utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management  operations  procurement and finance areas  as well as third parties on occasion  to determine fair values of assets acquired 
to assess recoverability  undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to contract related assets  including the unamortized deferred cost balance 
such estimates require judgment and assumptions  which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel 
key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies 
a significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
for internal use software  the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis 
to assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs  we must estimate future revenue  costs and cash flows 
such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows  and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 
estimates used to determine income tax expense we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must analyze income tax reserves  as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained under examination 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments in determination of acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining their fair values 
independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations can be based on significant estimates provided by the company  such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by company professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other disciplines 
additional information obtained during the allocation period related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could result in material impacts to earnings 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with asc fas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and reductions in growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  no further procedures are required 
however  if a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  an impairment of goodwill may exist  requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in this step  the reporting unit s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business acquisition 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method in which the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for each reporting unit are discounted to a present value using a discount rate 
cash flow projections are based on management s estimates of economic and market conditions which drive key assumptions of revenue growth rates  operating margins  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the discount rate in turn is based on the specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit  the weighted average cost of capital and its underlying forecast 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying performance metric multiples to the reporting unit s prior and expected operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit derived using the income approach is significantly different from the fair value estimate using the market approach  the company reevaluates its assumptions used in the two models 
the fair values determined by the market approach and income approach  as described above  are weighted to determine the fair value for each reporting unit 
the weighted values assigned to each reporting unit are primarily driven by two factors the number of comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach  and the similarity of the operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units to the comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach 
in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values  the company also compares the sum of the reporting units fair values to its market capitalization per share stock price times shares outstanding and calculates an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization 
the company evaluates the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable transactions 
if the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions  the company will reevaluate its fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and or other assumptions 
as a result  when csc s stock price is low  this reevaluation can result in lower estimated fair values of the reporting units 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates  operating margins  terminal growth rates  capital expenditures  as well as discount rates 
estimates involve the assessment of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
in addition  judgments and assumptions are required for allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of each reporting unit 
although we have consistently used the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain and can vary from actual results 
assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities we offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by asc compensation retirement benefits for fiscal   and to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
we consider current market conditions such as changes in interest rates  in determining discount rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns on pension and postretirement plan assets 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the asset mix of the plan and other factors 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
the weighted average of the expected long term rate of return  for all pension plans  on plan assets utilized for the fiscal and pension plan valuations was and  respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the fiscal net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension and postretirement plan actuarial valuation 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
the weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal net periodic pension cost was compared to used for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the fiscal net periodic pension cost by approximately million  or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts 
the accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur 
for example  while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns  differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year 
such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized into earnings over time 
during fiscal and  the actual return on assets exceeded the expected return on assets  producing an actuarial gain 
however  offsetting this actuarial gain was an actuarial loss increasing the projected benefit obligation of the company s pension plans primarily due to the decline in discount rates 
as a result  pension assets as a percentage of projected benefit obligations decreased during the fiscal year 
assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising in the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
csc consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with asc contingencies 
significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
for the year ended march   a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial conditions 
foreign currency as a large global organization the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenue is received  and any related short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
thus  by generally matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company is able to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency risk to earnings 
however  as the company has increased its use of offshore support in recent years  it has become more exposed to currency fluctuations 
the company has policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using foreign currency forwards to hedge intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities 
for accounting purposes  these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and thus all changes in fair value are reported in net earnings as part of other income expense 
the company also uses foreign currency options to manage its exposure to economic risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations 
these financial instruments are generally short term in nature with typical maturities of less than one year 
they are used to offset existing foreign currency positions or as economic hedges and not for speculative or trading purposes 
during fiscal  approximately of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
the company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of movement in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings 
for the year ended march   a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would have impacted revenue by approximately or million  while a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by approximately million for the year ended march  this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
as of march   the company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents outside of the us and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
