item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of items  uncertainties  assumptions and risks associated with these statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following workers compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries  vehicular collisions  accidents and cargo damage 
we are substantially self insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 
certain insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim 
we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 
for periods prior to january   certain policies include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of months from each policy period inception 
this contractual premium adjustment factor is used to convert the self insured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims 
for periods beginning january   our personal injury and property damage policies no longer include these premium adjustment factors  and the claim liability remains with us for the life of the claim 
the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on measurement dates  policy expiration dates and claim type 
during  we were self insured for  per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and million for workers compensation 
for and  we were self insured for  per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for substantially all workers compensation claims 
we have renewed our policies for with substantially the same terms as our policies for personal injury  property damage and workers compensation 
our claims accrual policy for all self insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as legal  economic and regulatory factors 
our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim 
the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature  timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available 
accordingly  we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability 
this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above  if applicable 
in doing so  the recorded liability considers future claims growth and  if applicable  conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
we do not discount our estimated losses 
at december   we had an accrual of approximately million for estimated claims 
in addition  we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums 
at december   we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately million  which represented prefunded premiums 
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors  trucks  containers and trailers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements 
in addition  we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under short term rental arrangements 
revenue equipment that is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december  we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or trade in values for certain new equipment 
we have utilized these trade in values  as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles  in accounting for depreciation expense 
if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for trade in values  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided 
accordingly  a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor  we are a principal in the transaction  we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks  and we maintain discretion over pricing 
additionally  we are responsible for the selection of third party transportation providers 
our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience  as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility 
the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings 
deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the more likely than not threshold  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 
significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax related contingencies on our provision for income taxes 
as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes  we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements 
such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments  whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates 
further  a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved 
see note  income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 
year in review our net earnings of million  or per diluted share  were up from the million  or per diluted share  earned in the increase in earnings was due to all four business segments reporting increased operating income compared with our jbi and dcs segments  combined  represented of the million increase in consolidated operating income  to million in from million in higher load count  improved pricing and continued focus on cost reduction practices provided benefit throughout our response to changing market conditions and a continued focus on growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital enabled us to take advantage of load volume recovery in our consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was  compared with in significant events for calendar year include reported record revenue of billion  record net earnings of million  and record earnings per share of purchased million shares of our outstanding common stock  and our board of directors authorized an additional purchase of up to million of our common stock replaced our million senior revolving credit facility with a new million credit agreement to provide a revolving line of credit for a five year term  with proceeds used for equipment purchases  repurchase of our common stock and other working capital purposes issued a million variable rate senior term loan maturing in  with proceeds used for existing indebtedness payments and general working capital purposes increased our quarterly dividend to per share in january from in  and announced an increase to per share effective february results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of percentage change operating revenues between years vs 
vs 
operating revenues operating expenses rents and purchased transportation salaries  wages and employee benefits fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims general and administrative expenses  net of asset dispositions operating taxes and licenses communication and utilities total operating expenses operating income net interest expense equity in operations of affiliated company earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings compared with consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues were billion in  a increase over significantly higher fuel prices and increased load volume resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of million in  compared with million in if fsc revenues were excluded from both years  our revenue increased over revenue in all operating segments increased over  with consolidated load growth and rate improvements contributing to the increase in revenues 
consolidated operating expenses our consolidated operating expenses increased from  compared to the increase in revenue year over year 
this combination resulted in an improvement in our operating ratio to from in rents and purchased transportation costs increased in this increase was the result of higher rates paid and the higher price of fuel  since fuel costs of third party rail and truck carriers are included in purchased transportation expense  as well as an increase in load volume that increased services from these third party rail and truck carriers 
the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits increased in from this increase primarily related to increases in driver and other labor pay due to increased business demand 
additionally  we previously reactivated and increased certain compensation and benefit programs  which contributed to the increase over the prior year 
fuel and fuel taxes expense increased in  primarily due to a higher fuel cost per gallon and higher load volume 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers 
these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national  regional or local fuel prices 
while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly  most also reflect a specified miles per gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue 
as a result  some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues 
due to these programs  this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense  or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads  dray carriers and other third parties 
these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in  primarily due to additions to our container and chassis fleet to support additional business demand  as well as truck and tractor growth and trades 
operating supplies and expenses increased  primarily due to toll and tire expenses related to increased activity and increased miles 
insurance and claims expense decreased for  primarily due to reduced accident severity 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in charitable contributions and an increase in gains from asset dispositions  partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense due to a customer bankruptcy and additional expense related to severance agreements for executive retirees 
net gains from sale of revenue equipment were million in  compared with million in net interest expense for increased by compared with this increase was primarily due to an increase in debt levels  partially offset by lower interest rates 
our effective income tax rate was in and in the increase in was primarily related to an increase in state tax rates 
we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the range of to for calendar year segments we operated four business segments during calendar year the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment operating revenue by segment years ended december  in millions jbi dcs jbt ics total segment revenues intersegment eliminations total    operating income loss by segment years ended december  in millions jbi dcs jbt ics total includes pretax charges to write down the value of certain assets held for sale as follows million for jbi in  million for dcs in operating data by segment years ended december  jbi loads average length of haul miles revenue per load average tractors during the period tractors end of period company owned independent contractor total tractors trailing equipment end of period average effective trailing equipment usage dcs loads average length of haul miles revenue per truck per week average trucks during the period trucks end of period company owned independent contractor customer owned dedicated operated total trucks trailing equipment end of period average effective trailing equipment usage jbt loads average length of haul miles loaded miles total miles average nonpaid empty miles per load revenue per tractor per week average tractors during the period tractors end of period company owned independent contractor total tractors trailing equipment end of period average effective trailing equipment usage ics loads revenue per load gross profit margin employee count end of period approximate number of third party carriers end of period includes company owned and independent contractor tractors using weighted workdays includes company owned  independent contractor  and customer owned trucks jbi segment jbi segment revenue increased to billion in  from billion in  primarily due to a increase in load volume and a increase in rates 
operating income in our jbi segment increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to volume growth and price increases 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue increased to billion in  from million in revenue  excluding fuel surcharges  increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase in productivity and truck count as a result of new contracts awarded 
operating income increased to million in  compared with million in this increase was due to reductions in insurance and claims costs  the transfer of assets to more profitable accounts  improved cost controls and new contracts awarded 
jbt segment jbt segment revenue increased to million in  from million in revenue  excluding fuel surcharges  remained relatively flat in compared to increases in rates were offset by a reduction in average tractor count and reduced load volume 
jbt segment had operating income of million in  compared with million in this was mainly a result of increased rates  and gains on equipment disposals  partially offset by increases in driver compensation during ics segment ics segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in load volume and higher pricing in both contractual and transactional business and an increase in the cost of fuel 
operating income increased to million in  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to increased revenues  lower overhead costs  and operating leverage gained from a more experienced workforce 
compared with consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues were billion in  an increase over significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of million in  compared with million in if fsc revenues were excluded from both years  our revenue increased over revenue in all operating segments increased over  with consolidated load growth and rate improvements contributing to the increase in revenues 
consolidated operating expenses our consolidated operating expenses increased from the impact of this increase  and the increase in revenue from  resulted in an improvement in our operating ratio to from in rents and purchased transportation costs increased in  as a result of higher load volume  which increased services from these third party rail and truck carriers 
in addition  the higher price of fuel contributed to the increase in rents and purchased transportation costs  since fuel costs of third party rail and truck carriers are included in purchased transportation expense 
the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits increased in from this increase was related to increases in driver and other labor pay due to increased business demand and the increase in final mile delivery service business compared with a year ago 
in addition  we were able to reactivate and increase certain compensation and benefit programs for all of our employees in fuel and fuel taxes expense increased in  primarily due to a higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers 
these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national  regional or local fuel prices 
while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly  most also reflect a specified miles per gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue 
as a result  some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues 
due to these programs  this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense  or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads  dray carriers and other third parties 
these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in  primarily due to additions to our jbi and dcs segments for power and trailing equipment in support of additional business demand 
insurance and claims expense decreased for  due to fewer cargo claim incidents and a lower cost per claim for casualty 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the pretax write down of million recorded in related to assets held for sale 
this decrease was offset by increases in a charitable contribution and building rental expense 
in addition  included a gain on asset sales of million  compared with losses on asset sales of million in net interest expense for increased by compared with this increase was primarily due to increased outstanding debt balances  offset slightly by reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt 
the equity in operations of affiliated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of transplace  inc tpi 
the change from is due to the sale of our interests in see note  affiliated company  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions 
our effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in was primarily related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the impact in of the sale of our interests in tpi 
jbi segment jbi segment revenue increased to billion in  from billion in a significant portion of this increase in revenue related to the increase in load volume and improvement in revenue per load compared with operating income in our jbi segment increased to million in  from million in increased equipment utilization and higher revenues resulted in the operating income increase over dcs segment dcs segment revenue increased to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in productivity and truck counts  primarily related to growth in delivery and replenishment business 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the capacity business 
operating income increased to million in  compared with million in this increase in operating income was due to the increased revenue and the improved leverage gained from those higher revenues 
jbt segment jbt segment revenue increased to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily the result of increases in rates and longer lengths of haul compared with our jbt segment had operating income of million in  compared with an operating loss of million in this was mainly a result of increased rates and the impact of our network refinement and tractor fleet count reduction  which allowed for effective cost control measures 
ics segment ics segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in load volume and higher pricing in both contractual and transactional business 
operating income decreased to million in  compared with million in the decrease primarily relates to higher transportation costs and fuel prices  as well as new branch location costs 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities relative to  after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation  share based compensation and deferred income taxes  was primarily due to increased earnings  the timing of payments related to trade accounts payable  and the collection of income taxes receivable 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash flows related to trade receivables  due to timing of receipts 
cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to additions to our revenue equipment fleet  net of proceeds from disposals 
the higher level of cash used for equipment additions during was associated with growth in the container and chassis fleet  as well as truck and tractor growth and trades 
net cash used in financing activities during decreased from  primarily due to fewer repayments on our revolving lines of credit  a slight decrease in our treasury stock repurchases  and increased borrowings from our revolving lines of credit in  offset by an increase in dividends paid 
our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition  earnings  capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 
we paid an per share quarterly dividend in  a per share quarterly dividend in  and a per share quarterly dividend in on february   we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from to  which was paid on february  we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
however  no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 
liquidity our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers and chassis  trucks  tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment 
we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions 
we have  during the past few years  obtained capital through cash generated from operations  revolving lines of credit and long term debt issuances 
we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment 
on march   we entered into a three year  unsecured million variable rate senior term loan agreement  which matures in march proceeds were used for existing indebtedness payments and general working capital purposes 
we are required to make an installment payment of million in march  with the remaining million payable at maturity 
the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate  the federal funds rate or libor  depending upon the specific type of borrowing  plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees 
at december   we had million outstanding under this variable rate senior term loan facility at an interest rate of 
on august   we replaced our million senior revolving credit facility dated march   with a new credit facility authorizing us to borrow up to million under a senior revolving line of credit  which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks 
this new senior credit facility  which has a five year term expiring in august  allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to million and to request a one year extension of the maturity date 
the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate  the federal funds rate or libor  depending upon the specific type of borrowing  plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees 
at december   we had million outstanding at an average interest rate of under this agreement 
at december   our senior notes consist of two separate issuances 
the first is million of senior notes  which mature in july principal payments in the amount of million are due in july and  with the remainder due upon maturity 
interest payments are due semiannually in january and july of each year 
the second is million of senior notes  which mature september  with interest payments due semiannually in march and september of each year 
we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture 
million of senior notes matured and were paid on march  our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december  we believe our liquid assets  cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our debt to equity ratio increased from  due to an increase in debt related to the current year issuance and a reduction in equity due to the share repurchase program 
we are currently committed to spend approximately million  net of proceeds from sales or trade ins during  which is primarily related to containers and chassis 
off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases 
as of december   we had approximately million of obligations  primarily related to facilities leases 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december  total and thereafter operating leases long term debt obligations interest payments on debt commitments to acquire revenue equipment and facilities total interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december  we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately million at december   that expire at various dates in fiscal year  which are related to certain operating agreements and our self insured retention levels for casualty and workers compensation claims 
we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our third party agreements 
the table above excludes million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near term adverse increase in short term interest rates on variable rate debt outstanding 
of our total million of debt  we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   under our revolving lines of credit and our senior term loan 
these have variable interest rates  which are based on the prime rate  the federal funds rate or libor  depending upon the specific type of borrowing  plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees 
our earnings would be affected by changes in these short term variable interest rates 
at our current level of borrowing  a one percentage point increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by million 
our remaining debt is fixed rate debt  and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense 
periodically  we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates  however  at december   we had no such derivative financial instruments in place 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
