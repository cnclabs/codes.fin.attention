item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and manufacture products primarily for medical applications 
we market components to other equipment manufacturers for incorporation in their products and sell finished devices to physicians  hospitals  clinics and other treatment centers 
our medical products primarily serve the fluid delivery  cardiovascular  and ophthalmology markets 
our other medical and non medical products include instrumentation and disposables used in dialysis and valves and inflation devices used in marine and aviation safety products 
in approximately percent of our sales were outside the united states 
our products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers 
we encounter competition in all of our markets and compete primarily on the basis of product quality  price  engineering  customer service and delivery time 
our strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas of our expertise 
research and development efforts are focused on improving current products and developing highly engineered products that meet customer needs in niche markets that are large enough to provide meaningful increases in sales 
proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable 
we also focus on controlling costs by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes 
we have been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and have used that cash to reduce indebtedness  to fund capital expenditures  to make investment purchases  to repurchase stock and to pay dividends 
our strategic objective is to further enhance our position in our served markets by focusing on customer needs  expanding existing product lines and developing new products  maintaining a culture of controlling cost  and preserving and fostering a collaborative  entrepreneurial management structure

revenues were million in  compared with million in and million in the percent revenue increases in over and in over were generally attributable to higher sales volumes 
annual revenues by product lines were as follows in thousands fluid delivery cardiovascular ophthalmology other total our cost of goods sold was million in each of and and million in increased sales volume  increased material costs  and increased manufacturing overhead costs were the primary contributors to the percent increase in cost of goods sold for over gross profit in increased million to million  compared with million in and million in our gross profit was percent of revenues in  percent of revenues in and percent of revenues in the increases in gross profit percentage in each of and from the prior year were primarily due to a favorable product mix  improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of cost savings projects 
operating expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in in increases in general and administrative  or g a  expenses and increases in research and development  or r d  expenses were partially offset by decreases in selling expenses 
g a expenses increased million in as compared to primarily related to increased compensation and increased outside services 
g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative  executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees 
r d expenses increased  in as compared to primarily related to increased compensation costs  increased supplies costs and increased outside services 
r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of our r d personnel as well as costs associated with regulatory matters

our interest income for was million compared with million in and  in the increases in and were primarily related to the increased level of cash and investments during and results for and were also favorably impacted by investing in bonds with slightly longer maturities and higher yields 
income tax expense in totaled million  compared with million in and million in the effective tax rates for  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
benefits from tax incentives for domestic production totaled  in   in and  in benefits from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled  in expenses from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled  in and  in we expect our effective tax rate for to be approximately percent 
in february  we learned that a large customer with which we have a long term contract had accumulated too large of an inventory of one of our products  which we anticipate will result in a significant reduction in shipments to that customer in due to this and other factors  we expect our earnings for the full year of to decline by approximately percent from levels 
we believe that the bulk of this decline will occur in the first two quarters of we expect our earnings per share to return to double digit annual growth in liquidity and capital resources effective october   our revolving credit facility with a money center bank was amended to increase the maximum principal amount of our revolving line of credit from million to million and to extend the termination date for advances under the revolving line of credit to october  the credit facility is to be utilized for the funding of operations and for major capital projects or acquisitions  subject to certain limitations and restrictions 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest that is payable monthly at day  day or day libor  as selected by us  plus one percent 
from time to time prior to october  and assuming an event of default is not then existing  we can convert outstanding advances under the revolving line of credit to term loans with a term of up to two years 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at december  or at december  the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
we believe that the bank providing the credit facility is highly rated and that the entire million under the credit facility is currently available to us 
if that bank were unable to provide such funds  we believe that such inability would not impact our ability to fund operations 
at december   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  an increase of million from december  the principal contributor to this increase was the cash generated by operating activities  which was partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property  plant and equipment and the payment of dividends 
cash flows provided by operations of million in were primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non cash expenses less net changes in working capital items 
inventories were the primary contributors to the negative net change in working capital items 
the change in inventories was primarily related to increased stocking levels necessary to mitigate a supplier risk  to assure uninterrupted deliveries and to ensure high customer service levels 
in addition  in late we rescheduled a shipment from late until early at the request of a large customer with which we have a long term contract 
in february we learned that this customer had accumulated too large an inventory of one of our products  which we anticipate will result in a significant reduction in shipments to that customer 
at december   we had working capital of million  including million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
the million increase in working capital during was primarily related to increases in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and inventories partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the net increase in cash and short term investments was primarily related to amounts generated from operations 
working capital items consisted primarily of cash  accounts receivable  short term investments  inventories and other current assets minus accounts payable  and other current liabilities 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million in  compared with million in and million in these expenditures were primarily for the addition of machinery and equipment 
we expect capital expenditures  primarily machinery and equipment  to increase substantially over the average of the levels expended during each of the past three years 
we paid cash dividends totaling million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in january  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share on our outstanding common stock 
this dividend which totaled million was paid on january  in december  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share on our outstanding common stock 
this dividend which totaled million was paid on december  we expect to fund future dividend payments with cash flows from operations 
the table below summarizes debt  lease and other contractual obligations outstanding at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter in thousands purchase obligations total in the current credit and financial markets  many companies are finding it difficult to gain access to capital resources 
in spite of the current economic conditions  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  cash flows from operations and available borrowings of up to million under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the foreseeable future 
we believe that our strong financial position would allow us to access equity or debt financing should that be necessary 
additionally  we expect that our cash and cash equivalents and investments  as a whole  will continue to increase in off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
impact of inflation we experience the effects of inflation primarily in the prices we pay for labor  materials and services 
over the last three years  we have experienced the effects of moderate inflation in these costs 
at times  we have been able to offset a portion of these increased costs by increasing the sales prices of our products 
however  competitive pressures have not allowed for full recovery of these cost increases 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance in asc intangibles goodwill and other intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as having a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we have chosen to adopt this standard as of december   and it had no effect on our financial statements 
from time to time  new accounting standards updates applicable to us are issued by the fasb  which we will adopt as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe the impact of recently issued standards updates that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
from time to time  we accrue legal costs associated with certain litigation 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law and other case specific issues 
we believe these accruals are adequate to cover the legal fees and expenses associated with litigating these matters 
however  the time and cost required to litigate these matters as well as the outcomes of the proceedings may vary from what we have projected 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments 
on an ongoing basis  the collectability of accounts receivable is assessed based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of specific accounts and determine when to grant credit to our customers using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition  recent payment history  current economic environment  and discussions with our personnel and with the customers directly 
accounts are written off when it is determined the receivable will not be collected 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the collectability of amounts could be changed by a material amount 
we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and uncertain tax positions in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not  do not establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
we assess the impairment of our long lived identifiable assets  excluding goodwill which is tested for impairment as explained below  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows 
although we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows or future changes in our business plan could materially affect our evaluations 
no such changes are anticipated at this time 
we assess goodwill for impairment pursuant to asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which requires that goodwill be assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis by applying a fair value test 
during  and  none of our critical accounting policy estimates required significant adjustments 
we did not note any material events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of long lived assets were not recoverable 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks foreign exchange risk we are not exposed to material fluctuations in currency exchange rates because the payments from our international customers are received primarily in united states dollars 
principal and interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments consist of money market accounts and taxable high grade corporate bonds 
our investment policy is to seek to manage these assets to achieve the goal of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to established investment guidelines 
in general  the primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of and the return on the investment to fluctuate 
in recent years  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  and investments do not have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
however  our cash equivalents and investments may be subject to adverse changes in market value 
forward looking statements statements in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this form k that are forward looking are based upon current expectations  and actual results or future events may differ materially 
therefore  the inclusion of such forward looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us that our objectives or plans will be achieved 
such statements include  but are not limited to  our expectations regarding our research and development expenditures in  our effective tax rate  our ability to obtain component parts in the event of a supply disruption  shipments in to a large customer which had excess inventory at the end of  earnings in  a return to double digit annual growth in earnings per share in  our capital expenditures  funding future dividend payments with cash flows from operations  availability of equity and debt financing  our ability to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  our ability to fund operations if the bank providing our credit facility were unable to lend funds to us  the impact on our consolidated financial statement of recently issued accounting standards when we adopt those standards  and increases in in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
words such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends  should  plans  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements contained herein involve numerous risks and uncertainties  and there are a number of factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ materially  including  but not limited to  the following changing economic  market and business conditions  acts of war or terrorism  the effects of governmental regulation  the impact of competition and new technologies  slower than anticipated introduction of new products or implementation of marketing strategies  implementation of new manufacturing processes or implementation of new information systems  our ability to protect our intellectual property  changes in the prices of raw materials  changes in product mix  intellectual property and product liability claims and product recalls  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and the loss of any significant customers 
in addition  assumptions relating to budgeting  marketing  product development and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic review which may cause us to alter our marketing  capital expenditures or other budgets  which in turn may affect our results of operations and financial condition
