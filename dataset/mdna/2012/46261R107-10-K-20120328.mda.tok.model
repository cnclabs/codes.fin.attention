overview we currently operate retail stores  including in new england  including our new store in manchester  ct  and our reopened store in west lebanon  nh  and five in florida 
we also operated eleven temporary halloween stores in  which is consistent with the number of temporary stores we operated in and  more than twice as many as in during  the us economy continued its emergence from the deep recession of with some improvements seen in stock market price levels and unemployment 
these factors contributed to an improvement in the overall retail environment 
however  our sales and profit performance in were negatively affected by two significant weather events 
tropical storm irene struck in late august  which caused significant damage to our west lebanon new hampshire store 
the store was closed from the date of the storm until its reopening in january  more importantly  the new england region experienced an early season nor easter snow storm on the saturday before halloween  our most important retail season 
eleven of our stores were without power for almost a week 
sales levels at our stores that remained open were severely reduced due to the storm related disruption in our customers daily lives and shopping patterns 
we ended fiscal with approximately million in sales for the week year  a decrease of from the prior week year  and we reported a net loss of approximately million as compared to net income of thousand in comparable store sales in decreased compared to sales in from a positive in fiscal when compared to comparable store sales are defined as sales from those stores open for at least one full year 
for the first quarter of  our consolidated revenues were million  compared to million for the first quarter of  despite the shift in easter to the second quarter of and the severe winter weather in new england that shortened our number of sale days in the first quarter of the increase in first quarter revenues from the year ago period included a decrease in comparable store sales sales from stores open more than one year 
the increase in consolidated revenue was primarily due to the increase in sales from our new store in the south bay center and increased sales from our boylston street store  both in boston  massachusetts 
consolidated gross profit margin was for the first quarter of compared to a margin of for the same period in the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the reversal of an inventory provision recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well to increased initial product profit margins 
the consolidated net loss for the first quarter of was million  or per share  compared to consolidated net loss of million  or per share  for the first quarter in for the second quarter of  our consolidated revenues were million  compared to million for the second quarter of the decrease in second quarter revenues from the year ago period included a decrease in comparable store sales 
the decrease in consolidated revenue was primarily due to the decrease in sales from novelty wrist bands  which experienced a brief period of strong popularity in the spring and summer of  that were not replaced by another novelty item or popular licensed goods in  and the effect on the business from the slow economic recovery and spike in gas prices during the first half of partially offsetting the lack of replacement sales were increased sales from our new stores in the south bay center  boston  ma and in manchester  ct and improved performance in some of our seasonal categories 
consolidated gross profit margin was for the second quarter of compared to a margin of for the same period in the lower gross profit margin was primarily due to decreased leveraging of occupancy costs based on the decline in same store sales  which was partly offset by increased product selling margins 
the consolidated net profit for the second quarter of was thousand  or per share  compared to thousand  or per share  for the second quarter of for the third quarter of  our consolidated revenues were million  compared to million for the third quarter of the decrease in third quarter revenues from the year ago period included a decrease in comparable store sales 
the decrease in consolidated revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in customer traffic and resulting decrease in sales transactions during the third quarter of we believe that the decrease in customer traffic was partly due to the decrease in sales of novelty wrist bands 
these sales decreases were partially offset by increased sales from our new stores in the south bay center  boston  and in manchester  connecticut 
consolidated gross profit margin was for the third quarter of compared to a gross profit margin of for the same period in the lower gross profit margin was primarily due to decreased leveraging of occupancy costs based on the decline in same store sales  as well as by decreased product selling margins 
the consolidated net loss for the third quarter of was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the third quarter of we suffered a casualty loss at our west lebanon  nh store on august  due to severe flooding of the connecticut river  caused by tropical storm irene 
inventory in the amount of  was destroyed  the majority of the inventory in the store at the time of the flood 
we incurred another  in restoration and recovery expenses 
the inventory loss and recovery expenses were reflected in our third quarter results 
the loss was not covered by insurance 
we closed the store for repairs and reopened the store in january on november   we reported sales results for the calendar month and year  and for the fiscal month and year  ended october for the thirty one day calendar month of october  consolidated revenues were million  a decrease of compared to the same period in sales at comparable stores decreased for the calendar month compared to the same period in for the five week fiscal month of october  which ended on october th  consolidated revenues decreased by compared to the same fiscal month period in sales at comparable stores decreased for the fiscal month compared to fiscal october the decrease in consolidated revenues for the calendar and fiscal months of october was substantially caused by the early season nor easter that disrupted business and closed several of our stores in the most important week of the halloween selling season 
overall  we experienced a decrease in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter  including the october results noted above 
total sales increased in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of this increase included sales of million for the rd week of consolidated gross profit margin was for the fourth quarter of compared to a gross profit margin of for the same period in  due primarily to increased leveraging of occupancy costs based on the additional rd week of sales in for the quarter  our net income was million  compared to million in the fourth quarter of the increase in net income for the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of was primarily due to the extra week in the quarter due to the week fiscal year  offset by the storm related sales and profit shortfalls in october

for the year ended dec  dec  cost of products sold and occupancy costs percentage of revenues as a percentage of revenues  the increase in cost of products sold was primarily attributable to decreased leveraging of occupancy costs against the decrease in same store sales 
the effect of this leveraging shortfall was partly offset by better product selling margins

there was no interest expense related to notes payable in interest expense related to notes payable in was  this decrease was primarily due to the payoff of the party city note balance of  on august  the effective interest rate on the party city note was 
income taxes in  our income tax expense was  which principally relates to current state income taxes that are partially offset by a deferred tax benefit based on our estimates of future book and taxable income 
our provision for current state taxes exceeds the average statutory rate net of federal tax benefit because of permanent and temporary differences between taxable and book income  including amounts associated with stock based compensation expense  depreciation  and amortization of intangibles and common stock warrants 
the net deferred tax benefit of  included an increase in the related valuation allowance of  which was based on our estimates of fiscal and future book and tax income

the net deferred tax benefit of  resulted from the release of a portion of our deferred tax valuation reserves  which was based on our estimates of future book and tax income 
we were able to utilize approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in at the end of  we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations based upon certain ownership changes of our stock that may have occurred or that may occur

net income our net income in was  or net income per basic and diluted share  compared to net income of  or net income per basic and diluted share in critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
inventories our inventories consist of party supplies and are valued at the lower of moving weighted average cost or market which approximates fifo first in  first out 
we record vendor rebates  discounts and certain other adjustments to inventory  including freight costs  and we recognize these amounts in the income statement as the related goods are sold 
during each interim reporting period  we estimate the impact on cost of products sold associated with inventory shortage 
the actual inventory shortage is determined upon reconciliation of the annual physical inventory  which occurs shortly before our year end  and an adjustment to cost of products sold is recorded at the end of the fourth quarter to recognize the difference between the estimated and actual inventory shortage for the full year 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
revenue recognition revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
we estimate returns based upon historical return rates and such amounts have not been significant 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of the values of two non compete agreements acquired in conjunction with the purchase of retail stores in and  and the values of retail store leases acquired in those transactions 
the first non compete agreement  from party city corporation and its affiliates  covers massachusetts  maine  new hampshire  vermont  rhode island  and windsor and new london counties in connecticut 
this non compete agreement had an original estimated life of months 
the expiration date of this non compete agreement was extended from august  to december  in conjunction with the company s agreement with party city corporation to take over their location in manchester  connecticut 
the second non compete agreement was acquired in connection with our purchase in january of two franchised party supply stores in lincoln and warwick  rhode island 
the acquired rhode island stores had been operated as party city franchise stores  and were converted to iparty stores immediately following the closing 
the second non compete agreement covers rhode island for five years from the date of closing and within a certain distance from our stores in the rest of new england for three years 
the second non compete agreement has an estimated life of months 
both non compete agreements are subject to certain terms and conditions in their respective acquisition agreements 
the occupancy valuations related to acquired retail store leases are for stores in peabody  massachusetts estimated life of months  lincoln  rhode island estimated life of months and warwick  rhode island estimated life of months 
intangible assets also include legal and other transaction costs incurred related to the purchase of the peabody  lincoln and warwick stores 
non compete agreements are amortized based on the pattern of their expected cash flow benefits 
occupancy valuations are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
impairment of long lived assets in connection with our ongoing long lived asset assessment  we perform a review of each store for impairment indicators whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable from estimated future store cash flows 
our review considers store operating results  future sales growth and cash flows 
the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from current estimates if underlying assumptions or business strategies change 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that one of our retail stores was impaired due to underperforming sales 
as a result of this impairment  we recorded a charge of approximately  to reduce to fair value the carrying value of the property and equipment utilized in this store 
we are not aware of any impairment indicators for any of our remaining stores at december  income taxes historically  we have not recognized an income tax benefit for our losses 
accordingly  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of future taxable income and the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in determining if a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset is appropriate  we consider both positive and negative evidence 
the positive evidence that we considered included we were profitable in   and  we have achieved positive comparable store sales growth for six out of the last nine years  we were able to significantly reduce store and headquarters operating expenses in  and we were able to use federal net operating loss deductions in each tax year from through the negative evidence that we considered included we realized a net loss in  and  our merchandise margins decreased in    and  our future profitability is vulnerable to certain risks  including a the risk that we may not be able to generate significant taxable income to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december   b the risk of unseasonable weather and other factors in a single geographic region  new england  where our stores are concentrated  c the risk of being so dependent upon a single season  halloween  for a significant amount of annual sales and profitability and d the risk of fluctuating prices for petroleum products  which are a key raw material for much of our merchandise and which affect our freight costs and those of our suppliers and affect our customers spending levels and patterns  the costs that opening or acquiring new stores will put pressure on our profit margins until these stores reach maturity  the expected increasing costs of regulatory compliance  will likely have a negative impact on our profitability  and the risk that a continued  general or perceived slowdown in the u 
s economy  or uncertainty as to the economic outlook  which the us and world economies have recently experienced  could continue to reduce discretionary spending or cause a shift in consumer discretionary spending to other products 
the positive evidence is strong enough for us to conclude that we will realize sufficient levels of taxable income in and beyond to support the net deferred tax asset value of approximately thousand at year end however  we believe that it is prudent for us to maintain a valuation allowance against our remaining deferred tax assets until we have a longer history of profitability and we can reduce our exposure to the risks described above 
should we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would increase income in the period we made such a determination 
stock option compensation expense we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based compensation 
the black scholes model requires us to make several subjective assumptions  including the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  which is based on historical volatility of our common stock over a time period equal to the expected term 
the black scholes model also requires a risk free interest rate  which is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and the dividend yield on our common stock  which is assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each grant 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from our estimates

liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  including purchases under our supply agreement with amscan  as described more fully below  occupancy expenses of our stores  employee salaries  and new and temporary store openings  including acquisitions 
our primary sources of cash are cash from operating activities  and debt under our facility 
our prospective cash flows are subject to certain trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  including store acquisitions and openings and our e commerce site  finance inventory purchases  improve our infrastructure  respond to economic conditions  and meet contractual commitments 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that anticipated revenues from operations and borrowings available under our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital requirements and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
in the event that our operating plan changes due to changes in our strategic plans  lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses  increased competition  unfavorable economic conditions  declines in consumer confidence and spending  or other unforeseen circumstances  our liquidity may be negatively impacted 
if so  we could be required to adjust our expenditures for to conserve working capital or raise additional capital  possibly including debt or equity financing to fund operations and our business strategy 
given the current state of the debt and equity markets and our existing capital structure  this could be difficult and expensive  and we might not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us 
notes payable we had three notes payable that were entered into in fiscal  the last of which was paid off in the highbridge note was a subordinated note in the stated principal amount of  that bore interest at the prime rate plus one percent 
the highbridge note was part of a financing transaction that raised million through a combination of the issuance of the highbridge note and a warrant exercisable for  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  which expired unexercised in september the original discount associated with the warrant issued in conjunction with the highbridge note original discount amount  was amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the note 
interest only was payable quarterly in arrears during the term of the note and the entire principal balance was due at the maturity date 
the note matured on september   at which time we paid the full principal amount of  plus all accrued interest through additional borrowings under our line of credit with wells fargo 
the amscan note was a subordinated promissory note in the original principal amount of  which was issued when we converted  at our option  certain extended payables into a subordinated promissory note 
the amscan note bore interest at the rate of per annum and was payable in thirty six equal monthly installments of principal and interest of  beginning on november  the remaining principal balance and all accrued interest were paid in full on september  the party city note was a subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of  which was issued in connection with the acquisition of a party city retail party goods store in peabody  massachusetts 
the note bore interest at the rate of per annum and was payable by quarterly interest only payments over four years  with the full principal amount due at the note s maturity on august  we paid the full principal amount of  plus all accrued interest on august  through additional borrowings under our facility with wells fargo 
line of credit on october   we entered into the first amendment amendment to the second amended and restated credit agreement the facility with wells fargo 
the facility continues the previous revolving line of credit in the amount of up to  and extends the maturity date for five years to october  the facility includes an option whereby we may increase the revolving line of credit up to a maximum level of  the amount of credit that is available from time to time under the facility is determined as a percentage of the value of eligible inventory plus a percentage of the value of eligible credit card receivables  as reduced by certain reserve amounts that may be required by wells fargo 
borrowings under the facility will generally accrue interest at a margin of over a base rate determined by wells fargo from time to time  or  at our election  over the london interbank offered rate libor 
the facility provides for letters of credit for up to a sublimit of million to be used in connection with inventory purchases and includes an unused line fee on the unused portion of the facility 
our obligations under the facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our personal property 
the outstanding balances under the facility are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because we are required to apply daily lock box receipts to reduce the amount outstanding 
the facility contains events of default customary for credit facilities of this type 
upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods  in addition to other remedies that may be available to wells fargo  the obligations under the line may be accelerated  outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and the lenders may exercise remedies to collect the balance due  including to foreclose on the collateral 
our inventory consists of party supplies which are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market  which approximates fifo first in  first out and are reduced or increased by adjustments including vendor rebates and discounts and freight costs 
our facility availability calculation allows us to borrow against acceptable inventory at cost  which is based on our inventory at cost and applies adjustments that wells fargo has approved  which may be different than adjustments we use for valuing our inventory in our financial statements  such as the adjustment to reserve for inventory shortage 
the amount of acceptable inventory at cost was approximately  at december  our accounts receivable consist primarily of credit card receivables and vendor rebates receivable 
our facility availability calculation allows us to borrow against eligible credit card receivables  which are the credit card receivables for the previous two to three days of business 
the amount of eligible credit card receivables was approximately  at december  our total borrowing base is determined by adding the acceptable inventory at cost times an agreed upon advance rate plus the eligible credit card receivables times an agreed upon advance rate but not to exceed our established credit limit  which was  at december  under the terms of the facility  our  credit limit was further reduced by a minimum availability block  customer deposits  gift certificates  merchandise credits and outstanding letters of credit 
the amounts outstanding under the facility were  at december  and  at december   an increase of  our additional availability was  at december  and  at december  the facility has financial covenants that are limited to minimum availability and capital expenditures and contains various restrictive covenants  such as incurrence  payment or entry into certain indebtedness  liens  investments  acquisitions  mergers  dispositions and dividends 
under the facility  we are required to maintain a minimum availability of of the credit limit  except for the period january  through april   during which time the minimum availability is zero 
the facility also requires us to limit our capital expenditures to within of those amounts included in our business plan  which may be updated from time to time 
at december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
supply agreement with amscan our supply agreement with amscan gives us the right to receive more favorable pricing terms over the term of the supply agreement than generally were available to us under our previous terms with amscan 
in exchange  the supply agreement obligates us to purchase increased levels of merchandise from amscan 
beginning with calendar year  the supply agreement requires us to purchase on an annual basis merchandise equal to the total number of our stores  excluding temporary stores  open during such calendar year  multiplied by  the supply agreement extends until december  the supply agreement provides for penalties in the event we fail to attain the annual purchase commitment that would require us to pay amscan the difference between the purchases for that year and the annual purchase commitment for that year 
under the terms of the supply agreement  the annual purchase commitment for any individual year can be reduced for orders placed by us but not filled by amscan 
our purchases for fell short of the annual commitment by approximately  which unfilled commitment was rolled into and our purchases for exceeded the minimum purchase amount commitments plus the short fall of  our purchases for also exceeded the minimum purchase amount commitments 
the company is not aware of any reason that would prevent it from meeting the minimum purchase requirements for the remainder of or for although we do not expect to incur any penalties under this supply agreement  if they were to occur  there could be a material adverse effect on our uses and sources of cash 
operating  investing and financing activities our operating activities used  in compared to providing  in  a decrease of  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in net income in we used  in investing activities in compared to  in  a decrease of  the cash invested in was primarily for fixtures and equipment for our new manchester  ct store  network infrastructure and point of sale register upgrades as well as existing store improvements 
the cash invested in was primarily due to the new store opening in boston  ma  the opening of eleven temporary halloween stores  point of sale register updates in our retail stores and other store improvements 
financing activities provided  in financing activities in compared to  during  an increase of  the increase was primarily due to increased net borrowings on the line of credit during compared to contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period within within within after year years years years total line of credit capital lease obligations supply agreement operating leases including retail space leases total contractual obligations the outstanding balances under the facility  or line of credit  are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since we are required to apply daily lock box receipts to reduce the amount outstanding 
in addition  at december   we had outstanding purchase orders totaling approximately  for the acquisition of inventory and non inventory items that were scheduled for delivery after december  acquisitions we operate in a largely un branded market that has many small businesses 
as a result  we have considered  and may continue to consider  growing our business through acquisitions of other entities 
our growth strategy for and beyond includes expanding and targeting the temporary halloween store aspect of our business  opening new stores  relocating or consolidating existing stores  reviewing potential acquisition of other entities  and developing our e commerce site 
any determination whether to open a new or temporary store or make an acquisition is based upon a variety of factors  including  without limitation  the purchase price and other financial terms of the transaction  our liquidity and ability to finance the transaction  the business prospects  geographical location and the extent to which any new or temporary store or acquisition would enhance our business 
in  we acquired a store location in manchester  ct from a competitor 
in january  we closed our older store in the manchester  ct market
