item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview general 
progenics pharmaceuticals is dedicated to the development of innovative medicines to treat disease 
our focus is on the treatment of cancer 
our first commercial drug is relistor  for the treatment of opioid induced constipation oic in patients with advanced illnesses  such as cancer 
oic is the constipation that often arises when patients take opioids for pain relief 
relistor is the only prescription medicine approved in the united states to treat this form of constipation 
relistor subcutaneous injection is now approved in the us and over other counties around the world 
in the us relistor is marketed by our commercial partner salix pharmaceuticals  a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on gastrointestinal diseases  it is sold outside the us by sublicensees of salix 
our partner ono pharmaceutical is currently developing subcutaneous relistor for japan 
our current principal sources of revenue from operations are upfront  commercialization milestone  royalty and revenue sharing payments from salix s relistor operations 
together with salix we have applied to the us food and drug administration to expand the population that can be treated with subcutaneous relistor to include patients taking opioids for non cancer pain  and who suffer from oic as a result 
this population includes patients taking opioids for conditions such as back pain or joint pain 
the fda s action date on this marketing application under the prescription drug user fee act pdufa is april  we also recently announced results from a phase clinical test of an oral form of relistor  in which the efficacy of oral methylnaltrexone was comparable to that reported in clinical studies of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone in subjects with chronic  non cancer pain  and the overall observed safety profile in patients treated was comparable to placebo 
our lead oncology product candidate is psma adc  a fully human monoclonal antibody drug conjugate adc directed against prostate specific membrane antigen psma  a protein found at high levels on the surface of prostate cancer cells and also on the neovasculature of a number of other types of solid tumors 
we are conducting a phase clinical trial of psma adc for the treatment of prostate cancer which we expect will be completed in  and if the results are successful we plan then to commence a phase trial of psma adc in advanced prostate cancer 
as a part of our work in oncology  we are also conducting preclinical development of novel multiplex phosphoinositide kinase pik inhibitors 
we believe these compounds may be effective in blocking signaling pathways that are critical in the growth of aggressive cancers  particularly ras mutated tumors 
with our focus on the development of medicines to treat cancer  we are seeking opportunities to expand our oncology pipeline through in licensing and acquisitions 
we have discontinued work on programs outside of this focus and are working to out license them 
our sources of revenues for the year ended december  have been payments under our collaboration agreements  including million from upfront payments and collaboration reimbursements and million from royalties  and million from research grants from nih related to our oncology and virology programs 
salix  progenics and former collaborator wyeth have transitioned us  european and other marketing authorizations and are transitioning additional commercialization outside of the us and japan 
salix has secured distribution and marketing partners for relistor in europe and has granted a license to link medical products pty limited for distribution in australia  new zealand  south africa and certain other markets in asia 
royalty income in is based only on net sales reported by salix  royalty income through september  was based on net sales reported by wyeth 
salix is continuing its efforts to secure additional distribution partners and or sublicensees 
to date  our product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents and we expect that those sales will not significantly increase over current levels in the near future 
a majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities 
during  expenses for our relistor research program were million compared to million in and million in expenses for our cancer and hiv research programs were million and million  respectively  during compared to i million and million  respectively in and ii million and million  respectively  in our expenses and reimbursement revenue related to relistor in the future will depend on the amount of research and development work we perform upon requests by salix or ono 
we also expect to incur a significant amount of development expenses for our oncology programs as these programs progress 
we expect future expenses related to research and development for which we receive reimbursement from the nih  including the hiv program  to decline to the extent we out license these programs 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from million at december  we expect that this amount will be sufficient to fund operations as currently anticipated beyond one year 
we may require additional funding in the future  and if we are unable to conclude favorable collaboration  license  asset sale  capital raising or other financing transactions  we will have to reduce  delay or eliminate spending on some current operations  and or reduce salary and other overhead expenses  to extend our remaining operations 
we expect funding from the nih to decline in the future to the extent we out license existing nih funded programs not in the oncology area 
we expect to incur operating losses during the near term 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and auction rate securities increased million to million from million at december  
table of contents relistor 
relistor has been approved by regulatory authorities in the us  countries in the european union  canada and australia since for treatment of oic in advanced illness patients receiving palliative care when laxative therapy has not been sufficient 
marketing applications are pending elsewhere throughout the world 
under our license agreement  salix is responsible for further developing and commercializing subcutaneous relistor  including completing clinical development necessary to support regulatory marketing approvals for potential new indications and formulations of the drug 
through december   we have received under this agreement a million upfront cash payment and million in respect of salix ex us sublicensee revenue and are eligible to receive i up to million upon us marketing approval for subcutaneous relistor in non cancer pain patients  ii up to million upon us marketing approval of an oral formulation of relistor  iii up to million of commercialization milestone payments upon achievement of specified us sales targets  iv royalties ranging from to percent of net sales by salix and its affiliates  and v of any upfront  milestone  reimbursement or other revenue net of costs of goods sold  as defined  and territory specific research and development expense reimbursement salix receives from sublicensees outside the us in the event that either marketing approval is subject to a black box warning or risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems  payment of a portion of the milestone amount would be deferred  and subject  to achievement of the first commercialization milestone 
relistor was previously developed and commercialized worldwide except japan with wyeth pursuant to a collaboration agreement that was terminated in october salix  progenics  and progenics former collaborator wyeth have transitioned us  european and other marketing authorizations and are transitioning additional commercialization outside the us and japan 
salix has secured distribution and marketing partners for relistor in the european territory and has licensed link medical products pty limited for distribution in australia  new zealand  south africa and certain other markets in asia 
salix is continuing efforts to secure additional distribution partners and or sublicensees 
royalty income in is based on net sales reported by salix  royalty income through september  was based on net sales reported by wyeth 
under the transition agreement  wyeth paid us million in six quarterly installments through january wyeth also provided financial resources for the development of a multi dose pen for subcutaneous relistor for which we recognized million in and million in together with salix we have applied to the us food and drug administration to expand the population that can be treated with subcutaneous relistor to include patients taking opioids for non cancer pain  and who suffer from oic as a result 
this population includes patients taking opioids for conditions such as back pain or joint pain 
we have also received us  us and canadian approvals to market relistor in pre filled syringes  which are designed to ease preparation and administration for patients and caregivers  and expect salix to introduce that product in in return for our october out license to ono pharmaceutical of the rights to subcutaneous relistor in japan  we received an upfront payment of million and the right to receive potential milestones  upon achievement of development responsibilities by ono  of up to million  commercial milestones and royalties on sales by ono of subcutaneous relistor in japan 
ono also has the option to acquire from us the rights to develop and commercialize in japan other formulations of relistor on terms to be negotiated separately 
ono may request us to perform activities related to its development and commercialization responsibilities beyond our participation in joint committees and specified technology transfer related tasks which will be at its expense  and reimbursable at the time we perform these services 
royalty and milestone payments will depend on success in development and commercialization of relistor  which is dependent on many factors  such as the actions of salix and ono and any other business partner s with which we may collaborate  decisions by the fda and other regulatory bodies  the outcome of clinical and other testing of relistor  and our own efforts 
many of these matters are outside our control 
in particular  we cannot guarantee that salix will be successful in furthering the development and commercialization of the relistor franchise 
oncology 
we recently announced preliminary data from a phase clinical trial of a fully human monoclonal adc directed against psma for the treatment of prostate cancer and recently presented data from preclinical studies of novel multiplex phosphoinositide kinase pik inhibitors for the treatment of cancer

our expenses and reimbursement revenue related to relistor have declined substantially in the second half of  since salix assumed direct responsibility for expenses under third party contracts we have assigned to it 
under the salix license agreement  we are reimbursed for salix approved full time equivalents fte and third party development expenses incurred and paid by us after february  for the year ended december   we incurred  of relistor related expenses for which we have received reimbursements from salix and wyeth totaling  and  respectively  through december   and in respect of which we expect to receive during the first quarter of at december   we held  in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of  from  at december  we expect that this amount will be sufficient to fund operations as currently anticipated beyond one year

our cash flow from operating activities was positive for the year ended december   due to the receipt in of a  salix upfront payment  in respect of salix ex us sublicensee revenue and  in reimbursement payments from salix and wyeth  partially offset by expenditures on our research and development programs and general and administrative costs 
our cash flow from operating activities was negative for the years ended december  and due primarily to the excess of expenditures on our research and development programs and general and administrative costs over cash received from collaborators and government grants to fund such programs  as described below 
see risk factors 
during the third quarter of  we put in place a shelf registration statement with the sec which may be used for the issuance of up to million of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  other rights and units 
we do not have any current plans for issuing securities under this registration statement  which may be used up to three years from its effective date

under our license agreement with ono  we are entitled to receive potential milestone payments  upon achievement of development milestones by ono  of up to  commercial milestones and royalties on sales of subcutaneous relistor in japan 
ono is also responsible for development and commercialization costs for subcutaneous relistor in japan 
we have partially funded research programs through awards from the nih 
for the years ended december   and  we received   and  respectively  of revenue from all of our nih awards including the received as part of the federal government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project 
we expect funding from the nih to decline in the future to the extent we out license existing nih funded programs not in the oncology area 

table of contents changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable for the years ended december   and resulted from the timing of receipts from the nih  salix  wyeth and ono  and payments made to trade vendors in the normal course of business 
other than amounts to be received from salix and ono  we have no committed external sources of capital 
other than revenues from relistor  we expect no significant product revenues for a number of years  as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our product candidates to the commercial marketing stage 
investing activities 
we redeem money market funds and use proceeds from maturities to provide funding for operations 
of  in cash and cash equivalents   are guaranteed by the us treasury or federal deposit insurance corporation s guarantee program 
our auction rate securities of  include  of securities collateralized by student loan obligations subsidized by the us government 
these investments  while rated investment grade by the standard poor s and moody s rating agencies and predominantly having scheduled maturities greater than ten years  are heavily concentrated in the us financial sector 
we have received all scheduled interest payments on the auction rate securities we hold at december  we will not realize cash in respect of the principal amount of these securities until the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid  or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we monitor markets for our investments  but cannot guarantee that additional losses will not be required to be recorded 
valuation of securities is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity and general economic and market conditions 
we do not believe the carrying values of our investments are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 
our money market funds are purchased and  in the case of auction rate securities  sold by third party brokers in accordance with our investment policy guidelines 
our brokerage account requires that all securities be held to maturity unless authorization is obtained from us to sell earlier 
in fact  we had a history of holding all securities to maturity prior to the second quarter of  when we decided to sell a portion of our securities which had scheduled maturities between the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of the proceeds from these sales were million  resulting in a gain of million 
we expect to recover the amortized cost of all of our investments at maturity 
because we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business and believe it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of principal  we do not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  financing activities 
during the years ended december   and  we received cash of   and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options and from the sale of our common stock under our purchase plans 
the amount of cash we receive from these sources fluctuates commensurate with headcount levels and changes in the price of our common stock on the grant date for options exercised  and on the sale date for shares sold under the purchase plans 
unless we obtain regulatory approval from the fda for additional product candidates and or enter into agreements with corporate collaborators with respect to our additional technologies  we will be required to fund our operations in the future through sales of common stock or other securities  royalty or other financing agreements and or grants and government contracts 
adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us may seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 
uses of cash operating activities 
the majority of our cash has been used to advance our research and development programs 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
for various reasons  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials  our dependence in certain instances on third parties  many of which are outside of our control  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete all our research and development programs 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred  by project  were as follows relistor cancer hiv other programs total we may require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  file and prosecute patent applications and enforce or defend patent claims  if any  and fund product in licensing and any possible acquisitions 
investing activities 
during the years ended december   and  we have spent   and  respectively  on capital expenditures 
these expenditures have been primarily related to leasehold improvements and the purchase of laboratory equipment for our research and development projects 
contractual obligations our funding requirements  both for the next months and beyond  will include required payments under operating leases and fixed and contingent payments under our licensing and collaboration agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future payments under these agreements payments due by year end total thereafter in millions operating leases license and collaboration agreements fixed payments contingent payments total based on assumed achievement of milestones covered under each agreement  the timing and payment of which is highly uncertain 
we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of each of our programs to determine if continued research and development is commercially and economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development in these programs  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete research and development projects in a timely manner or failure to enter into collaborative agreements could significantly increase capital requirements and adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships or new relationships with licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be deviations from that plan that would consume our assets earlier than planned 
off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees we have no obligations under off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other unconsolidated entity 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not otherwise readily apparent 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome and  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified our critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from all sources based on the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab and asc revenue recognition 
in october  the fasb updated asc revenue recognition by specifying how to separate deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements  and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
under asc  the delivered item s are separate units of accounting  provided i the delivered item s have value to a collaborator on a stand alone basis  and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we adopted this update on january  royalty revenue is recognized based upon net sales of related licensed products 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period the sales occur  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement providing for the royalty 
amounts not expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as long term deferred revenue 
the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as short term or long term is based upon the periods in which we expect to perform joint committee services 
share based payment arrangements 
our share based compensation to employees includes non qualified stock options  restricted stock and shares issued under our purchase plans  which are compensatory under asc compensation stock compensation 
we account for share based compensation to non employees  including non qualified stock options and restricted stock  in accordance with asc equity 
the fair value of each non qualified stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model requires input assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock  which is based upon the daily quoted market prices on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term  ii the period of time over which employees  officers  directors and non employee consultants are expected to hold their options prior to exercise  iii zero expected dividend yield due to never having paid dividends and not expecting to pay dividends in the future  and iv risk free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the options  which are based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
historical volatilities are based upon daily quoted market prices of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term of the related equity instruments 
we rely only on historical volatility since it provides the most reliable indication of future volatility 
future volatility is expected to be consistent with historical  historical volatility is calculated using a simple average calculation  historical data is available for the length of the option s expected term and a sufficient number of price observations are used consistently 
since our stock options are not traded on a public market  we do not use implied volatility 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based upon historical data related to exercise and post termination cancellation activity 
the expected term of stock options granted to our chief executive officer ceo  chief science officer cso and non employee directors and consultants are calculated separately from stock options granted to employees and other officers 

table of contents we apply a forfeiture rate to the number of unvested awards in each reporting period in order to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimated forfeiture rates are based upon historical data on vesting behavior of employees 
we adjust the total amount of compensation cost recognized for each award  in the period in which each award vests  to reflect the actual forfeitures related to that award 
changes in our estimated forfeiture rate will result in changes in the rate at which compensation cost for an award is recognized over its vesting period 
changes in the assumptions used to compute the fair value of the option awards are likely to affect the fair value of the non qualified stock option awards and the amount of compensation expense recognized in future periods 
a higher volatility  longer expected term and higher risk free rate increases the resulting compensation expense recognized in future periods as compared to prior periods 
conversely  a lower volatility  shorter expected term and lower risk free rate decreases the resulting compensation expense recognized in future periods as compared to prior periods 
for performance based stock option awards vesting of a defined portion of each award will occur earlier if a defined performance condition is achieved  more than one condition may be achieved in any period 
we estimate the probability of achievement of each performance condition and use those probabilities to determine the requisite service period of each award 
the requisite service period for the award is the shortest of the explicit or implied service periods 
in the case of the cso s options  the explicit service period is nine years and months from the respective grant dates 
the implied service periods related to the performance conditions are the estimated times for each performance condition to be achieved 
thus  compensation expense will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of performance conditions for that award assuming that the performance conditions will be achieved before the cliff vesting occurs 
for performance and market based stock option awards to our ceo consisting of options in and cso consisting of options in and and options and restricted stock in  vesting occurs on the basis of the achievement of specified performance or market based milestones 
the options have an exercise price equal to the closing price on our common stock on the date of grant 
the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation model and the expense related to these grants will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of the performance or market conditions 
on july   we granted an option to our ceo which vests on the basis of the achievement of specified performance based milestones 
the option has an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the award is valued using the black scholes option pricing model and the expense related to this grant will be recognized during the period in which one of the performance milestones is achieved 
the awards will not vest unless one of the performance milestones is achieved or the market condition is met 
changes in the estimate of probability of achievement of any performance or market condition will be reflected in compensation expense of the period of change and future periods affected by the change 
research and development expenses including clinical trial expenses 
clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed as incurred  and are based on the total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
in addition to clinical trial expenses  we estimate the amounts of other research and development expenses  for which invoices have not been received at the end of a period  based upon communication with third parties that have provided services or goods during the period 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
fair value measurements 
our available for sale investment portfolio consists of money market funds and auction rate securities  and is recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities 
the change in the fair value of these investments is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
we continue to monitor markets for our investments and consider the impact  if any  of market conditions on the fair market value of our investments 
we expect to recover the amortized cost of all of our investments at maturity 
currently  we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business and we believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of principal 
we do not believe the carrying values of our investments are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 
valuation of securities is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity and general economic and market conditions 
the valuation of the auction rate securities we hold is based on an internal analysis of timing of expected future successful auctions  collateralization of underlying assets of the security and credit quality of the security 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 which requires that comprehensive income and the related components be presented in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   except for the deferral of the effective date related to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income under asu no 
 which was issued in january we are currently evaluating the effect this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 which is the result of joint efforts by the fasb and international accounting standards board to develop a single  converged fair value framework 
the converged guidance specifies how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements 
the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal 
our available for sale investments consist of money market funds and auction rate securities  all of which had interest rates that were variable and totaled  at december  as a result  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   we continue to hold approximately  of assets measured at fair value of auction rate securities  in respect of which we have received all scheduled interest payments 
the principal amount of these remaining auction rate securities will not be accessible until the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider the impact  if any  of market conditions on the fair market value of our investments 
we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of these securities  although valuation of them is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity  and general economic and market conditions 
we do not believe the carrying values of these auction rate securities are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 
the valuation of the auction rate securities we hold is based on an internal analysis of timing of expected future successful auctions  collateralization of underlying assets of the security and credit quality of the security 
we re evaluated the valuation of these securities as of december  and the temporary impairment amount decreased from at december  to a basis point increase to our internal analysis would result in a increase in the temporary impairment of these securities as of the year ended december
