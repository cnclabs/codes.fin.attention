item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture and sell versatile and high performance video infrastructure products and system solutions 
we enable our customers to efficiently create  prepare and deliver a full range of video services to consumer devices  including televisions  personal computers  tablets and mobile phones 
our products generally fall into three principal categories video production platforms and playout solutions  video processing solutions and edge and access solutions 
we also provide technical support services and professional services to our customers worldwide 
the principal markets we serve are cable television  direct broadcast satellite system companies  telecommunications companies  or telcos  broadcasters and media companies  as well as  more recently  the emerging streaming media providers  that create video programming or offer video based infrastructure 
historically  a majority of our revenue has been derived from relatively few customers  due in part to the consolidation of the ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite system companies 
sales to our ten largest customers in  and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue 
revenue from our ten largest customers has decreased as a percentage of revenue  due to our growing customer base  in part  as a result of acquisitions we have made 
although we are attempting to broaden our customer base by penetrating new markets and further expanding internationally  we expect to see continuing industry consolidation and customer concentration 
during  and  revenue from comcast accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenue 
the loss of comcast or any other significant customer  any material reduction in orders by comcast or any significant customer  or our failure to qualify our new products with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents we recognized revenue of million in  as compared to million in our international revenue represents a growing part of our business 
growth in international sales from to was  while growth in domestic sales was during the same time period 
in  international sales represented of our total revenue 
in recognition of our growing international business opportunities  we have expanded our international operations and staffing to better support our expansion into international markets 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future  and expect that  due to sales to emerging markets in particular  our international revenue may increase as a percentage of our total net revenue from year to year 
historically  our revenue has been dependent upon capital spending in the cable  satellite  telco and broadcast industries 
more recently  we also have derived revenue from media companies  including streaming media providers 
industry consolidation has in the past constrained  and may in the future constrain  capital spending by our customers 
if our product portfolio and product development plans do not position us well to capture an increased portion of the capital spending of customers in the markets on which we focus  our revenue may decline 
as we attempt to further diversify our customer base in these markets  we may need to continue to build alliances with other equipment manufacturers and content providers  adapt our products for new applications  take orders at prices resulting in lower margins  and build internal expertise to handle the particular contractual and technical demands of the media market  which could result in higher operating costs 
implementation issues with our products or those of other vendors have caused  and may continue to cause  delays in project completion for our customers and delay our recognition of revenue 
financial difficulties of certain of our customers and changes in our customers deployment plans have adversely affected our business in the past 
in  economic conditions in many of the countries in which we sell products were very weak  and global economic conditions and financial markets experienced a severe downturn 
the downturn stemmed from a multitude of factors  including adverse credit conditions  slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  rapid changes in foreign exchange rates  increased energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns 
in the second half of and in  we saw capital spending return to the levels we experienced before however  economic growth may be sluggish in certain geographies in  particularly in the us and europe 
if an economic downturn were to occur in the future  customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures  which in turn often results in lower demand for our products 
as part of our business strategy  from time to time we have acquired  and continue to consider acquiring  businesses  technologies  assets and product lines that we believe complement or expand our existing business 
in march  we completed the acquisition of scopus video networks  ltd scopus 
the acquisition of scopus provided complementary video processing technology  expanded research and development capability and additional sales and distribution channels  particularly in emerging markets 
in september  we completed the acquisition of omneon  inc  a company specializing in file based infrastructure for the production  preparation and playout of video content typically deployed by broadcasters  satellite operators  content owners and other media companies 
omneon s business is complementary to harmonic s core business  and expands our customer reach into content providers and extends our product lines into video servers and video optimized storage for content production and playout 
in connection with these acquisitions  our operating results for and included acquisition costs  restructuring expenses and  in the case of scopus  charges to cost of revenue for excess and obsolete inventories from product discontinuances 
further  the financial results of scopus and omneon  including the amortization of acquired intangible assets  have been included in our results of operations as of their acquisition date  and have had a significant impact on our revenues  cost of revenues  and operating expenses since the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures requires harmonic to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying 
table of contents notes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of harmonic s accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that we believe have the most significant impact on harmonic s financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation  accounting for income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition harmonic s principal sources of revenue are from the sale of hardware  software  hardware and software maintenance contracts  and the sale of end to end solutions  encompassing design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of products 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
because of the concentrated nature of our customer base  different judgments or estimates made for any one large contract or customer could result in material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any particular period 
we have multiple element revenue arrangements that include hardware and software essential to the hardware product s functionality 
for transactions originating or materially modified beginning january   we apply new accounting guidance on a prospective basis  which requires that we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
we determine the relative selling prices by first considering vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence tpe of the selling price is used 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings 
the company s process for determining besp involves management s judgment 
the company s process considers multiple factors that may vary over time  depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors  the company s besp may also change 
sales of stand alone software that are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware continue to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
further  the company also applied the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance to its multiple element arrangements for transactions originating prior to january  in accordance with the software revenue recognition guidance  the company 
table of contents applies the residual method to recognize revenue for the delivered elements in stand alone software transactions 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration  less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements  typically maintenance  provided that vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements 
we establish fair value by reference to the price the customer is required to pay when an item is sold separately  using contractually stated  substantive renewal rates  when applicable  or the price of recently completed stand alone sales transactions 
accordingly  the determination as to whether appropriate objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists can impact the timing of revenue recognition for an arrangement 
solution sales for the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of products are accounted for in accordance with applicable guidance on accounting for performance of construction production contracts  using the percentage of completion method of accounting when various other requirements for the use of this accounting guidance exist 
under the percentage of completion method  our revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of actual labor hours expended to total estimated labor hours to complete the project 
costs are recognized proportionally to the labor hours incurred 
management believes that  for each such project  labor hours expended in proportion to total estimated hours at completion represents the most reliable and meaningful measure for determining a project s progress toward completion 
this requires us to estimate  at the outset of each arrangement  a detailed project plan and associated labor hour estimates for each project 
for contracts that include customized services for which labor costs are not reasonably estimable  the company uses the completed contract method of accounting 
under the completed contract method  of the contract s revenue and cost is recognized upon the completion of all services under the contract 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor hours to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results  financial position or cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected 
revenue on shipments to distributors  resellers and systems integrators is generally recognized on delivery 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
distributors and systems integrators purchase our products for specific capital equipment projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration  and post sales service and support 
our agreements with these distributors and systems integrators have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our equipment to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
we have long term relationships with most of these distributors and systems integrators and substantial experience with similar sales of similar products 
we do have instances of accepting product returns from distributors and system integrators 
however  such returns typically occur in instances where the system integrator has designed a product into a project for the end user  but the integrator requests permission to return the component as it does not meet the specific project s functional requirements 
such returns are made solely at the discretion of the company  as our agreements with distributors and system integrators do not provide for return rights 
we have extensive experience monitoring product returns from our distributors  and accordingly  we have concluded that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost  using the weighted average method  or market 
we write down the cost of excess or obsolete inventory to net realizable value based on future demand forecasts and historical consumption 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer 
table of contents requirements  we could be required to record additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory management is of critical importance in order to balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded excess and obsolete inventory charges of million  million and million  respectively 
impairment of goodwill or long lived assets we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill on the basis of market capitalization adjusted for a control premium and  if necessary  discounted cash flows on the company level  which is the sole reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
for example  changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles  goodwill or long lived assets 
we did not record any impairment charges related to our goodwill or long lived assets during the years ended december   or however  there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
at december   our carrying values for goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  leading companies in the telco industry have extensive patent portfolios 
from time to time  third parties have asserted  and may assert in the future  patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights against us or our customers 
we record accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in october  avid technology  inc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware  alleging that harmonic s omneon media grid product infringes two patents held by avid 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages 
an unfavorable outcome of this matter could adversely affect the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
as of december   and the date these financial statements were issued  we do not currently believe a loss is probable and have therefore not recorded a provision for this claim 
in april  arris corporation filed a complaint in the united states district court in atlanta  alleging that our streamliner product infringes four patents held by arris 
the complaint sought injunctive relief and damages 
in connection with this matter  we recorded a million liability in the fourth quarter of  based on a tentative agreement of arris and harmonic with respect to settlement of the action 
in april  this matter was settled on essentially the same terms as the tentative agreement and the action was dismissed 
in march  interkey elc ltd  or interkey  filed a lawsuit in israel  alleging breach of contract against harmonic and scopus video networks ltd 
now harmonic video networks ltd 
or hvn  which was acquired by harmonic in march the plaintiffs are seeking damages in the amount of  ils approximately million 
although  as is the case with all litigation  no assurances can be given as to the outcome of the interkey lawsuit  we believe interkey s and its shareholders claims are without merit and harmonic and hvn intend to vigorously defend themselves against these claims 
based on the foregoing  as of december  and as of the date these financial statements were issued  we do not currently believe a loss is probable and have therefore not recorded a provision for this claim 

table of contents we regularly review all pending litigation in order to assess both the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and whether an estimate of loss can be reasonably estimated 
as a litigation matter progresses  and more information becomes known  our assessment of the potential outcome of such matter may change and we may be required to accrue for a settlement of  or an unfavorable outcome on  such matter  including any of the above referenced or other litigation matters  which could have a material adverse effect on harmonic s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities on a periodic basis 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we apply the provisions of the applicable accounting guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
if the recognition threshold is met  the applicable accounting guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 
we have been notified by the internal revenue service that our and us corporate income tax returns have been selected for audit  which commenced in the second quarter of in addition  the statue of limitations on our us corporate income tax return has been extended 
if upon the conclusion of these audits  the ultimate determination of taxes owed in the us is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded in the applicable period  our overall tax expense  effective tax rate and cash flows could be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
any changes in estimate  or settlement of any particular position  could have a material impact on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
stock based compensation harmonic measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and share purchase rights related to our employee stock purchase plan espp  based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of our stock options and share purchase rights is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 

table of contents the determination of fair value of stock options and share purchase rights on the date of grant  using an option pricing model  is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the stock based compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our stock based compensation awards granted in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period

we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future  and expect that our international revenue may increase as a percentage of our total net revenue from year to year 
net revenue in the us increased in  compared to  primarily due to stronger demand for our products from our domestic cable operators for video on demand and hdtv deployments 
international net revenue in increased  compared to our international net revenue growth was particularly strong in europe  but also reflected the results of the increased share of international video broadcast business in emerging markets that the company had targeted as part of its acquisition of scopus

table of contents gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained relatively flat in  compared to the increase in gross margin was principally due to the increase in sales of production and playout products  which typically carry a higher gross margin than our average gross margin  offset in part by higher amortization of intangibles 
we expect gross margin to increase modestly in the future as sales of our higher gross margin products are generally growing more quickly 
in  of amortization of intangibles was included in cost of sales  compared to million in the higher amortization of intangible expense in was due to the amortization of intangibles arising from the omneon acquisition  which was completed in september we expect to record approximately million in amortization of intangibles expense in cost of sales in  primarily resulting from the acquisitions of omneon and scopus 
the increase in gross profit in  compared to  was primarily due to increased net revenue 
the gross profit percentage of in  compared to in  was higher primarily due to a more favorable mix of net revenue towards higher gross margin products  such as video processing products and production and playout products 
also during  our provision for excess and obsolete inventories declined from levels 
in  we had recorded inventory provisions totaling million  after the acquisition of scopus  related to the discontinuance of certain scopus product lines

we expect research and development expense to increase modestly in absolute dollars  and remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue  as we continue to invest in new product areas 
the increased compensation expense  outside engineering services and stock based compensation expense were primarily due to increased engineering headcount and activities resulting from the omneon acquisition  as well as additional hiring of employees engaged in engineering activities 
the increased facilities related expenses were primarily due to additional depreciation of building improvements and lab equipment costs incurred in order to consolidate the omneon employees within our san jose headquarters building

these increases were partially offset by the absence of million of acquisition related costs incurred in in connection with the acquisition of omneon and a decrease of million of excess facilities charges primarily related to the closure of the omneon sunnyvale office in the increased compensation expense  stock based compensation expense and travel expense in were primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the omneon acquisition and higher commission expense resulting from increased net revenue in the increase in consulting and professional service expense was related to higher temporary headcount and additional consulting resources being used in general and administrative activities 
we expect selling  general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars  principally due to investments in international markets  but decrease as a percentage of revenue

the increase in accrued and other liabilities was mostly attributable to higher incentive compensation accruals in  as compared to  as a result of the increase in revenue in we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  shipment linearity  accounts receivable collections performance  inventory and supply chain management  tax benefits from stock based compensation  and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments 
we usually pay our annual incentive compensation to employees in the first quarter

as of december   a substantial majority of the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were held in accounts in the united states 
the company believes that these funds are sufficient to meet the requirements of our us operations for the next twelve months 
in the event we need or desire to access funds from the short term investments that we hold  it is possible that we may not be able to do so due to adverse market conditions 
our inability to sell all or some of our short term investments at par or our cost  or rating downgrades of issuers of these securities  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
nevertheless  we believe that our existing liquidity sources will satisfy our presently contemplated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if our expectations are incorrect  we may need to raise additional funds to fund our operations  to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 

table of contents in addition  we actively review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including any global or european economic slowdown  market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  and conditions in financial markets and the industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

the scope of these indemnities varies  but  in some instances  includes indemnification for defense costs  damages and other expenses including reasonable attorneys fees 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries  and changes in the value of financial instruments held by harmonic 
foreign currency exchange risk harmonic has a number of international subsidiaries  each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
in addition  harmonic has various international branch offices that provide sales support and systems integration services 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately and of net revenue in and  respectively 
periodically  harmonic enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to foreign accounts receivable and reduce the effects of fluctuating exchange rates on expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
harmonic does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   the company had a forward exchange contract to sell israeli shekels ils with a notional value of million  euros with a notional value of million and british pounds with a notional value of million 
these foreign exchange contracts mature in the first quarter of at december   we had a forward exchange contract to sell euros totaling million and a forward exchange contract to sell japanese yen totaling million 
these forward exchange contracts matured in the first quarter of while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
interest rate and credit risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as of december   gross unrealized gains were nominal 
if the credit market deteriorates  we may incur realized losses  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if harmonic were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance was million 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  declining interest rates would negatively impact investment income 
based on our estimates  a change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investments by approximately million as of december
