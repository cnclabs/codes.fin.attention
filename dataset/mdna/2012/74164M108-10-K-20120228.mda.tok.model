item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of primerica  inc the parent company and its subsidiaries collectively  we or the company for the three year period ended december  as a result  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes that are included herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that constitute our plans  estimates and beliefs 
these forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors 
actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
this md a is divided into the following sections the transactions business trends and conditions factors affecting our results critical accounting estimates results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital resources the transactions we refer to the corporate reorganization  the reinsurance transactions  the concurrent transactions and the private sale described below collectively as the transactions 
the corporate reorganization 
the parent company was incorporated in delaware in october by citi to serve as a holding company for the life insurance and financial product distribution businesses that we have operated for more than years 
at such time  we issued shares of common stock to citi 
these businesses  which prior to april   were wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of citi  were transferred to us in a reorganization pursuant to which we issued to a wholly owned subsidiary of citi i  shares of our common stock of which  shares of common stock were subsequently sold by citi in our ipo   shares of common stock were subsequently sold by citi in mid april to warburg pincus for a purchase price of million the private sale  and  shares of common stock were immediately contributed back to us for equity awards granted to our employees and sales force leaders in 
table of contents connection with our ipo  ii warrants to purchase from us an aggregate of  shares of our common stock which were transferred by citi to warburg pincus pursuant to the private sale  and iii the citi note 
prior to april   we had no material assets or liabilities 
upon completion of the transactions  the parent company s primary asset was and continues to be the capital stock of its operating subsidiaries and its primary liability was and continues to be the citi note 
the reinsurance transactions 
in march  we entered into coinsurance agreements the citi reinsurance agreements with two affiliates of citi and prime re  then a wholly owned subsidiary of primerica life collectively  the citi reinsurers 
we refer to the execution of these agreements as the citi reinsurance transactions 
under these agreements  we ceded between and of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year end we also transferred to the citi reinsurers the account balances in respect of the coinsured policies and approximately billion of assets to support the statutory liabilities assumed by the citi reinsurers  and we distributed to citi all of the issued and outstanding common stock of prime re 
as a result  the citi reinsurance transactions reduced the amount of our capital and substantially reduced our insurance exposure 
we retained our operating platform and infrastructure and continue to administer all policies subject to these coinsurance agreements 
the concurrent transactions 
during the first quarter of  we declared distributions to citi of approximately million 
we also recognized the income attributable to the policies underlying the citi reinsurance transactions as well as the income earned on the invested assets backing the reinsurance balances and the extraordinary dividends declared in the first quarter 
these items were reflected in the statement of income for the three months ended march  furthermore  because the citi reinsurance transactions were given retroactive effect back to january   we recognized a return of capital on our balance sheet for the income earned on the reinsured policies during the three months ended march  in april  we completed the following additional concurrent transactions we completed the ipo pursuant to the securities act of  as amended  and our stock began trading under the ticker symbol pri on the nyse  we issued equity awards for  shares of our common stock to certain of our employees  including our officers  and certain of our sales force leaders  including  shares which were issued upon conversion of existing equity awards in citi shares that had not yet fully vested  and citi accelerated vesting of certain existing citi equity awards triggered by the ipo and the private sale 
additionally  we made elections with an effective date of april  under section h of the internal revenue code the section h elections  which resulted in reductions to stockholders equity of million and corresponding adjustments to deferred tax balances 
during the first quarter of  our federal income tax return was included as part of citi s consolidated federal income tax return 
on march   in anticipation of our corporate reorganization  we entered into a tax separation agreement with citi 
in accordance with the tax separation agreement  citi is responsible for  and shall indemnify and hold the company harmless from and against  any consolidated  combined  affiliated  unitary or similar federal  state or local income tax liability with respect to the company for any taxable period ending on or before april   the closing date of the ipo 
the private sale 
in february  citi entered into a securities purchase agreement with warburg pincus and us pursuant to which  in mid april  citi sold to warburg pincus  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase from us  additional shares of our common stock 
the warrants have a seven year term and an exercise price of per share 
period over period comparability 
due to the timing of these transactions and their impact on our financial position and results of operations  period over period comparisons will reflect significant non comparable accounting transactions and account balances 
the most significant accounting transaction was the reinsurance transactions described above  which affected both the size and composition of our balance sheet and statement of income 
additionally  the corporate reorganization and the concurrent transactions had a significant impact on the composition of our balance sheet 
as a result  our statements of income for the years ended december  and present income that is significantly lower than in from a statement of income perspective  the transactions impacted ceded premiums  net premiums  net investment income  benefits and claims  amortization of dac  insurance commissions  insurance expenses  interest expense and income taxes 
actual results for periods ended prior to april  will not be indicative of or comparable to future actual results 
furthermore  actual results for the year ended december  will not be comparable to results in future years as they are affected by the inclusion of three months of operations prior to the transactions 

table of contents business trends and conditions the relative strength and stability of financial markets and economies in the united states and canada affect our growth and profitability 
our business is  and we expect will continue to be  influenced by a number of industry wide and product specific trends and conditions 
economic conditions  including high unemployment levels and low levels of consumer confidence  influence investment and spending decisions by middle income consumers  our primary clients 
these conditions and factors also impact prospective recruits perceptions of the business opportunity that becoming a primerica sales representative offers  which can drive or dampen recruiting 
consumer spending and borrowing levels remain under pressure  as consumers take a more conservative financial posture including reevaluating their savings and debt management goals 
as overall market and economic conditions have improved and stabilized from the lows experienced during the recent economic downturn  sales and the value of consumer investment products across a wide spectrum of asset classes have improved 
recruiting and sales representatives 
recruiting increased in to  new recruits from  new recruits in  benefiting from a surge in new recruits following our north american convention held in june at the georgia dome in atlanta 
we believe that the surge resulted from both a promotion that lowered the independent business application iba licensing fee charged to new recruits from to through the end of july and new product and field technology initiatives announced at the convention 
our ability to increase the size of our sales force is largely based on the success of our recruiting efforts and our ability to train and motivate recruits to get licensed 
we believe that recruiting levels are an important advance indicator of sales force trends  and growth in recruiting is usually indicative of future growth in the overall size of the sales force 
however  because new recruits do not always obtain licenses  recruiting results do not always result in commensurate increases in the size of our licensed sales force 
the size of our life licensed sales force declined to  sales representatives as of december  from  sales representatives at december  as new life license growth lagged recruiting growth primarily due to a reduction in the licensing pull through rate and an increase in terminations 
historically  our pull through rate following a recruiting surge has been lower than in other periods 
term life insurance product sales and face amount in force 
we issued  new life insurance policies in  compared with  new policies in sales of our term life insurance products increased in largely as a result of our june introduction of termnow  our new rapid issue term life insurance product for face values of  and below  and increased productivity coming out of our convention 
while our average issued face amount was approximately  in compared with approximately  in  total face amount in force increased to approximately billion as of december  compared with approximately billion a year ago  largely due to persistency that continued to improve relative to prior year and the stronger canadian dollar 
these drivers were partially offset by the decline in the average face amount of our newly issued policies  primarily as a result of termnow sales 
investment and savings product sales and asset values 
investment and savings products sales were higher in  totaling billion  compared with billion in we believe the increase in sales reflects the impact of internal exchanges for variable annuities offering enhanced guarantee terms as well as increasing demand for our products as a result of improving financial market conditions 
the assets in our clients accounts are invested in diversified funds comprised mainly of us and canadian equity and fixed income securities 
the average value of assets in client accounts increased to billion in  from billion in  while the period end asset value declined to billion at december   compared with billion a year ago 
the decrease in period end asset values relative to the increase in average client asset values reflects the magnitude and timing of current and prior year market movements 
invested asset portfolio size and yields 
our portfolio continues to reflect strong market value gains as interest rates and spreads continue to remain low 
as of december   our invested assets  excluding policy loans and cash  had a cost or amortized cost basis of billion and a net unrealized gain of million  compared with billion at cost or amortized cost and net unrealized gain of million at december  factors affecting our results term life insurance segment 
our term life insurance segment results are primarily driven by sales  accuracy of our pricing assumptions  terms and use of reinsurance  investment income and expenses 
sales and policies in force 
sales of new term policies and the size and characteristics of our in force book of policies are vital to our results over the long term 
premium revenue is recognized when due over the term of the policy and 
table of contents acquisition expenses are generally deferred and amortized ratably with the level premiums of the underlying policies 
however  because we incur significant cash outflows at or about the time policies are issued  including the payment of sales commissions and underwriting costs  changes in life insurance sales volume will have a more immediate effect on our cash flows 
historically  we have found that while sales volume of term life insurance products may vary between fiscal periods based on a variety of factors  the productivity of our individual sales representatives remains within a relatively narrow range and  consequently  our sales volume over the longer term generally correlates to the size of our sales force 
the average number of life licensed sales representatives and the number of term life insurance policies issued  as well as the average monthly rate of new policies issued per life licensed sales representative  were as follows year ended december  average number of life licensed sales representatives number of new policies issued average monthly rate of new policies issued per life licensed sales representative x x x our processing cycle provided five additional days of policy processing 
excluding the policies processed during these additional days  the average monthly rate of new policies issued per life licensed sales representative would have been 
x for during  the increased productivity of our individual sales representatives was driven by the post convention recruiting surge discussed earlier and sales of our new termnow product 
the elevated level of new recruits generated more warm market referrals and sales opportunities as new recruits set appointments with their field trainers to begin the sales training process 
further  our new termnow product uses prescription databases to begin the underwriting process in real time at the point of application so termnow policies are issued faster than our prior products which required oral fluid testing 
this underwriting process has led to an increase in  and acceleration of  issued policies since the introduction of termnow in june as a result of these two factors  productivity for was at the high end of our historical range 
pricing assumptions 
our pricing methodology is intended to provide us with appropriate profit margins for the risks we assume 
we determine pricing classifications based on the coverage sought  such as the size and term of the policy  and certain policyholder attributes  such as age and health 
in addition  we utilize unisex rates for our term life insurance policies 
the pricing assumptions that underlie our rates are based upon our best estimates of mortality  persistency and investment yields at the time of issuance  sales force commission rates  issue and underwriting expenses  operating expenses and the characteristics of the insureds  including sex  age  underwriting class  product and amount of coverage 
our results will be affected to the extent there is a variance between our pricing assumptions and actual experience 
persistency 
we use historical experience to estimate pricing assumptions for persistency rates 
persistency is a measure of how long our insurance policies stay in force 
as a general matter  persistency that is lower than our pricing assumptions adversely affects our results over the long term because we lose the recurring revenue stream associated with the policies that lapse 
determining the near term effects of changes in persistency is more complicated 
when persistency is lower than our pricing assumptions  we must accelerate the amortization of dac 
the resultant increase in amortization expense is offset by a corresponding release of reserves associated with lapsed policies  which causes a reduction in benefits and claims expense 
the reserves associated with a given policy will change over the term of such policy 
as a general matter  reserves are lowest at the inception of a policy term and rise steadily to a peak before declining to zero at the expiration of the policy term 
accordingly  depending on when the lapse occurs in relation to the overall policy term  the reduction in benefits and claims expense may be greater or less than the increase in amortization expense and  consequently  the effects on earnings for a given period could be positive or negative 
persistency levels are meaningful to our results to the extent actual experience deviates from the persistency assumptions used to price our products 
mortality 
we use historical experience to estimate pricing assumptions for mortality 
our profitability is affected to the extent actual mortality rates differ from those used in our pricing assumptions 
we mitigate a significant portion of our mortality exposure through reinsurance 
variances between actual mortality experience and the assumptions and estimates used by our reinsurers affect the cost and  potentially  the availability of reinsurance 
investment yields 
we generally use a level investment yield rate which reflects yields currently available 
for and new issues  we are using an increasing interest rate assumption to reflect the historically low interest rate environment 
both the dac asset and the reserve liability increase with the assumed investment yield rate 
since the dac asset is higher than the reserve liability in the early years of a policy  a lower assumed investment yield generally will result in lower profits 
in the later years  when the reserve liability is higher than the dac asset  a lower assumed investment yield generally will result in higher profits 
actual investment yields will 
table of contents impact the net investment income allocated to the term life insurance segment  but will not impact the dac asset or reserve liability 
reinsurance 
we use reinsurance extensively  which has a significant effect on our results of operations 
since the mid s  we have reinsured between and of the mortality risk on our us term life insurance policies on a quota share yrt basis 
we have not generally reinsured the mortality risk on canadian term life insurance polices 
yrt reinsurance permits us to fix future mortality exposure at contractual rates by policy class 
to the extent actual mortality experience is more or less favorable than the contractual rate  the reinsurer will earn incremental profits or bear the incremental cost  as applicable 
in contrast to coinsurance  which is intended to eliminate all risks other than counterparty risk of the reinsurer and rewards associated with a specified percentage of the block of policies subject to the reinsurance arrangement  the yrt reinsurance arrangements we enter into are intended only to reduce volatility associated with variances between estimated and actual mortality rates 
on march   we entered into various coinsurance agreements with the citi reinsurers to cede between and of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year end as part of our corporate reorganization 
the effect of our reinsurance arrangements on ceded premiums and benefits and expenses on our statement of income follows ceded premiums 
ceded premiums are the premiums we pay to reinsurers 
these amounts are deducted from the direct premiums we earn to calculate our net premium revenues 
similar to direct premium revenues  ceded coinsurance premiums remain level over the initial term of the insurance policy 
ceded yrt premiums increase over the period that the policy has been in force 
accordingly  ceded yrt premiums generally constitute an increasing percentage of direct premiums over the policy term 
benefits and claims 
benefits and claims include incurred claim amounts and changes in future policy benefit reserves 
reinsurance reduces incurred claims in direct proportion to the percentage ceded 
amortization of dac 
amortization of dac is reduced on a pro rata basis for the business coinsured with citi 
there is no impact on amortization of dac associated with our yrt contracts 
insurance expenses 
insurance expenses are reduced by the allowances received from coinsurance  including the business reinsured with citi 
we may alter our reinsurance practices at any time due to the unavailability of yrt reinsurance at attractive rates or the availability of alternatives to reduce our risk exposure 
we presently intend to continue ceding approximately of our us mortality risk on new business issued subsequent to the citi reinsurance transactions 
net investment income 
term life insurance segment net investment income is composed of two elements allocated net investment income and the market return associated with the deposit asset underlying the reinsurance agreement we executed in connection with the transactions 
we allocate net investment income by applying the ratio of i the book value of the invested assets allocated to the term life insurance segment to the book value of the company s total invested assets to ii total net investment income  net of the income associated with the reinsurance agreement 
invested assets are allocated to the term life insurance segment based on the book value of the invested assets necessary to meet statutory reserve requirements and our targeted capital objectives 
net investment income is also impacted by the performance of our invested asset portfolio and the market return on the deposit asset which can be affected by interest rates  credit spreads and the mix of invested assets 
expenses 
results are also affected by variances in client acquisition  maintenance and administration expense levels 
investment and savings products segment 
our investment and savings products segment results are primarily driven by sales  the value of assets in client accounts for which we earn ongoing management  service and distribution fees and the number of fee generating accounts we administer 
sales 
we earn commissions and fees  such as dealer re allowances  and marketing and support fees  based on sales of mutual fund products and annuities 
sales of investment and savings products are influenced by the overall demand for investment products in the united states and canada  as well as by the size and productivity of our sales force 
we generally experience seasonality in our investment and savings products segment results due to our high concentration of sales of retirement account products 
while we believe the size of our sales force is a factor in driving sales volume in this segment  there are a number of other variables  such as economic and market conditions  that may have a significantly greater effect on sales volume in any given fiscal period 
asset values in client accounts 
we earn marketing and distribution fees trail commissions or  with respect to us mutual funds  b fees and management fees on mutual fund  annuity  managed account and segregated funds products 
table of contents based on asset values in client accounts 
our investment and savings products primarily consist of funds composed of equity securities 
asset values are influenced by new product sales  ongoing contributions to existing accounts  redemptions and changes in equity markets  net of expenses 
accounts 
we earn recordkeeping fees for administrative functions we perform on behalf of several of our mutual fund providers and custodial fees for services as a non bank custodian for certain of our mutual fund clients retirement plan accounts 
sales mix 
while our investment and savings products all have similar long term earnings characteristics  our results in a given fiscal period will be affected by changes in the overall mix of products within these broad categories 
examples of changes in the sales mix that influence our results include the following sales of a higher proportion of mutual fund products of the several mutual fund families for which we act as recordkeeper will generally increase our earnings because we are entitled to recordkeeping fees on these accounts  sales of variable annuity products in the united states will generate higher revenues in the period such sales occur than sales of other investment products that either generate lower upfront revenues or  in the case of segregated funds  no upfront revenues  sales and administration of a higher proportion of mutual funds that enable us to earn marketing and support fees will increase our revenues and profitability  sales of a higher proportion of retirement products of several mutual fund families will tend to result in higher revenue generation due to our ability to earn custodial fees on these accounts  and sales of a higher proportion of managed accounts products will generally extend the length of time over which revenues can be earned because we are entitled to revenues based on assets under management for these accounts 
corporate and other distributed products segment 
we earn revenues and pay commissions and referral fees for various other insurance products  prepaid legal services and other financial products  all of which are originated by third parties 
nblic  our new york life insurance subsidiary  also underwrites a mail order student life policy and a short term disability benefit policy  neither of which is distributed by our sales force  and has in force policies from several discontinued lines of insurance 
the corporate and other distributed products segment is affected by corporate income and expenses not allocated to our other segments  net investment income other than net investment income allocated to our term life insurance segment  general and administrative expenses other than expenses that are allocated to our term life insurance or investment and savings products segments  management equity awards  equity awards granted to our sales force leaders at the time of our ipo  interest expense on the citi note and realized gains and losses on our invested asset portfolio 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap 
these principles are established primarily by the fasb 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
the most significant items on the balance sheet are based on fair value determinations  accounting estimates and actuarial determinations which are susceptible to changes in future periods and which affect our results of operations and financial position 
the estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position are those related to the valuation of investments  reinsurance  dac  future policy benefit reserves  and income taxes 
the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management s analyses and judgments 
subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results 
invested assets we hold primarily fixed maturity securities  including bonds and redeemable preferred stocks  and equity securities  including common and non redeemable preferred stock 
we have classified these invested assets as available for sale  except for the securities of our us broker dealer subsidiary  which we have classified as trading securities 
all of these 
table of contents securities are carried at fair value 
fair value 
fair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information 
we classify and disclose all invested assets carried at fair value in one of the following three categories level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets  and level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
as of each reporting period  we classify all invested assets in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
significant levels of estimation and judgment are required to determine the fair value of certain of our investments 
the factors influencing these estimations and judgments are subject to change in subsequent reporting periods 
the fair value and hierarchy classifications of our invested asset portfolio were as follows december  fair value of total dollars in thousands level invested assets level invested assets level invested assets total invested assets less than in assessing the fair value of our investments  we use a third party pricing service for approximately of our securities 
the remaining securities are primarily private securities valued using models based on observable inputs on public corporate spreads having similar tenors eg  sector  average life and quality rating and liquidity and yield based on quality rating  average life and treasury yields 
all data inputs come from observable data corroborated by independent third party sources 
in the absence of sufficient observable inputs  we utilize non binding broker quotes  which are reflected in our level classification 
we perform internal reasonableness assessments on fair value determinations within our portfolio throughout the month and at month end  including pricing variance analyses and comparisons to alternative pricing sources and benchmark returns 
if a fair value appears unusual relative to these assessments  we will re examine the inputs and may challenge a fair value assessment made by the pricing service 
if there is a known pricing error  we will request a reassessment by the pricing service 
if the pricing service is unable to perform the reassessment on a timely basis  we will determine the appropriate price by requesting a reassessment from an alternative pricing service or other qualified source as necessary 
we do not adjust quotes or prices except in a rare circumstance to resolve a known error 
for additional information  see notes  and to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
other than temporary impairments 
we recognize unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale portfolio as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary is both objective and subjective 
furthermore  this determination can involve a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for invested assets that are not actively traded in established markets 
we evaluate a number of factors when determining the impairment status of individual securities 
these factors include the economic condition of various industry segments and geographic locations and other areas of identified risk 
for available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position that we intend to sell or would more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis  we recognize an impairment charge for the difference between amortized cost and fair value as a realized investment loss in our statements of income 
for available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position for which we have no intent to sell and believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis  only the credit loss component of the difference between cost and fair value is recognized in earnings  while the remainder is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security 
for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows  including asset backed securities  we periodically 
table of contents update our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
securities that are in an unrealized loss position are reviewed at least quarterly for other than temporary impairment 
if the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized 
estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral 
projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral 
other categories of fixed income securities that are in an unrealized loss position are also reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other than temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors 
we consider a number of factors in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
these include actions taken by rating agencies  default by the issuer  the significance of the decline  the intent to sell and the ability to hold the investment until recovery of the amortized cost basis  as noted above  the time period during which the decline has occurred  an economic analysis of the issuer  the financial strength  liquidity  and recoverability of the issuer  and an analysis of the underlying collateral 
although no set formula is used in this process  the investment performance  collateral position  and continued viability of the issuer are significant measures that are considered 
the other than temporary impairment analysis that we perform on our equity securities primarily focuses on the severity of the unrealized loss as well as the length of time the security s fair value has been below amortized cost 
the other than temporary impairments that we recognized in realized investment gains as a charge to earnings were as follows year ended december  in thousands other than temporary impairments realized investment gains  including other than temporary impairments for additional information  see notes and to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
reinsurance we use reinsurance extensively 
we determine if a contract provides indemnification against loss or liability in relation to the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject 
we review all contractual terms  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject that may delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if we determine that the possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk will occur only under remote circumstances  we record the contract under the deposit method of accounting with the net amount receivable reflected in other assets on our consolidated and combined balance sheets 
the reinsurance contracts in effect at december   including the citi reinsurance agreements  meet us gaap risk transfer provisions  except as noted below 
ceded policy reserves and claims liabilities relating to insurance ceded under these contracts are shown as due from reinsurers in our balance sheets 
we believe that one of the citi reinsurance transactions a yrt transaction with an experience refund provision will have limited transfer of insurance risk and that there will be only a remote chance of loss under the contract 
as such  we have accounted for this agreement under the deposit method of accounting 
ceded premiums are treated as a reduction of direct premiums and are recognized when due to the assuming company 
ceded claims are treated as a reduction of direct benefits and are recognized when the claim is incurred on a direct basis 
ceded policy reserve changes are also treated as a reduction of benefits and are recognized during the applicable financial reporting period 
under yrt arrangements  we determine the ceded reserve by recognizing the cost of reinsurance as a level percentage of the direct premium collected 
the expected reinsurance cost is the expected reinsurance premium paid less expected reinsurance claims received 
we determine ceded future policy benefit reserves for coinsurance in the same manner as direct policy reserves 
we calculate claim liabilities and policy benefits consistently for all policies  regardless of whether or not the policy is reinsured 
once the direct claim liabilities are estimated  we estimate the amounts attributable to the reinsurers 
liabilities 
table of contents for unpaid reinsurance claims are produced from claims and reinsurance system records  which contain the relevant terms of the individual reinsurance contracts 
we monitor claims due from reinsurers to ensure that balances are settled on a timely basis 
we review incurred but not reported claims to ensure that appropriate amounts are ceded 
we analyze and monitor the creditworthiness of each of our reinsurers to minimize collection issues 
for additional information on reinsurance  see notes and to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs we defer the costs of acquiring new business to the extent that they vary with  and are primarily related to  the acquisition of such new business 
these costs mainly include commissions and policy issue expenses 
the recovery of such costs is dependent on the future profitability of the related policies  which  in turn  is dependent principally upon mortality  persistency  the expense of administering the business and investment returns  as well as upon certain economic variables  such as inflation 
dac is subject to recoverability testing on an annual basis or when circumstances indicate that recoverability is uncertain 
we make certain assumptions regarding persistency  expenses  interest rates and claims 
the assumptions for these types of products may not be modified  or unlocked  unless recoverability testing deems them to be inadequate 
we update assumptions for new business to reflect the most recent experience 
deferrable term life insurance policy acquisition costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to premium income 
if actual lapses or withdrawals are different from pricing assumptions for a particular period  dac amortization will be affected 
if the number of policies that lapse are higher than the number of policies that we expected to lapse in our pricing assumptions  approximately more of the existing dac balance will be amortized  which would have been equal to approximately million as of december  assuming such lapses were distributed proportionately among policies of all durations 
we believe that a lapse rate in the number of policies that is higher than the rate assumed in our pricing assumptions is a reasonably possible variation 
higher lapses in the early durations would have a greater effect on dac amortization since the dac balances are higher at the earlier durations 
differences in actual mortality rates compared to our pricing assumptions will not have a material effect on dac amortization 
due to the inherent uncertainties in making assumptions about future events  materially different experience from expected results in persistency or mortality could result in a material increase or decrease of dac amortization in a particular period 
deferrable acquisition costs for canadian segregated funds are amortized over the life of the policies in relation to historical and future estimated gross profits before amortization 
the gross profits and resulting dac amortization will vary with actual fund returns  redemptions and expenses 
in october  the fasb issued asu  accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
asu creates a more limited definition than the current guidance  which defines dac as those costs that vary with  and primarily relate to  the acquisition of insurance contracts 
under the revised definition  deferred acquisition costs include incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions that result directly from and are essential to the contract transaction s and would not have been incurred had the contract transaction s not occurred 
all other acquisition related costs  including unsuccessful acquisition and renewal efforts  will be charged to expense as incurred 
administrative costs  rent  depreciation  occupancy  equipment  and all other general overhead costs are considered indirect costs and will be charged to expense as incurred 
the update allows either prospective or retrospective adoption and is required to be adopted for our fiscal year beginning january  we plan to retrospectively adopt asu we are still evaluating the full impact of implementing this guidance 
however  we currently estimate that adoption will reduce our dac balance by approximately to or in the range of million to million as of december  in connection with the citi reinsurance transactions  we ceded approximately billion of our dac balances in march of as a result of our retrospective adoption  dac amortization will be lower in periods following the citi reinsurance transactions 
as we rebuild our base of life policies issued subsequent to the citi reinsurance transactions  the concurrent increase in non deferred acquisition expenses likely will exceed the reduction in dac amortization  thereby resulting in a net increase in total benefits and expenses 
for additional information on dac  see notes and to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
future policy benefits we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders based on actuarial assumptions and in accordance with industry practice and us gaap 
liabilities for future policy benefits on our term life insurance products have been computed using a net level method  including assumptions as to investment yields  mortality  persistency  and other assumptions based on our experience 
many factors can affect these reserves  including mortality trends  investment yields and persistency 
similar to the dac discussion above  we cannot modify the assumptions used to establish reserves during the policy term unless recoverability testing deems them to be inadequate 
therefore  the reserves we establish are based on estimates  assumptions and our analysis of historical experience 
our results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we 
table of contents used in determining our reserves and pricing our products 
our reserve assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and  therefore  are inherently uncertain 
if actual lapses are different from pricing assumptions for a particular period  the change in the future policy benefits  which is reflected in benefits and claims in our statements of income  will be affected 
if the number of policies that lapse are higher than the number of policies that we expected to lapse in our pricing assumptions  approximately more of the future policy benefit reserves will be released  which would have been equal to approximately million as of december  assuming such lapses were distributed proportionately among policies of all durations 
the future policy benefit reserves released from the additional lapses would have been offset by the release of the corresponding reinsurance reserves of approximately million as of december  higher lapses in later durations would have a greater effect on the release of future policy benefit reserves since the future policy benefit reserves are higher at the later durations 
differences in actual mortality rates compared to our pricing assumptions will not have a material effect on future policy benefit reserves 
we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments

income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to i differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and ii operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary difference will reverse

total revenues 
total revenues declined in primarily as a result of the transactions 
excluding approximately million of revenues in that would have been recognized by citi had the transactions been effected on january   total revenues would have increased approximately million  or  compared with pro forma basis this increase primarily reflects incremental premiums on new term policies issued subsequent to the citi reinsurance transactions new term and an increase in commissions and fees  largely driven by increased sales of variable annuities in our investment and savings product segment 
the increase in total revenues relative to pro forma basis was partially offset by the decline in realized investment gains relative to realized investment gains in were largely driven by sales of invested assets in anticipation of our corporate reorganization

excluding approximately million of benefits and expenses in that would have been recognized by citi had the transactions been effected on january   total benefits and expenses would have increased approximately million  or  compared with pro forma basis the increase in total benefits and expenses was primarily a result of the growth in our term life and investment and savings products businesses and higher overall operating expenses  including the build out of incremental functions  processes and expenses associated with becoming a public company 
the increase in benefits and claims and amortization of dac  after giving effect to the transactions  was largely a result of the continued growth in our term life business following the citi reinsurance transactions 
sales commissions were higher consistent with the increase in commission and fee revenue noted in total revenues above

direct premiums 
direct premiums increased in primarily as a result of growth in new term business and premium increases for policies reaching the end of their initial level premium period 
the growth in direct premiums was consistent with the growth in face amount in force 
ceded premiums 
the increase in ceded premiums primarily reflects the impact of the citi reinsurance transactions and the net impact of the ceded premium recoveries discussed in note to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
adjusting for approximately million of additional premiums that would have been ceded to citi in had the citi reinsurance transactions been effected on january   ceded premium would have decreased approximately million  or  reflecting continued run off of the business ceded to citi  partially offset by age based increases in yrt reinsurance premiums

excluding the impact of this charge  the growth in benefits and claims outpaced net premium growth primarily as a result of slightly higher mortality experience 
amortization of dac 
the decrease in amortization of dac was largely attributable to the citi reinsurance and reorganization transactions 
excluding approximately million of dac amortization that would have been recognized by the citi reinsurers in had the citi reinsurance transactions been effected on january   dac amortization would have increased approximately million  or 
the growth in dac amortization was lower than the growth in net premiums primarily due to the inclusion of a dac adjustment of approximately million in the first quarter of largely related to in force business ceded to the citi reinsurers 
insurance expenses 
insurance expenses decreased largely as a result of the citi reinsurance transactions 
excluding approximately million of expense allowances that would have been recognized in had the transactions been effected on january   insurance expenses would have increased approximately million  or 
this increase in insurance expenses largely reflects the impact of premium related taxes  licenses and fees growth  expense allowance run off in the block of business ceded to citi  expenses associated with convention initiatives  including the iba fee promotion and the write off of medical testing materials  and build out of management compensation and benefits expense post ipo 
these items were partially offset by the release of management incentive compensation accruals for compensation earned in but paid in at a lower rate than had been anticipated 
product sales and face amount in force

commissions and fees increased primarily as a result of economic and market trends and client demand 
the increase in sales based revenues reflect the impact of internal exchanges for the variable annuity products we offer 
these internal exchanges were primarily driven by client redemptions of older variable annuity 
table of contents contracts to purchase the current prime elite iv variable annuity  which offers an attractive guaranteed income living benefit 
asset based revenues were driven by higher average asset values during even though end of period asset values were slightly lower than account based revenues were relatively flat compared with as the impact of a recordkeeping fee structure change on certain accounts  which had no net effect on income before income taxes  was largely offset by a decline in the number of accounts for which we provide record keeping services 
amortization of dac 
the increase in the rate of dac amortization was primarily driven by the impact of lower investment returns on our canadian segregated funds products 
growth in account values also led to higher dac amortization 
sales commissions 
the increase in sales based commissions was primarily driven by the increases in commissions and fees noted above 
sales based commission expense lagged the growth in sales based commission and fees revenue largely as a result of internal exchanges for variable annuities 
while the commissions that we receive and then pay to our sales representatives for internal exchange transactions are proportionately lower than those paid for a new sale  sales related marketing and support fees from internal exchanges are received in full with no associated impact on sales commissions expense 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased primarily as a result of growth in the business  expenses related to new product introductions  various government relations efforts and the recordkeeping fee structure change noted above in commissions and fees

lower yields on invested assets also negatively impacted net investment income during commissions and fees 
the increase in commissions and fees in was primarily driven by activity in our investment and savings product segment as a result of improved market conditions and increased demand for our products  partially offset by declines in our lending business as reflected in our corporate and other distributed products segment results 
total benefits and expenses 
the decrease in total benefits and expenses in primarily reflects lower benefits and claims  lower amortization of dac and lower insurance expenses largely as a result of the citi reinsurance agreements

notes to the pro forma statement of income unaudited the actual statement of income included income attributable to the underlying policies that were reinsured to citi on march  as well as net investment income earned on the invested assets backing the reinsurance balances and the distributions to citi made as part of our corporate reorganization 
adjustments for the citi reinsurance transactions 
concurrent with the reorganization of our business and prior to completion of the ipo  we formed a new subsidiary  prime re  and we made an initial capital contribution to it 
we also entered into a series of coinsurance agreements with prime re and with other citi subsidiaries 
under these agreements  we ceded between and of the risks 
table of contents and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at december  concurrent with signing these agreements  we transferred the corresponding account balances in respect of the coinsured policies along with the assets to support the statutory liabilities assumed by prime re and the other citi subsidiaries 
we believe that three of the citi coinsurance agreements  which we refer to as the risk transfer agreements  satisfy us gaap risk transfer rules 
under the risk transfer agreements  we ceded between and of our term life future policy benefit reserves  and we transferred a corresponding amount of invested assets to the citi reinsurers 
these transactions did not and will not impact our future policy benefit reserves  and we recorded an asset for the same amount of risk transferred in due from reinsurers 
we also reduced deferred acquisition costs by between and  which will reduce future amortization expenses 
in addition  we will transfer between and of all future premiums and benefits and claims associated with these policies to the corresponding reinsurance entities 
we will receive ongoing ceding allowances as a reduction to insurance expenses to cover policy and claims administration expenses under each of these reinsurance contracts 
one coinsurance agreement  which we refer to as the deposit agreement  relates to a reinsurance transaction that includes an experience refund provision and does not satisfy us gaap risk transfer rules 
we account for this contract under the deposit method 
under deposit method accounting  the amount we pay to the reinsurer will be treated as a deposit and is reported on the balance sheet as an asset in other assets 
the citi coinsurance agreements did not generate any deferred gain or loss upon their execution because these transactions were part of a business reorganization among entities under common control 
the net impact of these transactions was reflected as an increase in paid in capital 
prior to the completion of the ipo  we effected a reorganization in which we transferred all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of prime re to citi 
each of the assets and liabilities  including the invested assets and the distribution of prime re  was transferred at book value with no gain or loss recorded on our income statement 
for the year ended december   the pro forma statement of income assumes the reinsurance transactions were effected as of january  for policies in force as of year end a reflects premiums ceded to the citi reinsurers for the specific policies covered under the risk transfer agreements 
b reflects net investment income on a pro rata share of invested assets transferred to the citi reinsurers 
the net investment income was estimated by multiplying the actual investment income by the ratio of the amount of assets transferred to our total portfolio of invested assets 
the amount also includes the change in fair value of the deposit asset related to the reinsurance agreement being accounted for under the deposit method 
c reflects benefits and claims ceded to the citi reinsurers for the specific policies covered under the risk transfer agreements 
d reflects the dac amortization ceded to the citi reinsurers for the specific policies covered under the risk transfer agreements 
e reflects the non deferred expense allowance received from the citi reinsurers under the risk transfer agreements 
f reflects a finance charge payable to the citi reinsurer in respect of the deposit agreement 
the annual finance charge is of our excess reserves 
excess reserves are equal to the difference between our required statutory reserves and our economic reserves  which is the amount we determine is necessary to satisfy obligations under our in force policies 
g reflects income tax at the respective period s effective tax rate 
adjustments for the reorganization and other concurrent transactions 
the pro forma statement of income for the year ended december  assumes the reorganization transactions were executed as of january  h reflects a pro rata reduction of net investment income on assets distributed to citi as an extraordinary distribution 
i reflects interest expense on a million  interest note payable issued to citi 
j reflects expense associated with equity awards granted on april  in connection with the ipo 
the million expense reflects one quarter of vesting related to management awards that continue to vest over three years 
these expenses are reflected in actual results for periods following the ipo

table of contents volume 
ceded premiums  which are highly influenced by the business reinsured with citi  grew consistent with direct premiums 
additionally  in  we reduced ceded premiums by approximately million related to agreements obtained with certain reinsurers to recover ceded premiums for post issue underwriting class upgrades 
the most common reason for such an upgrade occurs when someone who was originally issued a term life policy as a tobacco user subsequently quits using tobacco 
historically  we have reduced policyholder premiums for such upgrades  but have not reduced ceded premiums to reflect the new underwriting class 
we were uncertain of our ability to recover past ceded premiums  but in the fourth quarter of  we approached our reinsurers and reached agreements to recover certain of these past ceded premiums 
the million of recoveries recognized in reflects the agreements signed in the fourth quarter of we recovered million of past ceded premiums  which included million of recoveries passed on to the citi reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the associated reinsurance agreements 
we received approximately million of additional recoveries in the first quarter of for the remaining agreements which were signed in january allocated net investment income decreased during  primarily due to lower yield on invested assets and slightly lower average allocated invested assets  partially offset by lower investment related expenses 
the increase in benefits and claims in was primarily due to higher reserve increases as a result of improvements in policy persistency and premium growth 
claims were slightly higher during due to favorable claims experience in the first quarter of in  amortization of dac decreased largely due to improved policy persistency  partially offset by higher amortization from a lower dac interest rate assumed for new business 
we lowered the interest rate assumption during the third quarter of to reflect rates available in the current interest rate environment 
the new lower dac interest rate assumption will increase dac amortization in the near term 
the decline in insurance commissions expense in was largely due to the million special sales force payment made in insurance expenses were relatively flat primarily reflecting the offsetting effects of a decline in compensation related items in  payments made in for contract buyouts associated with our canceled convention  and an increase in taxes  licenses and fees expense in the increase in taxes  licenses and fees in was primarily driven by accruals recognized in the fourth quarter as a result of recognizing these items on the accrual basis of accounting

the in force book increased billion  or  during issued face amount decreased billion  or approximately  due to a lower average issued policy size and the effect on production of a slightly smaller base of sales representatives 
terminations decreased by billion in  primarily as a result of improved persistency relative to the decrease in the effect of foreign currency on the end of period face amount in force was largely due to the significant strengthening in the canadian dollar experienced during the increase in face in force in did not keep pace with the increase in premiums primarily due to the effect of increased premiums with no corresponding change in face amount and unchanged face amounts on policies reaching the end of their initial level premium period

financial condition investments 
we have an investment committee composed of members of our senior management team that is responsible for establishing and maintaining our investment guidelines and supervising our investment activity 
our investment committee regularly monitors our overall investment results and our compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines 
we use a third party investment adviser to manage our investing activities 
our investment adviser reports to our investment committee 
we follow a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets and provide adequate liquidity 
in an effort to meet business needs and mitigate risks  our investment guidelines provide restrictions on our portfolio s composition  including limits on asset type  sector limits  credit quality limits  portfolio duration  limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types 
we may also direct our investment managers to invest some of our invested asset portfolio in currencies other than the us dollar 
for example  a portion of our portfolio is invested in assets denominated in canadian dollars which  at minimum  would equal our reserves for policies denominated in canadian dollars 
additionally  to help ensure adequate liquidity for payment of claims  we take 
table of contents into account the maturity and duration of our invested asset portfolio and our general liability profile 
our invested asset portfolio is subject to a variety of risks  including risks related to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
investment guideline restrictions have been established to minimize the effect of these risks but may not always be effective due to factors beyond our control 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in significant losses  realized or unrealized  in the value of our invested asset portfolio 
additionally  with respect to some of our investments  we are subject to prepayment and  therefore  reinvestment risk 
in november  we executed an agreement with citi to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately million the repurchase transaction 
the repurchase transaction  which was funded with the proceeds from a dividend paid by primerica life  was completed in november the dividend from primerica life to the parent company was funded through sales of investments and available cash 
the changes to asset mix  duration and overall credit quality of our invested asset portfolio were not meaningful 
however  with the reduction in our consolidated cash and invested assets as a result of the repurchase transaction  we expect net investment income to decline 
our average book yield at december  increased modestly  as the investments sold to fund the dividend generally had yields that were lower than the average book yield on the pre dividend invested assets portfolio 
details on asset mix were as follows december  december  fair value amortized cost fair value amortized cost us government and agencies foreign government states and political subdivisions corporates mortgage and asset backed securities equity securities trading securities cash and cash equivalents total the composition and duration of our portfolio will vary depending on several factors  including the yield curve and our opinion of the relative value among various asset classes

other significant assets and liabilities 
the balances of and changes in other significant assets and liabilities were as follows december  change dollars in thousands due from reinsurers deferred policy acquisition costs  net future policy benefits current income tax payable deferred income taxes due from reinsurers 
due from reinsurers reflects future policy benefit reserves due from third party reinsurers  including the citi reinsurers 
such amounts are reported as due from reinsurers rather than offsetting future policy benefits 
the increase in due from reinsurers was largely driven by growth in our new term business partially offset by the run off in the block of business ceded to citi 
deferred policy acquisition costs  net 
the increase in dac was primarily a result of growth in commissions and expenses deferred as a result of new business 
future policy benefits 
the increase in future policy benefits was primarily a result of the aging of and growth in our in force book of business 
current income tax payable and deferred income taxes 
our effective tax rate was relatively flat compared with as such  current income tax payable declined largely due to the decrease in earnings subsequent to our corporate reorganization

off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in the rules and regulations of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources dividends and other payments to us from our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash 
the primary uses of funds by the parent company include the payment of general operating expenses  the payment of dividends and the payment of principal and interest to citi under the citi note 
the liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries principally relate to the liabilities associated with their distribution and underwriting of insurance products including the payment of claims  distribution of investment and savings products  operating expenses  income taxes and the payment of dividends 
historically  our insurance subsidiaries have used cash flow from operations associated with our in force book of term life insurance to fund their liquidity requirements 
our insurance subsidiaries principal cash inflows from operating activities are derived from policyholder premiums and investment income earned on invested assets that support our statutory capital and reserves 
we also derive cash inflows from the distribution of investment and savings products and other products 
our principal outflows relate to payments for ceded premiums and benefits and claims 
the principal cash inflows from investment activities result from repayments of principal and investment income  while the principal outflows relate to purchases of fixed maturity securities 
we typically hold cash sufficient to fund operating flows  and invest any excess cash 
our distribution and underwriting of term life insurance place significant demands on our liquidity  particularly when we experience growth 
we pay a substantial majority of the sales commission during the first year following the sale of a policy 
our underwriting activities also require significant cash outflows at the inception of a policy s term 
following and as a result of the citi reinsurance transactions without giving effect to any other factors  the cash flows from our retained in force book of term life insurance policies were significantly lower 
this has reduced our operating cash flows for the near to intermediate term  however  we anticipate that cash flows from our businesses  including our existing block of policies and our investment and savings products  will continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements 
over the next few years  we expect our growing premium revenue base from policies issued after the citi reinsurance transactions to increase operating cash flows 
significant transactions 
in april  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that enables us to offer and sell to the public our equity and debt securities from time to time as we may determine and enables certain of our significant stockholders to resell our shares of common stock held by them 
specific information regarding the terms and securities which may be offered pursuant to this registration statement will be provided at the time of such offering 
net proceeds of any offering of securities by us pursuant to this registration statement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness or repurchases of shares of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to this registration statement  citi sold an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market in april and december  which significantly increased the public float of our common stock 
in october  we received notification that the massachusetts doi had approved primerica life s request to pay a million cash dividend to the parent company 
the dividend was paid in november and funded via sales of invested assets and available cash 
in november  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the per share purchase price was determined based on the volume weighted average price per share of primerica common stock during the seven day period prior to execution of the repurchase agreement 
we funded the repurchase transaction with the funds from primerica life s dividend to the parent company 
we may seek to enhance our liquidity position or capital structure through borrowings from third party sources  sales of debt or equity securities  reserve financing or some combination of these sources 
the model regulation entitled valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as regulation xxx  requires insurers to carry statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees which are often significantly in excess of the reserves that insurers deem necessary to satisfy claim obligations 
accordingly  many insurance companies have sought ways to reduce their capital needs by financing these excess reserves through bank financing  reinsurance arrangements and other financing transactions 
we have completed a substantial amount of the work necessary to execute a xxx redundant reserve financing that could generate statutory capital for distribution to the parent company 
we are continuing to work on a xxx redundant reserve financing transaction and to evaluate how other capital options may fit into our capital strategy 
as a result  no assurance is given as to whether such a transaction will be executed and  if executed  the structure  timing  and amount of any such transaction 
cash flows 
cash flows from operating activities are affected primarily by the timing of premiums received  commissions and fees received  benefits paid  commissions paid to sales representatives  administrative and selling expenses  investment income  and cash taxes 
our principal source of cash historically has been premiums received on term life 
table of contents insurance policies in force 
we typically generate positive cash flows from operating activities  as premiums  net investment income  commissions and fees collected from our insurance and investment and savings products exceed benefits  commissions and operating expenses paid  and we invest the excess 
the components of the changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was higher in largely due to higher income tax payments and other intercompany settlements paid to citi in in connection with the transactions 
the effect of these items were partially offset by lower net investment income in  primarily as a result of the transactions 
net cash provided by operating activities for also reflects approximately million of net purchases of trading securities by our broker dealer subsidiary  compared with approximately million of net sales and maturities in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for  compared with was primarily the result of lower net cash flows on our term life insurance business and lower net investment income  both of which were substantially impacted by the citi reinsurance transactions and our corporate reorganization 
additionally  there was an increase in income taxes paid in connection with the citi reinsurance transactions 
these cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in cash provided by our investment and savings products due to improved sales and higher values of client accounts on which we earn fees 
investing activities 
the decline in cash provided by investing activities in primarily reflects the impact of securities sales during the first quarter of as we increased our cash position to fund distributions to citi in connection with the transactions 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities for  compared with was primarily the result of significant securities sales activity and lower securities purchases as we increased our cash position in anticipation of the transactions 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to the impact of the distributions paid to citi in connection with the transactions as well as the first quarter of payment of the dividend declared to citi 
net cash used in financing activities in also reflects the repurchase of our common stock from citi in november the increase in cash used in financing activities for  compared with represents the cash payment of dividends paid to citi as part of the transactions  the cash portion of the citi dividend declared in december and paid in january  and the dividends to stockholders declared and paid in the third and fourth quarters of citi note 
in april  we issued the million citi note as part of our corporate reorganization 
prior to the issuance of the citi note  we had no outstanding debt 
the citi note bears interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july  and matures march  we have the option to redeem the citi note in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the terms of the citi note also require us to use our commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and consummate an offering of investment grade debt securities  trust preferred securities  surplus notes  hybrid securities or convertible debt that generates sufficient net cash proceeds to repay the citi note in full at certain mutually agreeable dates  based on certain conditions 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the citi note at december  no events of default or defaults occurred during the year ended december  we calculate our debt to capital ratio by dividing total long term debt by the sum of stockholders equity and total long term debt 
as of december   our debt to capital ratio was

the naic has established rbc standards for us life insurers  as well as a risk based capital model act the rbc model act that has been adopted by the insurance regulatory authorities 
the rbc model act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their rbc based upon four categories of risk asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the capital requirement for each is determined by applying factors that vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset  premiums and reserve items 
the formula is an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action 
as of december   our us life insurance subsidiaries had statutory capital substantially in excess of the applicable statutory requirements to support existing operations and to fund future growth 
following the november million dividend from primerica life to the parent company  primerica life s rbc ratio remained well positioned to support existing operations and fund future growth 
in canada  an insurer s minimum capital requirement is overseen by osfi and determined as the sum of the capital requirements for five categories of risk asset default risk  mortality morbidity lapse risks  changes in interest rate environment risk  segregated funds risk and foreign exchange risk 
as of december   primerica life canada was in compliance with canada s minimum capital requirements as determined by osfi 
securities lending 
we participate in securities lending transactions with brokers to increase investment income with minimal risk 
see notes and to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information 
short term borrowings 
we had no short term borrowings as of or during the year ended december  contractual obligations 
our contractual obligations  including payments due by period  were as follows december  total liability total payments less than year years years more than years in millions future policy benefits policy claims and other benefits payable other policyholder funds citi note commissions purchase obligations operating lease obligations n a current income tax payable total contractual obligations our liability for future policy benefits represents the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid  less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected 
net premiums represent the portion of gross premiums required to provide for all benefits and associated expenses 
these benefit payments are contingent on policyholders 
table of contents continuing to renew their policies and make their premium payments 
our contractual obligations table discloses the impact of benefit payments that will be due assuming the underlying policy renewals and premium payments continue as expected in our actuarial models 
the future policy benefits represented in the table are presented on an undiscounted basis  gross of any amounts recoverable through reinsurance agreements and gross of any premiums to be collected 
we expect to fully fund the obligations for future policy benefits from cash flows from general account invested assets and from future premiums 
these estimations are based on mortality and lapse assumptions comparable with our historical experience 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results 
policy claims and other benefits payable represents claims and benefits currently owed to policyholders 
other policyholders funds primarily represent claim payments left on deposit with us 
commissions represent gross  undiscounted commissions that we expect to incur  contingent on the policyholders continuing to renew their policies and make their premium payments as noted above 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
these obligations consist primarily of accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities  including committed funds related to meetings and conventions for our independent sales force  plus a variety of vendor commitments funding our ongoing business operations 
our operating lease obligations primarily relate to office and warehouse space and office equipment 
in september  we signed an agreement to lease a new build to suit facility which will replace and consolidate substantially all of our existing duluth  georgia based executive and home office operations 
we expect the building to be complete and ready for occupancy in the second quarter of the initial lease term will be years with estimated minimum annual rental payments ranging from approximately million at inception to approximately million in year the leases covering our existing duluth  georgia based executive and home office operations will terminate in the second quarter of as such  we do not expect a material increase in our operating lease expenditures  however the period over which we are contractually obligated for the executive and home office lease will extend to for additional information concerning our commitments and contingencies  see note to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of the loss of fair value resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying financial instruments are traded 
sensitivity analysis measures the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market rates or prices on the profitability of market sensitive financial instruments 
the following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates and canadian currency exchange rates is based on shock tests  which model the effects of interest rate and canadian exchange rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe shock tests provide the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the sec  they are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by their inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
although the following results of shock tests for changes in interest rates and canadian currency exchange rates may have some limited use as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
these disclosures also are selective in nature and address  in the case of interest rates  only the potential direct impact on our financial instruments  and in the case of canadian currency exchange rates  the potential translation impact on net income from our canadian subsidiaries 
they do not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of these changes in interest rates and canadian currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
the fair value of the fixed maturity securities in our invested asset portfolio as of december  was billion 
the primary market risk for this portion of our invested asset portfolio is interest rate risk 
one means of assessing the exposure of our fixed maturity securities portfolios to interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential changes in market value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points across all maturities 
this model is sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve 
under this model  with all other factors constant and assuming no offsetting change in the value of our liabilities  we estimated that such an increase in interest rates would cause the market value of our fixed maturity securities portfolios to decline by approximately million  or 
based on our actual securities positions as of december  
table of contents canadian currency risk 
we also have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk to the extent we conduct business in canada 
for the year ended december   of our revenues from operations  excluding realized investment gains  were generated by our canadian operations 
a strong canadian dollar relative to the us dollar results in higher levels of reported revenues  expenses  net income  assets  liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our us dollar financial statements and a weaker canadian dollar has the opposite effect 
historically  we have not hedged this exposure  although we may elect to do so in future periods 
one means of assessing exposure to changes in canadian currency exchange rates is to model the effects on reported income using a sensitivity analysis 
we analyzed our canadian currency exposure for the year ended december  net exposure was measured assuming a decrease in canadian currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
we estimated that such a decrease would decrease our net income before income taxes for the year ended december  by approximately million
