item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a portfolio of internally discovered product candidates for the potential treatment of neurological disorders 
our innovative product candidates are prodrugs that are typically created by modifying the chemical structure of currently marketed drugs  referred to as parent drugs  and are designed to correct limitations in the oral absorption  distribution and or metabolism of the parent drug 
we intend to focus our development and commercialization efforts on potential treatments of diseases with significant unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on central nervous system disorders 
our marketed product and each of our product candidates is an orally available  patented or patentable new chemical entity that addresses potential markets with clear unmet medical needs 
in april  the us food and drug administration  or fda  approved our first product  known in the united states as horizant gabapentin enacarbil extended release tablets  for the treatment of moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome  or rls  in adults 
restless legs syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs  usually caused or accompanied by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs 
glaxo group limited  or gsk  holds commercialization rights and certain development rights for horizant in the united states 
in july  gsk began promoting horizant for the treatment of rls in the united states and recorded net sales of million for the year ended december  under our collaboration agreement with gsk  as currently in effect  all allowable expenses and sales of horizant are accounted for using a joint profit and loss  or p l  statement  in which we and gsk share in the resulting operating pre tax profits and losses 
our share of losses from the joint p l will be forgiven up to a maximum of million  of which approximately million had been forgiven through december  our payment of additional losses  if any  would be deferred and payable without interest over a four year period of time following the first quarter in which the joint p l is profitable 
gsk is responsible for the us development of horizant for rls and postherpetic neuralgia  or phn  a chronic type of neuropathic pain that can follow the resolution of shingles 
in august  gsk filed a supplemental new drug application  or snda  with the fda under section b for horizant for the potential management of phn 
in october  the fda accepted the snda for review and set a prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  date of june  as a goal for the completion of their review of the snda 
because june  is a saturday  the effective action date is expected to be friday  june  we are eligible to receive a million milestone payment from gsk associated with the possible approval of the phn snda  assuming such approval occurs and the collaboration agreement with gsk is effective at the time of such approval 
in january  we provided a notice of dispute and notice of breach and termination  or the notice  to gsk that provided notice of our belief that  among other matters  gsk has materially breached its contractual obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to i maximize the sales of horizant in an expeditious manner and ii achieve the sales milestones set forth in our collaboration agreement 
the notice provides that the termination of the collaboration agreement would become effective at the end of the day notice period provided under the agreement  which will expire on april   unless gsk has cured any such breach or default prior to such date 
however  on february   gsk filed a complaint  or the gsk complaint  in the united states district court for the district of delaware naming us and other unspecified individuals as defendants 
pursuant to the gsk complaint  gsk is seeking declaratory judgment that it is not in breach of the collaboration agreement and that we do not have the right to terminate the collaboration agreement as a result of gsk s performance under the agreement to date 
following the expiration of the contractually specified period of time for resolution of the dispute by the requisite officers of the parties  on february   we filed a complaint  or the xenoport complaint  in the superior court of the state of california in the county of santa clara against gsk and its affiliates  glaxosmithkline llc and glaxosmithkline holdings americas inc  for breach of contract  fraud  breach of fiduciary duty  breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unfair competition 
pursuant to the xenoport complaint  in addition to injunctive and equitable relief  we are seeking damages for lost profits  damage to the value of horizant and unattained royalties and milestone payments in an amount to be proven at 
table of contents trial  as well as punitive damages and restitution 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the gsk complaint  and prosecute the xenoport complaint  vigorously 
we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation related to the gsk complaint and the xenoport complaint or when or if the collaboration agreement will be terminated or the ultimate terms of any termination of the agreement 
in addition  we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with this litigation  and may not prevail in either of these legal proceedings 
if our collaboration agreement with gsk is terminated  we may not be entitled to any further milestone payments  royalties or joint p l loss forgiveness or deferral  and we could be responsible for the cost of additional horizant commercialization and development activities  including post marketing commitments  which could accelerate our need for additional capital 
gabapentin enacarbil is licensed to astellas pharma inc in japan and five other asian countries 
in january  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare approved astellas nda for the use of gabapentin enacarbil  which will be known as regnite in japan  as a treatment for patients with rls 
we are evaluating our second product candidate  arbaclofen placarbil  or ap  as a potential treatment for patients with spasticity 
we are conducting a pivotal phase clinical trial under a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the fda  for ap as a potential treatment for spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis  or ms 
provided a positive outcome from this trial is achieved  along with supportive data from certain additional planned studies  we intend to file an nda under section b 
section b allows reference to published literature and the fda s previous finding of safety and effectiveness for baclofen  a drug that has been approved by the fda for the alleviation of signs and symptoms of spasticity in individuals with ms and may also be of some value in patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases 
we anticipate reporting top line results from this trial near the end of we also evaluated ap for the potential adjunctive treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd 
following the results in march of a phase clinical trial of ap as adjunctive therapy in patients with gerd who do not experience complete relief of gerd symptoms while being treated with proton pump inhibitors  we determined that the efficacy results of this trial  which did not meet the primary endpoint  did not warrant our investment in further development for ap in gerd at the present time 
we have evaluated our third product candidate  xp  for the potential treatment of patients with parkinson s disease who experience motor fluctuations 
in december  we reported preliminary top line results of a phase clinical trial of patient optimized doses of our new bi layer tablet of xp carbidopa compared to patient optimized doses of sinemet levodopa carbidopa 
results of the study indicated that xp carbidopa dosed three times per day reduced mean daily off time by compared to baseline when the patients were taking their pre trial sinemet dosing regimen 
however  in the primary analysis of the trial  the improvement with xp carbidopa was not statistically better than the improvement seen with optimized sinemet dosed four or five times per day during the double blind phase of the trial 
at this time  we plan to defer further investment in this program pending the outcome of additional data analysis and discussions with parkinson s disease experts and possibly with regulatory authorities 
in august  we announced plans to accelerate the development of our preclinical product candidate  xp  as a potential treatment for relapsing remitting ms  or rrms  with a goal of filing an investigational new drug application  or ind  in the second quarter of xp is a new chemical entity that is a prodrug of monomethyl fumarate  or mmf  a molecule that appears to have anti inflammatory properties and the potential to modulate cellular responses to oxidative stress 
in addition to our development and commercialization agreements with gsk for horizant and with astellas for regnite  we plan to enter into other agreements with pharmaceutical companies for our product candidates when access to a primary care physician sales force is necessary to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates in the united states  for the development and commercialization of our product candidates outside the united states  or to develop and commercialize product candidates that fall outside our core focus 
we believe that our existing capital resources and anticipated milestone payments  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the third quarter of this estimate assumes receipt of a potential million milestone payment from gsk associated with the possible approval of horizant for the management of phn  assuming such approval occurs and the collaboration agreement with gsk is effective at the time of such approval 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to each of our critical accounting areas 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we currently have collaboration agreements with astellas and gsk  each of which contains multiple elements 
we account for these agreements entered into  or materially modified  through december  in accordance with the provisions of the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  or the codification 
we considered a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the various elements could be considered separate units of accounting  whether there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements and whether there was a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of accounting standards update  or asu   multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which is included within the codification as revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  on a prospective basis 
under the provisions of asu  we will no longer rely on objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the elements in a revenue arrangement in order to separate a deliverable into a separate unit of accounting  and the use of the residual method has been eliminated 
we will instead use a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which will be used to determine the allocation of consideration to each unit of accounting under an arrangement 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the provisions of asu are applied by us to revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  beginning january  as of december   we had not applied the provisions of asu to any of our revenue arrangements as we had not entered into any new  or materially modified any of our existing  revenue arrangements in therefore  there was no material impact on our financial position or results of operations from adopting asu however  the provisions of asu could have a material impact on the revenue recognized from any collaboration agreements that we enter into  or materially modify  in future periods 
effective january   we also adopted the provisions of asu  milestone method of revenue recognition  or asu  which is included within the codification as revenue recognition milestone method 
the provisions of asu are being applied on a prospective basis for milestones achieved starting in the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in the year ended december   and the provisions of asu are not expected to have a material impact on the revenue recognized from any existing collaboration agreements 
where there are multiple deliverables combined as a single unit of accounting  revenues are deferred and recognized over the period that we remain obligated to perform services 
the specific methodology for the recognition of the revenue eg  straight line or according to specific performance criteria is determined on a case by case basis according to the facts and circumstances applicable to a given agreement 
we account for our revenue related activities as follows up front  licensing type fees 
to date  these types of fees have been classified within the collaboration agreements as license fees  access fees  rights fees and initial licensing fees  and each of them was 
table of contents non refundable and payable in connection with the execution of the contract 
up front  licensing type payments are assessed to determine whether or not the licensee is able to obtain any stand alone value from the license 
where this is not the case  we do not consider the license deliverable to be a separate unit of accounting  and we defer the revenue with revenue recognition for the license fee being assessed in conjunction with the other deliverables that constitute the combined unit of accounting 
milestones 
prior to our adoption of asu on january   we assessed milestones on an individual basis  and revenue was recognized from these milestones when earned  as evidenced by acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event was substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represented the culmination  or progress towards the culmination  of an earnings process and iii the milestone payment was non refundable 
milestones that were received after all substantive deliverables had occurred were considered to be bonus payments and were recognized when earned  assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria were met 
where separate milestones did not meet these criteria  we used a performance based model  with revenue recognition following delivery of effort as compared to an estimate of total expected effort 
effective january   under the provisions of asu  consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone can be recognized in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meets all the criteria for the milestone to be considered substantive at the inception of the arrangement 
for a milestone to be considered substantive  the consideration earned by achieving the milestone should i be commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relate solely to past performance and iii be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
for events for which the occurrences are contingent solely upon the passage of time or are the result of the collaborative partner s performance  the contingent payments will not be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of asu and will be recognized as revenue when payments are earned  the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we will assess the nature of and appropriate accounting for these payments on a case by case basis in accordance with the provisions of the revenue recognition topic of the codification 
profit and loss sharing 
this represents our share of the profits and losses from the co promotion of horizant with gsk 
amounts are recognized in the period in which the related activities occur  and their financial statement classification is based on our assessment that these activities constitute part of our ongoing central operations 
our current collaboration agreements also include potential payments for product royalties and detail reimbursements 
to date  we have not received any revenue from these activities 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimate at any particular balance sheet date by any material amount 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  
table of contents fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
fair value measurements we account for the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with the provisions of the fair value measurement topic of the codification 
the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  continue to be valued at fair value on a recurring basis 
as defined in the fair value measurement topic of the codification  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we apply the market approach valuation technique for fair value measurements on a recurring basis and attempt to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets and are classified at level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
stock based compensation the provisions of the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification establish accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
in accordance with the topic  for stock options  awards and stock purchase rights granted under the employee stock purchase plan  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  and the resulting charge is expensed using the straight line attribution method over the vesting period 
restricted stock units are measured at the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and expensed over the period of vesting using the straight line attribution approach 
the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived  exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
historically  we derived both the expected life and the expected stock price volatility assumptions using data obtained from similar entities  taking into consideration factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
on a prospective basis  beginning in the first quarter of  we have determined that our historical volatility can be used as a reasonable basis to derive the expected stock price volatility assumption and have applied our historical volatility when valuing employee stock options granted beginning in the first quarter of we account for stock compensation arrangements to non employees in accordance with the equity based payments to non employees topic of the codification  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as costs associated with our drug discovery efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
research and development expenses are comprised of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with i third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  ii third party manufacturing organizations  where a substantial portion of our preclinical supplies and all of our clinical supplies are produced and iii consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and amortization and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects  including our drug development programs 
we do not allocate our employee and infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
our current portfolio of marketed products and proprietary product candidates includes the marketed product and product candidates summarized in the table below 
the table summarizes development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product candidate in development and the direct  third party research and development expenses recognized in connection with our marketed product and each product candidate 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of current phase is our current estimate of the timing of completion of the current phase of development 
the actual timing of completion could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the our success also depends substantially on our advanced product candidates that are still under development 
if we or our collaborative partners are unable to bring any of these product candidates to market  or experience significant delays in doing so  our ability to generate product revenue and our likelihood of success will be reduced  if we or our partners are not able to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals  we or our partners will not be able to commercialize horizant  regnite or our product candidates  our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired and our business will not be successful  we depend on collaborations to complete the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
these collaborations may place the development of our product candidates outside our control  may require us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us  if we do not establish collaborations for our product candidates  we will have to alter our development and commercialization plans  if our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could severely harm our business  we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for  or commercialize  our product candidates  if third parties do not manufacture horizant  regnite or our product candidates in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost  commercialization of horizant  regnite and clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates would be harmed or delayed  if we are required to obtain alternate third party manufacturers  it could delay or prevent the clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates  and use of third party manufacturers may increase the risk that we or our partners will not have adequate supplies of our product candidates sections of risk factors

research expenses for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of personnel costs and office and facilities overhead costs 
as a result of our focus on advancement of our later stage product candidates and to reduce expenses  we eliminated our discovery research efforts in the remaining office and facilities overhead costs were reclassified to the preclinical and clinical development other expenses for the year ended december  the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investment in our research and development activities  including the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be critical to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of at least some of our product candidates 
in situations in which third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate  the estimated completion date is largely under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 

table of contents as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues our collaboration revenue consisted of the recognition of revenues from up front and milestone payments from our collaboration with astellas 
our net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities consisted of the recognition of revenues from up front and milestone payments and the recognition of our share of operating losses resulting from our election to co promote horizant in the united states with gsk 
in connection with the amendment and restatement of our collaboration agreement with gsk in november  our share of operating losses is forgiven up to a maximum of million  of which approximately million had been forgiven through december  pursuant to the agreement  gsk is responsible for recording sales of horizant in the united states 
for the year ended december   net sales in the united states of horizant as recorded by gsk were million 
year ended december  to change to change in thousands  except percentages net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities collaboration revenue total revenues the increase in net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the receipt and recognition of a million milestone payment from gsk in connection with the first shipment of horizant to a wholesaler and a million milestone payment from gsk in connection with the fda s acceptance for review of the snda under section b requesting approval of horizant for the potential management of phn 
the decrease in net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the receipt and recognition of a significant portion of milestone payments in the aggregate of million from gsk related to the fda s acceptance for review of the horizant nda in as a result of our amended and restated collaboration agreement with gsk in november  as currently in effect  our share of losses from the joint profit and loss is forgiven up to a maximum of million leading to the reversal in of the million loss recognized in the increase in collaboration revenue in compared to was due to the recognition of a million milestone payment from astellas in connection with fda approval of the horizant nda for rls 
the decrease in collaboration revenue in compared to was the result of an million decrease in revenues recognized in under our astellas agreement from milestone payments related to the fda s acceptance for review of the nda for horizant in the united states and the acceptance of filing of the nda for regnite with the pharmaceuticals and medical device agency in japan 
we expect revenues to fluctuate in the future primarily depending upon the commercialization and potential further development of horizant regnite gabapentin enacarbil  the timing of milestone related activities under our astellas and gsk collaborations and the extent to which we enter into new  or modify existing  collaborative agreements 
in the event our collaboration agreement with gsk terminates and commercialization rights to horizant reverts to us  we expect revenues to fluctuate in our efforts to market and sell horizant or enter into agreements with third parties to do so

the decrease in research and development expenses for compared to was principally due to the following decreased net costs for horizant regnite gabapentin enacarbil of million primarily due to decreased manufacturing and clinical costs  decreased net costs for xp of million primarily due to decreased toxicology costs  and decreased personnel costs of million primarily due to decreased headcount  including decreased non cash stock based compensation of million  partially offset by a credit in of million from astellas for manufacturing costs under the supply arrangement 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in primarily due to the ap phase spasticity program 
the timing and amount of research and development expenses incurred will primarily depend upon the extent of current or future clinical trials for ap  as well as the related expenses associated with our development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical program and product candidate manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consisted principally of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  information technology  legal  sales  marketing and human resources functions

the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was principally due to decreased personnel costs of million primarily due to decreased headcount 
we expect moderate increases in selling  general and administrative expenses compared to levels 
pursuant to our amended and restated collaboration agreement with gsk  we have up to three years to deploy a sales force following the april approval of horizant in the united states 
the timing and amount of selling  general and administrative expenses incurred will primarily depend upon if or when we deploy such sales force in support of the commercialization of horizant for rls 
restructuring charges as a result of the implementation of our march restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction in force of employees  or approximately of our workforce at the time  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the year ended december  the restructuring charges consisted primarily of million of leave of absence pay  severance and healthcare benefits  million of non cash stock based compensation and million of property and equipment write offs 
as of december   we had made all cash payments in association with this restructuring plan 
in december  as part of our ongoing evaluation of our facilities requirements in light of future plans  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of in connection with the permanent cease use of the office space in a building at central expressway  santa clara  california 
the restructuring charges consisted of million of facility related charges and million of property and equipment write offs 
as of december   we expect to make all cash payments associated with this action by august  which coincides with the end of the lease term for the office space 
interest and other income and interest and other expense year ended december  to change to change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income interest and other expense the decrease in interest and other income in compared to resulted primarily from awards that totaled million received and recognized in through the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program under section d of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which was enacted as part of the patient protection and affordable care act of  and  to a lesser extent  earnings on cash equivalents and short term investments 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates 
income taxes we recorded  and million of current income tax benefit for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the year ended december   million of current income tax benefit recognized was due to the adoption of a provision in the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of that allows businesses with net operating losses in or to carry back those losses for up to five years and million of current income tax benefit recognized was due to the adoption of a provision in the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of that allows corporations to convert carry forward research and development and alternative minimum tax credits into a refundable credit amount  which we claimed and received as a refund in cash in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above due to our significant research and development expenditures  we have generated cumulative operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations primarily through sales of our equity securities  non equity payments from our collaborators and interest earned on investments 
at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including corporate debt securities  investments backed by us government sponsored agencies and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation  and we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities in primarily reflected our net loss  partially offset by non cash stock based compensation 
the net cash used in operating activities in and primarily reflected our net loss and  to a lesser extent  changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by non cash stock based compensation 
additionally  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  which included approximately and million of cash expenditures  all of which was paid in the year ended december  net cash provided by used in investing activities primarily reflected the timing of purchases of investments and proceeds from maturities of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities in  and primarily reflected the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options 
we believe that our existing capital resources and anticipated milestone payments  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the third quarter of this estimate assumes receipt of a potential million milestone payment from gsk associated with the possible approval of horizant for the management of phn  assuming such approval occurs and the collaboration agreement with gsk is effective at the time of such approval 
we have based our estimate of cash sufficiency on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect 
further  our operating plan may change  and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization sooner than planned 
we have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than potential milestones and contingent payments receivable under our collaborations 
if our collaboration with gsk is terminated  we may not be entitled to any further milestone payments or royalties from gsk with respect to the development and commercialization of horizant  which could accelerate our need for additional capital 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our marketed product and product candidates  and the extent to which we enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including 
table of contents the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our preclinical testing  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the timing and amount of our share of operating losses from our gsk collaboration  the timing  receipt and amount of sales  profit sharing or royalties  if any  from horizant  regnite and our other potential products  the timing of any milestone and contingent payments under our collaborative arrangements  the costs and expenses associated with the litigation proceedings related to the xenoport complaint  the gsk complaint and the notice of termination of the collaboration agreement with gsk  if our collaboration with gsk is not terminated  the timing and costs of our establishment of a sales force to support our co promotion of horizant for the treatment of rls  if we establish a sales force  if our collaboration with gsk is terminated and rights to horizant revert to us  the timing and costs of establishing third party arrangements to market and sell horizant if we choose or are unable to establish sufficient sales  marketing and distribution capabilities on our own  the cost of manufacturing clinical  and establishing commercial  supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  including rights related to horizant that we obtained pursuant to our amended and restated collaboration agreement with gsk or that we may obtain if the collaboration with gsk is terminated  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  if any  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish or modify  the cost and expenses associated with any potential litigation  including any further litigation arising from our collaboration agreement with gsk  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent of product development funding under our current collaborative arrangements  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that complement our business  although we have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are  or anticipate that we may be  unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may terminate or delay clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates  we may delay our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates or we may curtail significant drug development programs for our product candidates 
in addition  if our collaboration agreement with gsk does not terminate  at any time upon advance notice to gsk  we may exercise the right to revert to a net sales royalty based compensation structure and forego the right to co promote horizant in the united states 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through equity financings  dilution to our stockholders would result 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
our ability to raise additional funds and the terms upon which we are able to raise such funds may be adversely impacted by the uncertainty regarding our financial condition  the outcome of the litigation proceedings with gsk  including whether our collaboration with gsk will terminate and on what terms  and or current economic conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid investments deposited in highly rated financial institutions in the united states 
a portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because our investments are short term in duration  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we contract for the conduct of certain manufacturing activities with a contract manufacturer in europe 
we made payments in the aggregate amount of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  to this european contract manufacturer 
we are subject to exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in connection with agreements with this european contract manufacturer 
to date  the effect of the exposure to these fluctuations in foreign exchange rates has not been material  and we do not expect it to be material in the foreseeable future 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes
