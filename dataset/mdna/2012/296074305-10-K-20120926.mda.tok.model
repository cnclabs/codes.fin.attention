during the year ended june  the company incurred a loss on disposal of certain drew assets of approximately  during the year ended june  the company received an income tax benefit of approximately  goodwill impairment emi at march  management became concerned about emi s performance year to date as compared to our projected budget 
the projected budget included sales related to emi s new image management system  axis  as well as traditional legacy digital imaging systems 
a significant portion of the axis product target market represents institutions requiring large scale  multi instrument solutions  which has resulted in a much longer sales cycle than the company had originally envisioned 
while the feedback from initial and potential customers of the axis product has been positive  converting this interest into sales has not materialized to date at the levels the company had originally projected 
emi had also encountered unexpected lagging demand for its legacy digital imaging systems primarily due to institutions allocating a disproportionate level of their capital budgets toward purchasing optical coherence tomography oct devices 
it was anticipated that the emerging oct technology would erode legacy digital imaging product sales due to competition for budgetary resources  however  the level has been greater than originally expected and not reflected in the company s original projections 
oct and digital imaging technologies are complementary and it is not known whether or for how long the lower available capital budgets for digital imaging will continue 
these events will negatively affect the evaluation of the future operating results and cash flows of emi 
the company typically tests goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis at june  and at any other time events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
management determined that the events discussed above warranted performing an interim test of goodwill for possible impairment during the quarter ended march  the first step of the fasb asc impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting segment with its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
the fair value was determined based on the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows 
under the income approach  the company assumed  with respect to emi  a forecasted cash flow period of five years  long term annual growth rates of and a discount rate of 
based on the interim income approach analysis that was performed for emi it was determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill was in excess of its respective fair value 
as such  the company was required to perform the second step analysis in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
the second step analysis consisted of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill  with an impairment charge resulting from any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on the second step analysis  the company concluded that all  of the goodwill recorded at emi was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge to continuing operations totaling  during the year ended june  the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on short term and long term projections of the company 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting segment  including profit margins  long term forecasts  discount rates and terminal growth rates  reflect the company s best estimates 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents overall liquidity and capital resources as of june  and table amounts are in thousands

table of contents from discontinued operations 
any necessary capital expenditures have generally been funded out of cash from operations  and the company is not aware of any factors that would cause historical capital expenditure levels to not be indicative of capital expenditures in the future and  accordingly  does not believe that the company will have to commit material resources to capital investment for the foreseeable future 
cash flows provided by financing activities in the amount of  during relate to proceeds from a related party note payable of  and offset by the repayment of debt of  cash flows used in financing activities for were approximately  related to repayment of debt 
the company continues to operate under an austerity plan to stem the recurring losses at drew see footnote of the statements to the consolidated financial statements for june  
if the company is unable to achieve improvement in this area in the near term  it is not likely that our existing cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund activities throughout the next to months without curtailing certain business activities 
the company s forecast of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
if the company raises funds in the future  the company may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements at prices and other terms that may not be as favorable as they would be absent such qualification 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all 
debt history on december   drew acquired certain assets of biocode for   euros plus acquisition costs of approximately  the sales price was payable in cash of approximately  approximately  euros and  in debt from drew 
the seller provided financing is collateralized by certain assets of biocode 
biocode assets were vertically integrated into the company s clinical diagnostics business that includes drew and jas 
on april  the company amended its seller financed debt in connection with the biocode transaction 
under the terms of the debt refinancing  the company agreed to pay the balance of the seller provided financing of  euros by the sum per month in euros having an exchange value of  united states dollars as of the date of payment 
interest remained unchanged and will accrue on the outstanding amount of the purchase price at an interest rate of per year on the basis of the actual days elapsed and a day year 
the first payment under the amended agreement was paid on may  upon the th month after this amendment  the company agreed to pay the balance of the outstanding amount in euros in full in one payment 
at the time of the refinancing  the current portion of our long term debt was reduced from approximately  to  on january  bh holdings  sas bhh a wholly owned subsidiary of drew  initiated the filing of an insolvency declaration with the tribunal de commerce de rennes  france commercial court 
the commercial court on january  opened the liquidation proceedings with continuation of bhh s activity for three months and named an administrator to manage bhh 
because bhh is no longer controlled by drew it was deconsolidated in the december  quarterly consolidated financial statements and prior period amounts are presented as discontinued operations see footnote to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
this debt was guaranteed by escalon  and as a result of the insolvency declaration the debt has been transferred to escalon 
on may   the holder of debt incurred by the company in connection with its acquisition of bhh informed the company that it intends to declare the entire amount in default  seek a judgment from a french court and then enforce the company s guarantee for payment 
consequently the company has recorded the entire debt of  as a current liability 
the company will not be able to pay the debt in its current form from existing resources 
the company will need to explore all potential options including raising additional funds or selling certain assets in order to pay the debt  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to successfully achieve these options 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon reaching a reasonable resolution with the debt holder or the ability to access funds to satisfy the debt obligation  as well as the other factors set forth under management s discussion and analysis debt history  continuing operations of this form k report 
forward looking statement about significant items likely to impact liquidity the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates 
table of contents the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the company has incurred recurring operating losses  debt payments and negative cash flows from operating activities 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  do not include any adjustments relating to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company s continuance as a going concern is dependent on the company s future profitability and on the on going support of the company s shareholders  affiliates and creditors 
in order to mitigate the going concern issues  the company is actively pursuing business partnerships  managing the company s continuing operations  selling certain assets and seeking capital funding on an ongoing basis via the issuance of securities and private placements 
if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to raise additional capital in the near term  the company may be required to significantly reduce its research  development  and administrative activities  including further reduction of its employee base 
in the normal course of business  the company engages in discussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as a result of any such transactions  the company s financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and alliances may require the company to integrate a different company culture  management team  business infrastructure  accounting systems and financial reporting systems 
the company may not be able to effect any such acquisitions or alliances 
the company may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired business in a way that enhances the performance of the company s combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from any expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  the company s successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including the retention of key employees and the management of facilities and employees in separate geographical areas 
these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert the company s attention from other business operations 
common stock the company s common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq capital market 
in order to continue to be listed on the nasdaq capital market  the following requirements must be met shareholders equity of  or market value of listed securities of  or net income from continuing operations in the latest fiscal year or two of the last three fiscal years of   publicly held shares   market value of publicly held shares  a minimum bid price of  round lot shareholders  two market makers  and compliance with corporate governance standards 
as of june   the company was not in compliance with these continued listing requirements 
on february   the company received a letter from the listing qualifications staff of the nasdaq stock market the staff notifying the company that it did not comply with the minimum  stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market as set forth in listing rule b 
the company submitted a plan to regain compliance within the calendar days from february  as required by nasdaq rules 
the staff accepted the company s plan to regain compliance and granted the company until august  to successfully implement it 
the company was unable to successfully implement its compliance plan by the august  deadline 
the company has scheduled a hearing before the staff to explain its plan for regaining compliance with the listing requirements 
the hearing is scheduled for october  in addition  on june   the company received a letter from the listing qualifications staff indicating that the company is not in compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement under the nasdaq listing rules the listing rules 
the listing rules require listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of per share 
if a nasdaq listed company trades below the minimum bid price requirement for consecutive business days  it is notified of the deficiency 
based upon the staff s review  the company no longer meets this requirement 
the listing rules provide the company with a compliance period of calendar days  or until december  in which to regain compliance with this requirement 
to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  the company must have a closing bid price of per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this compliance period 
in the event that the 
table of contents company does not regain compliance within this period  it may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance by satisfying certain requirements 
however  if it appears to the staff that the company will not be able to cure the deficiency  or if the company is otherwise not eligible  the staff will notify the company that its securities will be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
the company may still appeal the staff s determination to delist its securities to a hearing panel 
during any appeal process  the company s common stock would continue to trade on the nasdaq capital market 
the nasdaq notification letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the company s common stock on the nasdaq capital market 
the company is currently looking at all of the options available with respect to regaining such compliance 
if the company s nasdaq listing is terminated the company will be traded on the otc bulletin board 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact amounts reported therein 
the most significant of those involve the application of fasb issued authoritative guidance concerning revenue recognition  goodwill and other intangible assets  discussed further in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and  as such  include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management 
for example  estimates are used in determining valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  uncollectible receivables  obsolete inventory  sales returns and rebates warranty liabilities and purchased intangible assets 
actual results achieved in the future could differ from current estimates 
the company used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and  where applicable  established valuation techniques in making its estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of shipment  when title and risk of loss transfer 
the company provides products to its distributors at agreed wholesale prices and to the balance of its customers at set retail prices 
distributors can receive discounts for accepting high volume shipments 
the discounts are reflected immediately in the net invoice price  which is the basis for revenue recognition 
no further material discounts are given 
the company s considerations for recognizing revenue upon shipment of product to a distributor are based on the following persuasive evidence that an arrangement purchase order and sales invoice exists between a willing buyer distributor and the company that outlines the terms of the sale company information  quantity of goods  purchase price and payment terms 
the buyer distributor does not have a right of return 
shipping terms are ex factory shipping point 
at this point the buyer distributor takes title to the goods and is responsible for all risks and rewards of ownership  including insuring the goods as necessary 
the company s price to the buyer distributor is fixed and determinable as specifically outlined on the sales invoice 
the sales arrangement does not have customer cancellation or termination clauses 
the buyer distributor places a purchase order with the company  the terms of the sale are cash  cod or credit 
customer credit is determined based on the company s policies and procedures related to the buyer s distributor s creditworthiness 
based on this determination  the company believes that collectability is reasonably assured 
the company assesses collectability based on creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of the company s international customers  the company requires an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
valuation of intangible assets the company annually evaluates for impairment its intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  see footnote to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for details on a goodwill impairment charge related to the carrying amount of emi s goodwill 
these intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and trade names 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future discounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value 
the company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
the company 
table of contents performs its intangible asset impairment tests on or about june  of each year 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
income loss per share the company computes net income loss per share under the provisions of fasb issued authoritative guidance 
under the provisions of fasb issued authoritative guidance  basic and diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
the calculation of diluted net income loss per share excludes potential common shares if the impact is anti dilutive 
basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share are determined in the same manner as basic earnings per share  except that the number of shares is increased by assuming exercise of dilutive stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method 
taxes estimates of taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions are used in the tax rate calculation 
management uses judgment in estimating what the company s income will be for the year 
since judgment is involved  there is a risk that the tax rate may significantly increase or decrease in any period 
in determining income loss for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
fasb issued authoritative guidance concerning accounting for income taxes also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence  it is more likely that not that all or some portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating the company s ability to recover the company s deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence including the company s past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses and near term forecasts of future taxable income that is consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to manage the underlying businesses 
through june   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against the company s net operating losses for substantially all of the deferred tax asset due to uncertainty of their realization as a result of the company s earnings history  the number of years the company s net operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences and near term earnings expectations 
the amount of the valuation allowance could decrease if facts and circumstances change that materially increase taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
any reduction would reduce increase the income tax expense benefit in the period such determination is made by the company 
the company has adopted fasb issued guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  and disclosure in financial statements of uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
under the fasb guidance a company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
otherwise  no benefit can be recognized 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws 
the company has elected to recognize interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of its provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after july  is based on the grant date fair value estimate in accordance with the provisions of the fasb issued guidance 
the company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
valuations are based on highly subjective assumptions about the future  including stock price volatility and exercise patterns 
the fair value of share based payment awards was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury 
table of contents yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
recently issued accounting standards in january  fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update provides amendments to subtopic that requires new disclosure to include transfers in and out of levels and and activity in level fair value measurements 
further  this update clarifies existing disclosures on level of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
those disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements in april  the fasb issued asu  compensation stock compensation topic effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades  or asu asu provides amendments to topic to clarify that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity 
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
which provides a consistent definition of fair value in gaap and international financial reporting standards and ensures that their respective fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are the same except for minor differences in wording and style 
the amendments change certain fair value measurement principles and enhance the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
the standard will become effective for the company during interim and annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
the company does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
which requires an entity to present all non owner changes in stockholders equity either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this standard will become effective for the company in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 
the company does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
under that option  an entity no longer would be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments will be effective for the company for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
the company does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operation and cash flows
