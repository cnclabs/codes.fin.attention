we intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant items subject to such estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserve  sales returns liability  the useful life of property and equipment  the useful life of intangible assets  purchase accounting  the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the fair value of the retained interest in hzo  stock based compensation  deferred tax assets  and income tax uncertainties and other contingencies 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably may have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is derived from sales of its products through its indirect channel including retailers and distributors  its direct channels including www 
zagg 
com and www 
ifrogz 
com  its corporate owned and third party owned mall kiosks  from the license fees for the sale of exclusive independent distributor licenses related to the kiosk program  and for royalties earned on products licensed to third parties 
for product sales  the company records revenue  net of estimated returns and discounts  when delivery has occurred and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is reasonable assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
shipping and other transportation costs charged to buyers are recorded in both sales and cost of sales 
sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues 
for kiosk license fees  the company recognizes revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the license which is generally three years 
royalties are recognized in the period in which they are earned 
promotional products given to customers or potential customers are recognized as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales incentives provided to customers are recognized as a reduction of the related sale price at the time of sale  and  therefore  are a reduction in revenues 
reserve for sales returns and warranty liability for product sales  the company records revenue  net of estimated returns and discounts  when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
our return policy generally allows its end users and retailers to return purchased products 
in addition  the company generally provides the ultimate consumer a warranty with each product 
due to the nature of the invisibleshield product line  returns are generally not salvageable and are not included in inventory 
we estimate a reserve for sales returns and warranty and record the estimated reserve amount as a reduction of sales and as a sales return reserve liability 
when product is returned and is expected to be resold  as is the case with returns of ifrogz products  the reserve is recorded as a reduction of revenues and cost of sales  and as a sales return reserve liability 
the estimate for sales returns and warranty requires management to make significant estimates regarding return rates for sales and warranty returns 
historical experience  actual claims  and customer return rights are the key factors used in determining the estimated sales return and warranty reserve 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and judgments as to expected collectability of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
valuation of note receivable we engaged independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of collateral of the note receivable 
such valuations require significant estimates and assumptions 
management determined the value of the shares of zagg common stock held by mr 
harmer see note  notes receivable  in the notes to consolidated financial statements based on quoted market prices 
the real estate holdings were valued primarily based on the sales comparison approach as sales of comparable properties were utilized 
the investments in real estate companies  and private company stock and warrants were valued utilizing comparable market sales  a discounted cash flow analysis  and other appropriate valuation methodologies including the use of the black scholes option pricing model for the private company warrants 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
inventories in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and to compare these with current inventory levels 
when the market value of inventory is less than the carrying value  the inventory cost is written down to the estimated net realizable value thereby establishing a new cost basis 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
the company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
the determination of the realization of certain income tax positions is subject to significant estimates based upon the facts and circumstances of each position 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles  indefinite lived intangibles  and goodwill 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our acquisition of ifrogz and purchase of the hzo technology 
at least annually and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation  we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on discounted cash flows and market approach analyses as considered necessary  and consider factors such as a weakened economy  reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with a decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period as indicators for potential goodwill impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or  more frequently upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
the company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the indefinite lived intangible assets book value to its estimated fair value 
the fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets is determined by performing cash flow analysis and other market evaluations 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is less than book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
we also assess other long lived assets  specifically definite lived intangibles and property  plant and equipment  for potential impairment given similar impairment indicators 
when indicators of impairment exist related to our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  we use an estimate of the undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether the carrying amount of the assets is recoverable 
measurement of the amount of impairment  if any  is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including market and income approaches as considered necessary 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our goodwill and other long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
stock based compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements for awards granted to employees and non employees under its stock incentive plan  which include restricted stock  warrants  and stock options 
equity classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of stock options is measured on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model bsm  which involves the use of assumptions such as expected volatility  expected term  dividend rate  and risk free rate 
volatility is a key factor used to determine the fair value of stock options in the bsm 
depending on the expected term of the option  the company determines expected volatility based upon historical volatility 
for those options with an expected term that extends beyond the period in which sufficient historical data is unavailable  the company does not have sufficient historical data or implied volatility information to determine volatility based upon its own information 
therefore  the company uses significant judgment to identify a peer group and determine the appropriate weighting in order to estimate an implied volatility rate for use in the bsm 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill 
we engaged independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased classes of intangible assets recorded by us include customer relationships  trademarks  non compete agreements  developed technology  patents  and backlog 
the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets are discussed in note  acquisition of ifrogz in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows related to each individual asset  market position of the trademarks  as well as assumptions about cash flow savings from the trademarks  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change during the measurement period as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as discussed in note  acquisition of ifrogz in the notes to consolidated financial statements

commissions were also up on a comparison basis due to the strong sales of the zaggmate product online  continued growth through indirect accounts for which we utilize a third party sales company  and commissions incurred related to sales at the ifrogz segment 
depreciation and amortization increased significantly due to the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of ifrogz and the depreciation of ifrogz assets

other income expense for the year ended december   total other expense was  compared to other expense of for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in interests expense from debt entered into to acquire ifrogz  which was partially offset by the gain recognized on the deconsolidation of hzo

other income for the year ended december   total other expense was compared to other expense of for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased interest expense associated with our terminated credit facility and decreased interest income related to short term loans 
income taxes we recognized an income tax expense of  for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter ended december   we recorded a increase to income tax provision due to a return to provision adjustment

debt and letters of credit on june   and in conjunction with the acquisition of ifrogz  the company entered into a financing agreement the financing agreement led by cerberus business finance  llc cerberus and pnc bank national association pnc  which is acting as the administrative bank

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
to date we have not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge market risk in the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash in money market funds  which are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
we believe that the market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial  although there can be no guarantee that these market risks will be immaterial to us 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our financing facilities and capital structure 
market risk  calculated as the potential change in fair value of our cash equivalents and line of credit resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates  was not material at december
