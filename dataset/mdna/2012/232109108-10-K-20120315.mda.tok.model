we are a global medical device company specializing in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of laser and light based aesthetics systems for practitioners worldwide 
we offer easy to use products based on six platforms coolglide  xeo  solera  genesisplustm  excel vtm  and myqtm each of which enables physicians and other qualified practitioners to perform safe and effective aesthetic procedures for their customers 
commencing in the fourth quarter of  we launched a new q switched laser product called myq in japan  that cutera sources from a third party original equipment manufacturer oem 
the xeo and solera platforms offer multiple hand pieces and applications  which allow customers to upgrade their systems  which we treat as upgrade revenue 
in addition to systems and upgrade revenue  we generate revenue from the sale of post warranty service contracts  providing services for products that are out of warranty  titan hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceuticals 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in brisbane  california  from where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research and development  regulatory  sales and marketing  service  and administrative activities 
in the united states  we market  sell and service our products through direct sales and service employees  and a distribution relationship with pss world medical shared services  inc pss  a wholly owned subsidiary of pss world medical which has over sales representatives serving physician offices throughout the united states 
we also sell certain items such as our titan hand piece refills and marketing brochures online 

table of contents international sales are generally made through direct sales employees and a worldwide distributor network in over countries 
outside of the united states  we have a direct sales presence in australia  canada  france  japan  spain  switzerland however  beginning october  we engaged a distributor in switzerland instead of selling directly and the united kingdom 
products 
our revenue is derived from the sale of products  upgrades  service  titan hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceutical products 
product revenue represents the sale of a system 
a system consists of a console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface  a laser and or light based module  control system software and high voltage electronics  as well as one or more hand pieces 
however  depending on the application  the laser or light based module is sometimes contained in the hand piece such as with our pearl and pearl fractional applications instead of within the console 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched a new q switched laser system called myq 
we offer our customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost effectively add applications to their system as their practice grows 
this provides customers the flexibility to upgrade their systems whenever they want and provides us with a source of recurring revenue which we classify as upgrade revenue 
service revenue relates to amortization of prepaid service contracts  direct billings for detachable hand piece replacements and revenue for parts and labor on out of warranty products 
titan hand piece refill revenue is associated with our titan hand piece which requires replacement of the optical source after a set number of pulses have been used 
in japan  we distribute merz pharma gmbh s merz radiesse dermal filler product  and obagi medical products  inc s obagi cosmeceutical products 
significant business trends 
we believe that our ability to grow revenue will be primarily dependent on the following continuing to expand our product offerings both through internal development and sourcing from other vendors 
ongoing investment in our global sales and marketing infrastructure 
use of clinical results to support new aesthetic products and applications 
enhanced luminary development and reference selling efforts to develop a location where our products can be displayed and used to assist in selling efforts 
customer demand for our products 
consumer demand for the application of our products 
marketing to physicians in the core dermatology and plastic surgeon specialties  as well as outside those specialties 
generating ongoing revenue from our growing installed base of customers through the sale of service  upgrade  titan hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceutical products 
our us revenue increased by and our international revenue increased by in  compared to we believe the increase in us revenues was attributable to several factors  including fda clearance of our genesisplus system for onychomycosis  or toenail fungus  in april commencement of excel v shipments in the second quarter of effective us sales management changes implemented in early our total international revenue increased by in  compared to  and represented of our total revenue 
the international revenue growth was sourced primarily from australia  canada  japan  and several of our international distributor countries  partially offset by declines in europe 
in australia and canada  our revenue increased by and respectively in  compared to  primarily as a result of increased product sales 
with respect to japan  our revenue increased by  primarily as a result of continued growth from our dermal fillers and cosmecuticals business 
our gross margin remained flat at in  compared to  which was attributable to several factors  including an improvement of our margins for titan refill revenue  given did not have costs associated with the recall of certain titan xl hand pieces in  an increase of  of titan refill revenue  for which we traditionally earn a higher gross margin than our blended total gross margin percentage  
table of contents improved gross margin on our dermal fillers and cosmeceutical products sold in japan  due to higher average selling prices resulting from favorable foreign exchange rates  which was offset by lower gross margins for our product revenue  resulting from an unfavorable product mix towards lower margin products 
our gross margin in was  compared with in this decline was due to several factors  including the voluntary recall of certain titan xl hand pieces whereby eligible customers were provided with fully refilled hand pieces  a million  or  temporary decrease in our titan refill revenue in  compared to  for which we traditionally earn a higher gross margin than our blended total gross margin percentage  our asps declined in due primarily to customers purchasing fewer applications on their platforms and due to competitive discounting pressures  and a higher proportion of distributor revenue  that carries a lower gross margin  partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses resulting from headcount reductions  and reduced warranty and service expenses as a result of improved product reliability for products other than titan xl hand pieces 
our sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared with million in this increase was associated with higher personnel expenses and an increase in travel and entertainment expenses associated with the increase in revenue  which was partially offset by reduced promotional and marketing related spending 
as a percentage of net revenue  our sales and marketing expenses declined to  compared to in  due to the higher revenue in our research and development  or r d  expenses increased to million in  compared with million in this increase was associated with higher personnel expenses resulting primarily from higher headcount and consulting services in engineering relating to new product development programs

our industry is highly competitive and our future performance depends on our ability to compete successfully 
additionally  our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our product offerings with innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearances for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
if we fail to execute on the aforementioned initiatives  our business would be adversely affected 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future performance are provided in part i  item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows 
table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of products  upgrades  titan hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceuticals when title and risk of ownership has been transferred  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectability of those fees 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or collectability has not been reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue under service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
service revenue  not under a service contract  is recognized as the services are provided 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
fair value measurement of our long term auction rate securities investments we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars that represent investments in pools of student loan assets 
at the time of acquisition  these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
since february  uncertainties in the credit markets affected our ars investments and auctions for some of our ars have continued to fail to settle on their respective settlement dates while some have been redeemed in full at their respective par values 
the current portfolio of investments shown as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements represents those investments that are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the issuer refinances their debt 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to to at december   total financial assets measured and recognized at fair value were million and of these assets  million  or  were ars that were measured and recognized using significant unobservable inputs level 
during  million of ars were redeemed at their full par value  as a result we transferred from level assets million to cash and this resulted in a gain of  being recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in as of december   we had million par value million fair value of long term ars investments 
the aggregate loss in value is included as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
given observable market information was not available to determine the fair values of our ars portfolio  we valued these investments based on a discounted cash flow model 
while our ars valuation model was based on both level credit quality and interest rates and level inputs pricing models  we determined that the level inputs were the most significant to the overall fair value measurement  particularly the estimates of risk adjusted discount rates 
the expected future cash flows of the ars were discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate that compensated for the illiquidity 
projected future cash flows over the economic life of the ars of approximately years were modeled based on the contractual penalty rates for the security added to a tax adjusted libor interest rate curve 
the discount rates that were applied to the cash flows were based on a premium over the projected yield curve and included an adjustment for credit  illiquidity  and other risk factors 
see note summary of significant accounting policies fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statement in part ii  item of this form k for more information 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact the valuation include duration of time that the ars remain illiquid  changes to credit ratings of the securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  changes in the underlying collateral value  market discount rates for similar illiquid investments  and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the auctions for our ars investments continue to fail  and there is a further decline in their valuation  then we would have to i record additional reductions to the fair value of our ars investments  and ii record unrealized losses in our accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the losses in value that are associated with market risk 
if the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary then we would have to record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations for the loss in value associated with the worsening of the credit worthiness credit losses of the issuer  which would reduce future earnings and harm our business 
recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments we review for impairments on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of such as temporary or other than temporary 
factors that we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment  the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period  and our intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell  the investment before recovery 
beginning april   if an entity intends to sell  or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell  an impaired debt security prior to recovery of its cost basis  the security is other than temporarily impaired and the full amount of the impairment is required to be recognized as a loss through earnings 
otherwise  losses on securities which are other than temporarily impaired are separated into 
table of contents i the portion of loss which represents the credit loss  or ii the portion which is due to other factors 
the credit loss portion is recognized as a loss through earnings while the loss due to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes and related amortization 
at december   we had million of par value ars investments 
we intend to  and have the ability to  hold these investments until the anticipated date of maturity 
as such  we treat the decline in value as temporary and have recognized approximately  in unrealized losses 
given we believed that such losses were not credit related  we have included them in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
prior to april   all declines in fair value deemed to be other than temporary were reflected in earnings as realized losses 
with respect to the ars that we held as of april   we determined that the cumulative effect adjustment required to reclassify the non credit portion of previously recognized other than temporarily impaired adjustments was million 
therefore  we increased our accumulated earnings and decreased our accumulated other comprehensive income loss by the million cumulative effect adjustment 
stock based compensation expense employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
the expected volatility is a blend of implied and historical volatility 
we have determined that this is a more reflective measure of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility  than its limited historical volatility since the initial public offering of our common stock 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
as required under gaap  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
as of december   the unrecognized compensation cost  net of expected forfeitures  was million for stock options and stock awards and  for the employee stock purchase plan which will be recognized using the straight line attribution method over an estimated weighted average remaining amortization period of years and years  respectively 
see note stockholders equity  stock plans and stock based compensation expense  in the notes to consolidated financial statement in part ii  item of this form k for more information 
valuation of inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored and updated quarterly or as necessary  to reflect changes in raw material costs  labor to manufacture the product and overhead rates 
we provide for excess and obsolete inventories when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory provisions are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value and charged to cost of revenue to establish a lower cost basis for the inventories 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory provisions that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when product that had previously been written off is sold 
warranty obligations we provide a one year standard warranty on all systems 
warranty coverage provided is for labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale  and as reviewed and updated quarterly  of the total costs that we expect to incur in repairing or replacing product parts that fail while still under warranty 
accrued warranty costs include costs of material  technical support labor and associated overhead 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update based on historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future due to actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differing from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which would negatively impact our operating results 

table of contents provision for income taxes we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes on earnings 
we perform a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of tax exempt interest income  foreign operations  research and development tax credits  state taxes  certain benefits realized related to stock option activity  and changes in valuation allowance 
our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes  should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states 
the effective tax rate was approximately in  in  and in our future effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  or by changes in tax laws  accounting principles  interpretations thereof  net operating loss carryback  research and development tax credits  and due to changes in the valuation allowance of our us deferred tax assets 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been  or are intended to be  indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations 
if the total undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted  a significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the allowable foreign tax credits 
it is not practical for us to determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings 
our deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  which assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
the four sources of taxable income to be considered in determining whether a valuation allowance is required include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary requires an analysis of both positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
in general  positive evidence may include a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the deductible temporary differences  coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is the result of an aberration rather than a continuing condition  and an excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of our net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset 
in general  negative evidence may include a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  an expectation of being in a cumulative loss position in a future reporting period  
table of contents the existence of cumulative losses in recent years  and a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief that it would limit the realization of tax benefits 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified and judgment must be used in considering the relative impact of positive and negative evidence 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we considered available positive and negative evidence  giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carry back losses against prior taxable income and lesser weight to its projected financial results due to the challenges of forecasting future periods 
we also considered  commensurate with its objective verifiability  the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences 
at the end of the quarter ended september   changes in previously anticipated expectations and continued operating losses resulted in a valuation allowance against our tax benefits since we no longer considered them more likely than not realizable 
we also performed this evaluation as of the year ended december  and determined the full valuation allowance was still required 
long lived asset impairment long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not ultimately be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
through december   there have been no such impairments 
litigation we have been  and may in the future become  subject to legal proceedings related to securities litigation  intellectual property and other matters 
based on all available information at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable loss 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we record an estimated liability

table of contents revenue by product category our product revenue increased by in and by in  compared to the respective prior year periods 
the increase in product revenue was primarily attributable to the us fda clearance of the genesisplus system for toenail fungus in april and the commencement of excel v shipments in the second quarter of the increase in product revenue was primarily attributable to revenue from the genesisplus product that was launched in the third quarter of we believe that in and in some of our us current and prospective customers that did not have established medical offices  were reluctant to purchase capital equipment due to the general economic uncertainty and tight credit conditions  which contributed to the decline in our revenue in these years 
upgrade revenue decreased by in and by in  compared to the respective prior year periods 
prior to  we introduced new products that allowed existing customers to upgrade their previously purchased systems to obtain benefits from the additional capabilities  which drove our upgrade revenue

instead  we have launched new stand alone products genesisplus in and excel v in  which has resulted in a decline of our upgrade revenue since our service revenue increased by in compared to  and remained relatively flat in  compared to service contract amortization is the primary component of our service revenue 
the increase in was the result of higher international service revenue being partially offset by a decline in us service revenue 
the increase in international service revenue is due to an increased installed base and a higher number of customer purchased service contracts 
the decline in our us service revenue was primarily attributable to lower contract amortizations as a result of fewer customers purchasing extended service contracts  a decline in our service contract pricing  partially offset by higher revenue from the sale of detachable hand pieces other than titan refills 
in service revenue remained flat compared to as a result of the decline in unit sales in that included an element of deferred revenue for service contracts beyond our standard one year warranty term 
our titan hand piece refill revenue increased in  compared to  and decreased in  compared to the increase in was due primarily to the partial recovery of our titan refill revenue following the voluntary recall of our titan xl hand piece commencing in the second quarter of  in which we provided our eligible customers with a fully refilled titan xl hand piece  which delayed their purchase of a refill 
the decline in our titan refill revenue in  compared to  was also primarily attributable to the titan xl recall 
our dermal filler and cosmeceutical business increased by in  compared to  and by in compared to this increase was due primarily to the higher number of customers purchasing obagi products  which we began distributing in japan in the first quarter of  and due to the expansion of cosmeceutical product lines being distributed

asc requires the consideration of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we considered available positive and negative evidence  giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carry back losses against prior taxable income and lesser weight to our projected financial results due to the challenges of forecasting future periods 
we also considered  commensurate with its objective verifiability  the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences 
we performed this evaluation as of each of the years ended december   and under current tax laws  this valuation allowance will not limit our ability to utilize federal and state deferred tax assets provided we can generate sufficient future taxable income in the us

adequacy of cash resources to meet future needs we had cash  cash equivalents  marketable and long term investments of million as of december  of this amount  we had million invested in long term ars investments see critical accounting policies and estimates section above  for a full description of our long term investments in ars 
we believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we have certain contractual arrangements that create potential risk for us and are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
discussed below are off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  and minimum lease payments 
some of our leases have options to renew 

table of contents contractual obligations the following are our obligations for future minimum lease commitments related to facility leases as of december  payments due by period s contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components 
our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as agreed between the parties 
these forecasted time horizons can vary among different suppliers 
our open inventory purchase commitments were not material at december  as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
income tax liability we have included in our consolidated balance sheet  in long term income tax liability with respect to unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest as of december  at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
other in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements that contain a variety of representations  warranties  and indemnification obligations 
for example  we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers 
our exposure under the various indemnification obligations is unknown and not reasonably estimable as they involve future claims that may be made against us 
as such  we have not accrued any amounts for such obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and municipal bonds  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single type of investment or issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at a weighted average maturity interest reset date for ars of generally less than eighteen months 
based on duration modeling with respect to our total investmnet portfolio as of december   assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value would have potentially declined by approximately we hold interest bearing ars that represent investments in pools of student loans issued by the federal family education loan program 
at the time of acquisition  these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
since february  uncertainties in the credit markets affected our holdings in ars investments and auctions for all of our investments in these securities failed until december  in  and  approximately million   and million  respectively of our original million par value portfolio has been redeemed in full and as of december  we had million par value fair value of million of long term ars  whose auctions continue to fail 
these investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the ars is refinanced by the issuer into another type of debt instrument 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to we currently classify all of these investments as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet because of our continuing inability to determine when these investments will settle 
we have also modified our current investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments  united states treasury securities  municipal bonds  and eliminated investments in corporate debt 
the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include  duration of time that the ars remain illiquid  changes to credit ratings of the securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  changes in the underlying collateral value  market discount rates for similar illiquid investments  ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the auctions for our ars investments continue to fail  and there is a further decline in the valuation  then we would have to i record additional reductions to the fair value of our ars investments  and ii record unrealized losses in our accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the losses in value that are associated with market risk 
if the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary then we would have to record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations for the loss in value associated with the worsening of the credit worthiness credit losses of the issuer  which would reduce future earnings and harm our business 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk we have international subsidiaries and operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
although the majority of our revenue and purchases are denominated in us dollars  we have revenue to certain international customers and expenses denominated in the japanese yen  euro  pounds sterling  australian dollars  swiss francs and canadian dollars 
the net gains and losses from the revaluation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities was a gain of approximately  in  which is included in interest and other income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
movements in currency exchange rates could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or interest and other income expense 
though to date our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant  we cannot assure that there will not be a material impact in the future 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments
