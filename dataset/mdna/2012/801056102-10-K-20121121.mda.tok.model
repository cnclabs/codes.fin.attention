risk factors 
competition for our integrated manufacturing solutions business  we face competition from other major global ems companies such as benchmark electronics  inc  celestica  inc  flextronics international ltd  jabil circuits  inc and plexus corp 
our components  products and services business faces competition from ems and non ems companies that often have a regional product  service or industry specific focus 
in addition  our potential customers may also compare the benefits of outsourcing their manufacturing to us with the merits of manufacturing products themselves 
we compete with different companies depending on the type of solution or geographic area 
we believe the primary competitive factors in our industry include manufacturing technology  quality  delivery  responsiveness  provision of value added solutions and price 
we believe our primary competitive strengths include our ability to provide global end to end solutions  our product design and engineering resources  our advanced technologies  our vertically integrated manufacturing solutions  our high quality manufacturing assembly and test solutions  our customer focus and responsiveness  our expertise in serving diverse end markets  our robust it solution and our experienced management team 
intellectual property we hold various united states and foreign patents primarily related to printed circuit board technologies  methods of manufacturing printed circuit boards  enclosures  memory modules and enterprise computing servers and storage 
for other proprietary processes  we rely primarily on trade secret protection 
we also have registered trademarks in the united states and certain other countries 
a number of our patents covering certain aspects of our manufacturing processes or products have expired or will expire in the near future 
such expirations reduce our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use similar technology 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the united states  as well as foreign laws and regulations relating to the treatment  storage  use  discharge  emission and disposal of chemicals  solid waste and other hazardous materials used during our manufacturing processes 
we are also subject to occupational safety and health laws  product labeling and product content requirements  either directly or as required by our customers 
proper waste disposal is a major consideration in particular for printed circuit board manufacturers because of the metals and chemicals used in the manufacturing process 
water used in the printed circuit board manufacturing process must be treated to remove metal particles and other contaminants before it can be discharged into municipal sanitary sewer systems 
we operate on site 
table of contents wastewater treatment systems at our printed circuit board manufacturing plants in order to treat wastewater generated in the fabrication process 
in addition  although the electronics assembly process generates significantly less wastewater than printed circuit board fabrication  maintenance of environmental controls is also important in the electronics assembly process because such operations can generate lead dust 
upon vacating a facility  we are responsible for remediating the lead dust from the interior of the manufacturing facility 
although there are no applicable standards for lead dust remediation in manufacturing facilities  we endeavor to make efforts to remove the residues 
to date  lead dust remediation costs have not been material to our operations 
we also monitor for airborne concentrations of lead in our buildings and are not aware of any significant lead concentrations in excess of the applicable osha or other local standards 
we have a range of corporate programs in place with regard to environmental compliance and reduction of the use of hazardous materials in manufacturing 
in the environmental compliance area  we have developed corporate wide standardized environmental management systems  auditing programs and policies to enable us to better manage environmental compliance activities 
our facilities are also certified under iso  a set of standards and procedures relating to environmental compliance management 
in addition  the electronics industry is subject to the european union s restrictions of hazardous substances  or rohs  and waste electrical and electronic equipment  or weee  directives which took effect beginning in july parallel initiatives have been adopted in other jurisdictions  including several states in the united states and the peoples republic of china 
rohs limits the use of lead  mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and weee requires producers to assume responsibility for the collection  recycling and management of waste electronic products and components 
we have implemented procedures intended to make our manufacturing process compliant with rohs and the european union s registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach legislation  when required 
in the case of weee  the compliance responsibility rests primarily with oems rather than with ems companies 
asbestos containing materials  or acm  are present at several of our manufacturing facilities 
although the acm is being managed and controls have been put in place pursuant to acm operations and maintenance plans  the presence of acm could give rise to remediation obligations and other liabilities 
our plants generally operate under environmental permits issued by governmental authorities 
for the most part  these permits must be renewed periodically and are subject to revocation in the event of violations of environmental laws 
any such revocation could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  thereby having an adverse impact on our results of operations 
primarily as a result of certain of our acquisitions  we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination 
these liabilities include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites  including irvine  california  owego  new york  derry  new hampshire  fort lauderdale  florida  and brockville  ontario 
in addition  we have been named in a lawsuit alleging operations at our current and former facilities in orange county  california contributed to groundwater contamination 
there are some sites  including our acquired facility in gunzenhausen  germany  that are known to have groundwater contamination caused by a third party  and that third party has provided indemnity to us for the liability 
third party indemnities may not be effective to reduce our liability for environmental contamination 
for example  nortel networks  which had provided us an indemnity with respect to environmental investigation activities being undertaken at our former brockville site  is party to bankruptcy proceedings that may cause it not to fully honor its indemnification obligations to us 
the time required to perform environmental remediation can be lengthy and there can be no assurance that the scope of these activities will not increase as a result of the discovery of new contamination or contamination on adjoining landowner s properties or the adoption of more stringent regulatory standards covering sites at which we are currently performing remediation activities 
as a result there can be no assurance that these or any other similar third party or governmental claims that may be filed in the future will not result in material liability to us 
we have also been named as a potentially responsible party at a contaminated disposal site operated by another party at the casmalia resources disposal site in southern california as a result of the past disposal of hazardous waste by companies we have acquired or by our corporate predecessors 
in addition  we have been named as a potentially responsible party by the california department of toxic substance control at a waste treatment site operated by another party in san jose  california  allegedly as a result of waste we sent to be treated at that facility being discharged into the environment 
although liabilities for such historic disposal activities have not materially affected our financial condition to date  we cannot assure you that past disposal activities will not result in liability that will materially affect us in the future  nor can we provide assurance that we do not have environmental exposures of which we are unaware and which could adversely affect our operating results 
we use environmental consultants primarily for risk assessments and remediation  including remedial investigation and feasibility studies  remedial action planning and design  and site remediation 
these consultants provide information to us 
table of contents regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  acceptable remediation alternatives  and estimated costs associated with each remediation alternative 
this information is considered by us  together with other information  when determining the appropriate amount to accrue for environmental liabilities 
employees as of september   we had  employees  including  temporary employees 
none of our us employees are represented by a labor union 
in some international locations  our employees are represented by labor unions on either a national or plant level or are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
some foreign countries also have mandatory legal provisions regarding terms of employment  severance compensation and other conditions of employment that are more restrictive than us laws 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good

table of contents item a 
risk factors adverse market conditions in the electronics industry could reduce our future sales and earnings per share 
we cannot accurately predict future levels of demand for our customers electronics products 
consequently  our past operating results  earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results  earnings and cash flows 
beginning in the fourth quarter of calendar and continuing through  adverse worldwide economic conditions led to challenging conditions in the electronics industry 
a number of factors  including price instability  the availability and cost of credit  high global unemployment and concerns about the stability and solvency of financial institutions  financial markets  businesses  and sovereign nations have slowed global economic growth in many countries 
these conditions resulted in our customers delaying purchases or placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously experienced or anticipated 
such conditions could also cause a reduction in orders from our customers or potential customers due to a reduced availability of credit and the insolvency of one or more customers or suppliers 
any of these factors could reduce our revenues  increase our costs and decrease our liquidity 
we may experience component shortages or price increases  which could cause us to delay shipments to customers and reduce our sales and net income 
we are dependent on certain suppliers  including limited and sole source suppliers  to provide key components we incorporate into our products 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  delays in delivery and shortages of components  which in turn could cause delays in product shipments to customers  result in reduced revenue from and have an adverse effect on our relationship with affected customers  and our reputation generally as a reliable service provider 
component shortages can result in increased component prices which would result in decreased gross profit 
component delays and shortages can also result from natural disasters occurring in the regions in which our suppliers operate  such as the march earthquake in japan and the widespread flooding in thailand during late we may purchase components in advance of our requirements for such components as a result of a threatened or anticipated shortage 
in this event  we may incur additional inventory carrying costs and have a heightened risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence  the cost of either of which may not be recoverable from our customers 
such costs would reduce our margins and net income 
finally  if key components become scarce  we may be required to look to second tier vendors or to procure components through brokers 
such components may be of lesser quality than those otherwise available and could cause us to incur costs to qualify such components or to replace them if they prove to be defective 
our customers could experience credit problems  which would reduce our future revenues and net income 
many of the industries for which we provide products have previously experienced significant financial difficulty  with some of the participants filing for bankruptcy 
such financial difficulty  if experienced by one or more of our customers  may negatively affect our business due to the decreased demand from these financially distressed customers  the lengthening of customer payment terms  the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us or to purchase inventory we acquired to support their businesses  or any of these factors 
customer bankruptcies also entail the risk of potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to us that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy laws 
we do not carry insurance against the risk of customer default on their payment obligations to us 
we seek to mitigate the impact of collection problems with our customers on our financial results by evaluating their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts that is assessed for adequacy quarterly 
however  should customer defaults increase substantially or exceed the level of our allowance  our revenue  net income and cash position would be reduced  perhaps significantly 
our cash generated from operations is variable  which can adversely affect our ability to plan and invest in the business 
our ability to make capital expenditures and pay down debt and the extent to which we need to utilize our borrowing facilities depends in large part on our ability to generate cash from operations 
cash generated from operations is highly variable 
for example  during  we used million of cash in operating activities  in we generated million in cash from operating activities and in  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
our cash generated by or used in operations is impacted by a number of variables  including our growth and profitability  customer and supplier payment terms  timeliness of customer payments to us and the extent to which we need to increase inventories in response to customer forecasts 
to the extent our cash from operations fluctuates significantly in the future  our ability to make investments in our business and reduce our debt could be adversely impacted 

table of contents our strategy to pursue higher margin business depends in part on the success of our components  products and services cps business  which  if not successful  could cause our future gross margins and operating results to be lower 
a key part of our strategy is to grow our cps business  which includes printed circuit boards  backplane and cable assemblies  mechanical systems  memory  defense and aerospace and enterprise computing products  and design  engineering  logistics and repair services 
a decrease in orders for these products and services can have a disproportionate adverse impact on our profitability since these products and services generally carry higher than average contribution margins 
in order to grow this portion of our business profitability  we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our product development capabilities  research and development activities  test and tooling equipment and skilled personnel 
the success of our cps business also depends on both our ability to increase sales of our propriety products  cause our customers to agree to purchase our components for use in the manufacture of their products and expand the number of our customers who contract for our design  engineering  logistics and repair services 
we may face challenges in achieving commercially viable yields and difficulties in manufacturing components in the quantities and to the specifications and quality standards demanded by our customers  as well as in qualifying our components for use in our customers designs 
our proprietary products and design  engineering  logistics and repair services must compete with products and services offered by established vendors which focus solely on development of similar technologies or the provision of similar services 
any of these factors could cause our cps revenue and margins to be less than expected  which would have an overall adverse and potentially disproportionate effect on our revenues and profitability 
adverse changes in the key end markets we target could harm our business by reducing our sales 
we provide products and services to companies that serve the communications  industrial  defense  medical  enterprise computing and storage  multimedia  clean technology and automotive industries 
adverse changes in any of these markets could reduce demand for our customers products or make these customers more sensitive to the cost of our products and services  either of which could reduce our sales  gross margins and net income 
a number of factors could affect any of these industries in general  or our customers in particular  and lead to reductions in net sales  thus harming our business 
these factors include short product life cycles of our customers products leading to continuing new requirements and specifications and product obsolescence  either of which could cause us to lose business  failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance which could decrease the volume of orders customers place with us  and recessionary periods in our customers markets which decrease orders from affected customers 
we realize a substantial portion of our revenues from communications equipment customers 
this market is highly competitive  particularly in the area of price 
should any of our larger customers in this market fail to effectively compete with their competitors  they could reduce their orders to us or experience liquidity difficulties  either of which would have the effect of reducing our revenue and net income  perhaps substantially 
in addition  in the case of our defense business  future us government budget conditions and the scheduled withdrawal of armed forces from afghanistan could result in a decrease in defense spending  which in turn could cause a reduction in orders placed by the government or defense contractors for products manufactured by our defense and aerospace das division 
since such products carry higher margins than many of our other products and services  such a decrease would contribute disproportionately to a reduction in our gross margin and profitability 
for example  an unexpected decline in das orders during the second quarter of contributed to our financial results not meeting analyst expectations in that quarter 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience declines in demand for such products in the future 
we may be unable to generate sufficient liquidity to reduce our debt levels or maintain or expand our operations  which may cause our stock price to fall and reduce the business our customers and vendors do with us 
our liquidity is dependent on profitability and business volume which affects working capital  including inventory requirements  the extension of trade credit by our suppliers  the degree of alignment of payment terms from our suppliers to payment terms granted to our customers  investments in facilities and equipment  acquisitions  repayments of obligations under outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of our outstanding debt 
in order to improve our liquidity  during the second quarter of  we renewed and increased our asset backed credit facility increasing the facility to million  under which we could borrow million based on the levels of eligible receivables and inventories as of september   and in the fourth quarter of  we borrowed million secured by our corporate headquarters 
we also have million in short term financing facilities of which million remained available to be borrowed as of september  our asset backed credit facility expires as early as the second quarter of should the senior floating rate notes due not be repaid  redeemed  defeased  refinanced or reserved under the borrowing base  and as late as march our next long term debt 
table of contents maturity is in additionally  million of our foreign short term credit facilities expires in the third quarter of and million expires in the fourth quarter of on july   we redeemed million of notes due in using cash  borrowings under our credit facilities and the net proceeds from our million loan 
in the event we need additional capital  whether for working capital  debt repayment or otherwise  there can be no assurance that such additional debt or equity capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
new financing could result in us issuing additional equity securities  which could cause dilution to existing stockholders 
if additional or continued financing  including the continued extension of trade credit by our suppliers  is not available when required  our liquidity would be reduced 
the risks of reduced liquidity include an inability to maintain or increase our rates of production  to make necessary capital expenditures in order to maintain and expand our manufacturing capacity as needed  and to repay  reduce or refinance our debt 
any of these issues could cause our stock price to fall and reduce our customers and vendors willingness to do business with us 
our credit arrangements contain covenants which may adversely impact our business and the failure to comply with such covenants could cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable 
other than our million loan which used certain of our real property as collateral  our debt agreements do not contain financial covenants currently applicable to us  but do include a number of restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  making investments and other restricted payments  selling assets  paying dividends and redeeming or repurchasing capital stock and debt  subject to certain exceptions 
our million loan requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio during its term 
these covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisition or engage in other transactions which the covenants would otherwise restrict  including refinancing our existing debt 
in addition  such agreements include covenants requiring  among other things  that we file quarterly and annual financial statements with the sec  comply with all laws  pay all taxes and maintain casualty insurance 
if we are not able to comply with all of these covenants  for any reason  some or all of our outstanding debt as well as all amounts payable under our interest rate swaps on such debt  if any  could become immediately due and payable and the incurrence of additional debt under our asset backed credit facility would not be allowed  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business 
early redemptions and repurchases of debt reduce our working capital and liquidity  debt refinancing can entail higher interest expense  which would lower our net income  interest payments on variable rate debt can increase  which would lower our net income 
during  and  we redeemed million  net million and net million of our long term debt  respectively 
although redemptions and repurchases of debt improve our operating results by reducing our interest expense  these actions also reduce our liquidity 
if we should repurchase or redeem additional debt or equity  our working capital and liquidity would be further reduced 
in addition  should we undertake to refinance any of our outstanding long term debt  the next maturity of which is  there can be no assurance that the terms of such refinancing  particularly the interest rate  would be favorable to us 
should we be forced to replace lower interest rate debt with higher interest rate debt  our net income would be reduced 
as of september   an aggregate of million of our long term debt and all of our short term borrowings bear interest at a variable rate based upon libor 
interest rates  including libor  can change due to a variety of factors  including governmental debt levels  ratings downgrade of us or other sovereign debt  the pace of economic growth and central bank actions 
in addition  volatility of libor could increase following recent governmental investigations concerning the manner in which libor rates are determined 
should libor increase substantially in the future for any reason  interest payments on our variable interest rate debt would also increase  lowering our net income 
we are subject to intense competition in the ems industry which could cause us to lose sales and therefore hurt our financial performance 
the ems industry is highly competitive and the industry has been experiencing a surplus of manufacturing capacity  particularly in light of the slowdowns in the us and certain international economies 
our competitors include major global electronics manufacturing services ems providers such as benchmark electronics  inc  celestica  inc  flextronics international ltd  jabil circuit  inc and plexus corp  as well as other ems companies that have a regional  product  service or industry specific focus 
some of those companies have greater manufacturing and financial resources than we do 
we also face competition from current and potential oem customers who may elect to manufacture their own products internally rather than outsourcing to ems providers 
we may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors because those competitors may have lower operating costs as a result of their geographic location  greater economies of scale or the services they provide or because these 
table of contents competitors are willing to provide ems services at prices we are unable or unwilling to offer 
there can be no assurance that we will not lose business in the future in response to such competitive pricing or other inducements which may be offered by our competitors  which would decrease our sales and net income 
if demand for our higher end  higher margin manufacturing services does not increase  our future gross margins and operating results may be lower than expected 
we typically earn lower gross margins when we provide less complex ims services 
we experience continued pressure from oems to reduce prices  and competition remains intense 
pricing pressure is typically more intense for less complex  lower margin ims services 
this price competition has affected  and could continue to adversely affect  our gross margins 
if demand for our higher end  higher margin manufacturing services and products does not increase in the future  our gross margins and operating results in future periods may be lower than expected 
our operating results are subject to significant uncertainties  which make predictability of our future sales and net income difficult 
our operating results are subject to significant uncertainties  including conditions in the economy as a whole and in the electronics industry  fluctuations in components prices and component shortages caused by high demand  natural disaster or otherwise  timing of new product development by our customers which creates demand for our services  levels of demand in the end markets served by our customers  our ability to replace declining sales from end of life programs with new business wins  timing of orders from customers and the accuracy of their forecasts  inventory levels of customers  which if high relative to their normal sales volume  could cause them to reduce their orders to us  timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor  increased labor costs in the regions in which we operate  mix of products ordered by and shipped to major customers  as high volume and low complexity manufacturing services typically have lower gross margins than more complex and lower volume services  degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity  our ability to maintain desired plant operating efficiencies  including achieving acceptable yields  effectively planning production and managing our inventory and fixed assets to avoid high carrying costs and excess working capital  customer insolvencies resulting in bad debt or inventory exposures that are in excess of our reserves  our ability to efficiently move manufacturing activities to lower cost regions without adversely affecting customer relationships while controlling costs related to the closure of facilities and employee severance  pricing and other competitive pressures  fluctuations in the values of our assets  including real property and assets held for sale  which could result in charges to income  volatility of foreign currency exchange rates  changes in our tax provision due to changes in our estimates of pre tax income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  including our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  and political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations which could restrict our operations or increase our costs 
if any of these uncertainties should be realized  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
a portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders  which are difficult to predict 
if we do not receive anticipated orders as expected  our profitability will decline 
moreover  our ability to reduce our costs as a result of current or future restructuring efforts may be limited because consolidation of operations can be a costly and lengthy process to complete 
we generally do not obtain long term volume purchase commitments from customers and  therefore  cancellations  reductions in production quantities  delays in production by our customers and changes in customer requirements could reduce our sales and net income 

table of contents we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers and our bookings may generally be canceled prior to the scheduled shipment date 
customers may cancel their orders  reduce production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons  including significant decreases in demand for their products and services 
although the customer is generally liable for finished goods and work in process at the time of cancellation  we may be unable or  for other business reasons  choose not to enforce our contractual rights 
cancellations  reductions or delays of orders by customers would reduce our sales and net income by decreasing the volumes of products that we manufacture for our customers  delay or eliminate recovery of our expenditures for inventory purchased in preparation for customer orders  and lower our asset utilization  which would result in lower gross margins and lower net income 
in addition  customers sometimes require that we transfer the manufacturing of their products from one facility to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives 
these transfers have resulted in increased costs to us due to facility downtime or less than optimal utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
these transfers also have required us to close or reduce operations at certain facilities  particularly those in high cost locations such as the united states  canada and western europe  and as a result we have incurred significant costs for the closure of facilities  employee severance and related matters 
we also have encountered occasional delays and complications related to the transition of manufacturing programs to new locations 
we may be required to relocate our manufacturing operations in the future and  accordingly  we may incur additional costs that decrease our net income 
commodity price fluctuations may negatively impact our results of operations 
our components are manufactured using a number of commodities  including petroleum  gold  copper and other metals that are subject to frequent and unpredictable changes in price due to worldwide demand  investor interest and economic conditions 
we do not hedge against the risk of these fluctuations  but rather attempt to adjust our product pricing to reflect such changes 
portions of the dodd frank act  which will require due diligence and disclosure by publicly traded oem s and manufacturers of information concerning the source of certain minerals contained in their products  may reduce the acceptable sources of supply of such minerals  which could have the effect of increasing prices for such minerals and the components containing them 
should significant increases in commodities prices occur and should we not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs  our gross margins and profitability would decrease  perhaps significantly 
energy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations 
we  along with our suppliers and customers  rely on various energy sources including oil in our manufacturing and transportation activities 
there has been significant volatility in the prices of energy during the recent past and such volatility is likely to continue in the future 
a sustained increase in energy prices could cause an increase to our raw material  components and transportation costs 
we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs 
in addition  any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability 
we rely on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our sales  and declines in sales to these customers would reduce our net sales and net income 
one customer represented or more of our net sales and sales to our ten largest customers represented of our net sales during we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our sales 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by our large customers would adversely affect our operating results 
in the past  some of our large customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us as a result of changes in demand for their product  consolidations or divestitures or for other reasons 
in particular  certain of our customers have from time to time entered into manufacturing divestiture transactions with other ems companies  and such transactions could reduce our revenues with these customers 
we cannot assure you that present or future large customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us  any of which would reduce our net sales and net income 
we are subject to risks arising from our international operations 
we conduct our international operations primarily in asia  latin america  canada and europe  and we continue to consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities 
we generated of our net sales from non us operations in and a significant portion of our manufacturing material was provided by 
table of contents international suppliers during this period 
as a result of our international operations  we are affected by economic  political and other conditions in foreign countries  including the imposition of government controls  compliance with us and foreign laws concerning trade and employment practices  difficulties in obtaining or complying with export license requirements  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  labor unrest  including strikes  and difficulties in staffing  security concerns  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  coordinating communications among and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  currency controls  increases in duty and or income tax rates  adverse rulings in regards to tax audits  excess costs associated with reducing employment or shutting down facilities  misappropriation of intellectual property  and constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices 
our operations in certain foreign locations receive favorable income tax treatment in the form of tax holidays or other incentives 
in the event that such tax holidays or other incentives are not extended  are repealed  or we no longer qualify for such programs  our taxes may increase  which would reduce our net income 
additionally  a significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by  and therefore held in  foreign jurisdictions 
some jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the us or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash 
to the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in  or is needed by  our us operations  we may incur significant taxes to repatriate these funds 
we operate in countries that have experienced labor unrest and political instability  including china  india  malaysia  thailand and other countries in southeast asia and we have experienced work stoppages and similar disruptions in certain foreign jurisdictions  including india 
to the extent such developments prevent us from adequately staffing our plants and manufacturing and shipping products in those jurisdictions  our margins and net income could be reduced and our reputation as a reliable supplier could be negatively impacted 
failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages  which would reduce our net income 
we are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws  including those related to safety  wages and overtime  discrimination  whistle blowing  classification of employees and severance payments 
enforcement activity relating to these laws  particularly outside of the united states  can increase as a result of increased media attention due to violations by other companies  changes in law  political and other factors 
although we believe that our employment practices comport with local customs  there can be no assurance that  due to a more aggressive enforcement posture by governmental authorities  we won t be found to have violated elements of such laws  which can be complex  in the future 
any such violations could lead to the assessment of fines against us by federal  state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees  which could be substantial and would reduce our net income 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could increase our taxes and decrease our net income 
we are subject to income  sales  value added and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for taxes and  in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws and other factors 
our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our tax provisions  including through assessment of back taxes  interest and penalties 
for example  we are currently undergoing audits of our tax returns for certain recent tax years in a number of jurisdictions  including the us and mexico 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and our 
table of contents existing tax reserves are adequate  the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions which could lead to an increase in our taxes payable and a decrease in our net income 
we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future 
we have incurred significant expenses related to restructuring of our operations in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
for example  we have moved  and may continue to move  our operations from higher cost to lower cost locations to meet customer requirements 
we have incurred costs related to workforce reductions  facilities closure and subsequent environmental remediations  work stoppages and labor unrest resulting from the closure of our facilities in higher cost locations 
in addition  we have incurred unanticipated costs related to the transfer of operations to lower cost locations  including costs related to integrating new facilities  managing operations in dispersed locations and realigning our business processes 
we also have incurred costs to restructure operations that have been acquired in order to integrate them into our company 
we expect to be required to record additional charges related to restructuring activities in the future  but cannot predict the timing or amount of such charges 
any such charges would reduce our net income 
our results can be adversely affected by rising labor costs 
there is substantial uncertainty about future labor costs  in particular within the lower cost regions in which we operate 
in the past  labor disputes and strikes based partly on wages have slowed or stopped production at certain manufacturers in china and india 
in some cases  employers have responded by significantly increasing the wages of workers at such plants 
in addition  the cost structure in certain countries that are now considered to be favorable may increase as economies develop  causing local wages to rise 
in addition  demographic and other changes may cause a sustained and permanent increase in wages in the lower cost geographies in which we operate  particularly in china 
if we are required to make any substantial increase in wages that we are unable to recover from our customers  our profitability would be reduced 
as a result of our components ordering policies and customer requested ship dates  we may incur  and not be able to recover from our customers  the purchase price or carrying costs of components  work in process or finished goods kept in our inventory  which would decrease our margins and net income 
in order to satisfy customer orders  we are frequently required to order components and other parts in advance of customer payment  particularly for long lead time items 
furthermore  we may be required to keep additional components  work in process and finished goods in inventory in order to meet customer delivery dates 
while our supply agreements with our customers generally allocate most of the liability for payment for such items to the customers  we may nonetheless incur additional carrying costs or not ultimately be compensated for these items should the customer default upon its obligations 
to the extent we incur any such costs  our gross margins and net income would be reduced 
if we manufacture or design defective products  or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements  we could be subject to claims  damages and fines and lose customers 
we manufacture products to our customers specifications  and in some cases our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements 
for example  many of the medical devices that we manufacture  as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them must comply with standards established by the united states food and drug administration 
in addition  our customers products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex 
as a result  products that we design or manufacture may at times contain design or manufacturing defects  and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or may not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
defects in the products we design or manufacture may result in product recalls  warranty claims by customers  including liability for repair costs  delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders 
if these defects or deficiencies are significant  our results of operations and business reputation could be harmed 
the failure of the products that we design or manufacture or of our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and  in some cases  require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing program or facility 
in addition  these defects may result in product liability claims against us 
the magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical  automotive  and aerospace and defense manufacturing services because defects could result in death or significant injury to end users of these products 
even if our customers are contractually responsible for defects in the design of a product  we could nonetheless be named in a product liability suit over such defects and could be required to expend significant resources defending ourselves 

table of contents we design products on a contract basis or jointly with our customers 
the design services that we provide can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face when providing our regular manufacturing services 
for example  we have increased exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries caused by defects in products we design  as well as potential claims that products we design infringe third party intellectual property rights 
such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and  regardless of their merits  could be time consuming and expensive to resolve 
any such costs and damages could be significant and would reduce our net income 
our business could be adversely affected by any delays  or increased costs  resulting from the use of common carriers to transport our materials and  products 
we rely on a variety of common carriers to transport our raw materials and components from our suppliers to us  and to transport our products to our customers 
the use of common carriers is subject to a number of risks  including increased costs due to rising energy prices and labor  vehicle and insurance costs  criminal activity  such as hijackings  resulting in losses of shipments  delivery delays resulting from labor disturbances and strikes and other factors beyond our control 
while we attempt to mitigate our liability for any losses resulting from these risks through contracts with our customers  suppliers and insurance carriers  any costs or losses that cannot be mitigated could reduce our profitability  require us to manufacture replacement product or damage our relationships with our customers 
our key personnel are critical to the continued growth of our business and we cannot assure you that they will remain with us 
our success depends upon the continued service of our key personnel 
generally  these employees are not bound by employment or non competition agreements 
we cannot assure you that we will retain our key employees  particularly our highly skilled operations managers and engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and development of new products and processes 
the competition for these employees is intense 
in addition  if one or more of our key employees were to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us or otherwise become unavailable to us  we could lose customers and our sales and gross margins could decrease 
if we are unable to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise  our business could be adversely affected 
improvements to and refinements of our manufacturing processes are necessary to manufacture next generation products for our customers in a cost efficient manner 
as a result  we are continually evaluating the cost effectiveness and feasibility of new manufacturing processes 
in some cases  we will be required to make capital expenditures and incur engineering expense in order to qualify and validate any such new process 
such expenses would reduce our net income 
in addition  any delay in the deployment of such new process  or problems commencing volume production using a new process could also reduce our margins and net income and harm our reputation with our customers 
our international sales are subject to laws relating to trade  export controls and foreign corrupt practices  the violation of which could adversely affect our operations 
we are required to comply with all applicable domestic and foreign export control laws  including the international traffic in arms regulations itar and the export administration regulations ear 
some items manufactured by us are controlled for export by the united states department of commerce s bureau of industry and security under the ear 
in addition  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and international counterparts relating to bribery of foreign governments and officials 
violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions  including large monetary penalties and suspension or debarment from participation in future business opportunities  which could reduce our future revenue and net income and damage our reputation as a reputable supplier 
we are subject to a number of us governmental procurement rules and regulations  the failure to comply with which could result in damages or reduction of future revenue 
we are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts and subcontracts 
such laws and regulations govern  among other things  price negotiations  cost accounting standards and other aspects of performance under government contracts 
these rules are complex and our performance under them is subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency and other government regulators 
if an audit or investigation reveals a failure to comply with regulations or other improper activities  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions by either the government or the prime customer  including termination of the contract  
table of contents payment of fines and suspension or debarment from doing further business with the us government 
any of these actions would increase our expenses  reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as a reliable government supplier 
we can experience losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which would reduce our net income 
because we manufacture and sell a substantial portion of our products abroad  our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar weakens against the foreign currencies in which we denominate certain of our trade accounts payable  fixed purchase obligations and other expenses  the us dollar equivalent of such expenses would increase 
we use financial instruments  primarily short term foreign currency forward contracts  to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations 
our foreign currency hedging activities depend largely upon the accuracy of our forecasts of future sales  expenses  capital expenditures and monetary assets and liabilities 
as such  our foreign currency forward contracts may exceed or not cover our full exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
if these hedging activities are not successful  we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates 
although we believe our foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances  we can provide no assurances that we will not experience losses arising from currency fluctuations in the future  which could be significant 
any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could adversely affect our business by causing us to pay significant amounts for cleanup of hazardous materials or for damages or fines 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes in the ordinary course of our manufacturing operations 
we also are subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products  the materials that may be included in products  and the obligations of a manufacturer to dispose of these products after end users have finished using them 
if we violate environmental laws or if we occupy or occupied in the past a site at which a predecessor company caused contamination  we may be held liable for damages and the costs of remedial actions 
we cannot assure you that we will not violate environmental laws and regulations in the future as a result of human error  equipment failure or other causes 
although we estimate and regularly reassess our potential liability with respect to violations or alleged violations and accrue for such liability  we cannot assure you that our accruals will be sufficient to cover the actual costs we incur as a result of these violations or alleged violations or that no violations will not occur for which a reserve has not been established 
any increase in existing reserves or establishment of new reserves for environmental liability would reduce our net income 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could also limit our ability to expand facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with these laws and regulations 
asbestos containing materials  or acm  are present at several of our manufacturing facilities 
although the acm is being managed and controls have been put in place pursuant to acm operations and maintenance plans  the presence of acm could give rise to remediation obligations and other liabilities 
our plants generally operate under environmental permits issued by governmental authorities 
for the most part  these permits must be renewed periodically and are subject to revocation in the event of violations of environmental laws 
any such revocation could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  thereby having an adverse impact on our results of operations 
primarily as a result of certain of our acquisitions  we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination 
these liabilities include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites  including ones located in irvine  california  owego  new york  derry  new hampshire  fort lauderdale  florida  and brockville  ontario 
in addition  we have been named in a lawsuit alleging operations at our current and former facilities in orange county  california contributed to groundwater contamination 
there are some sites  including our acquired facility in gunzenhausen  germany  that are known to have groundwater contamination caused by a third party  and that third party has provided indemnity to us for the liability 
third party indemnities may not be effective to reduce our liability for environmental contamination 
for example  nortel networks  which had provided us an indemnity with respect to environmental investigation activities being undertaken at our former brockville site  is party to bankruptcy proceedings that may cause it not to fully honor its indemnification obligations to us 
the time required to perform environmental remediations can be lengthy and there can be no assurance that the scope of these activities will not increase as a result of the discovery of new contamination or contamination on adjoining landowner s properties or the adoption of more stringent regulatory standards covering sites at which we are currently performing remediation activities 
as a result  there can be no assurance that these or any other similar third party or governmental claims that may be filed in the future will not result in material liability to us 

table of contents we have also been named as a potentially responsible party at a contaminated disposal site operated by another party at the casmalia resources site in southern california  as a result of the past disposal of hazardous waste by companies we have acquired or by our corporate predecessors 
in addition  we have been named as a potentially responsible party by the california department of toxic substance control at a waste treatment site operated by another party in san jose  california  allegedly as a result of waste we sent to be treated at that facility being discharged into the environment 
although liabilities for such historical treatment and disposal activities have not materially affected our financial condition to date  we cannot assure you that past disposal activities will not result in liability that will materially affect us in the future  nor can we provide assurance that we do not have environmental exposures of which we are unaware and which could adversely affect our operating results 
over the years  environmental laws have become  and in the future may continue to become  more stringent  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations 
we operate in several environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political  business and environmental groups 
changes in or restrictions on discharge limits  emissions levels  permitting requirements and material storage or handling could require a higher than anticipated level of remediation activities  operating expenses and capital investment or  depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors  costly plant relocation 
in addition  the electronics industry became subject to the european union s rohs restriction of hazardous substances and weee waste from electrical and electronic equipment directives which took effect beginning in parallel initiatives have been adopted in other jurisdictions  including several states in the united states and the people s republic of china 
rohs prohibits the use of lead  mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and weee requires industry oems to assume responsibility for the collection  recycling and management of waste electronic products and components 
although we believe we have implemented procedures to make our manufacturing process rohs compliant  a successful assertion by a governmental entity of non compliance could result in significant costs and or penalties 
in the case of weee  the compliance responsibility rests primarily with oems rather than with ems companies 
however  oems may turn to ems companies for assistance in meeting their weee obligations  which could increase our costs 
consolidation in the electronics industry may adversely affect our business by increasing customer buying power and increasing prices we pay for components 
consolidation in the electronics industry among our customers  our suppliers and or our competitors may increase as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies 
consolidation in the electronics industry could result in an increasing number of very large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics industry 
the significant purchasing and market power of these large companies could decrease the prices paid to us by these customers 
in addition  if one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide ems services either because it has its own production facilities or relies on another provider of similar services  we may lose that customer s business 
similarly  consolidation among our suppliers could result in a sole or limited source for certain components used in our customers products 
any such consolidation could cause us to be required to pay increased prices for such components  which would reduce our gross margin and profitability 
employee theft or fraud could result in loss 
certain of our employees have access to  or signature authority with respect to  bank accounts or other company assets  which exposes us to the risk of fraud or theft 
in addition  certain employees have access to key it infrastructure and to customer and other information that is commercially valuable 
should any employee  for any reason  compromise our it systems  or misappropriate customer or other information  we could incur losses  including losses relating to claims by our customers against us  the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged and  in the case of our defense business  we could be debarred from future participation in government programs 
any losses due to employee fraud or malfeasance may not be fully covered by insurance 
we may not be successful in implementing and integrating strategic transactions or in divesting non strategic assets  which could cause our financial results to fail to meet our forecasts 
from time to time  we may undertake strategic transactions that give us the opportunity to access new customers and new end customer markets  to obtain new manufacturing and service capabilities and technologies  to enter new geographic manufacturing locations  to lower our manufacturing costs and improve our profits  and to further develop existing customer relationships 
strategic transactions involve a number of risks  uncertainties and costs  including the following integrating acquired operations and businesses including in regions or countries in which we have not previously operated  
table of contents incurring severance and other restructuring costs to rationalize any purchased operation  which would reduce our net income  obtaining regulatory approvals or other conditions to closing  which could delay the closing of strategic transactions  diverting management attention from day to day duties in order to implement and integrate strategic transactions  scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites  incurring transaction expenses  including fees of investment bankers  attorneys and accountants  which could be significant  separating operations or support infrastructure for entities divested  managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations  maintaining customer  supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and terminating unfavorable relationships  integrating the acquired company s systems into our management information systems  satisfying unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses  including liability for past violations of law and environmental liabilities  which could require the expenditure of material amounts of cash or subject us to ongoing regulatory scrutiny or requirements  operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the business acquired in which we may have little or no experience  complying with laws of new jurisdictions in which we have not previously operated  improving and expanding our management information systems to accommodate expanded operations  and losing key employees of acquired operations 
any of these factors could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of a strategic transaction  and our failure to realize these benefits could reduce our sales below and increase our costs above our forecasts and could cause write downs of the value of the business acquired which would decrease our net income 
acquisitions may also be dilutive to our earnings per share  particularly if our projections and assumptions about the acquired business future operating results prove to be inaccurate 
as a result  although the goal of our acquisitions is to improve our business and increase stockholder value  any transactions that we complete may ultimately fail to increase our sales and net income and stock price 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or infringe  or are alleged to infringe  upon intellectual property of others  we could lose sales or be required to pay significant amounts in costs or damages 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
for example  we rely in part upon patents to protect our intellectual property position 
however  a number of our patents covering certain aspects of our manufacturing processes or products have expired or will expire in the near future 
such expirations reduce our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use or sell similar technology 
any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology 
we are also subject to the risk that former employees violate the terms of their proprietary information agreements with us which require them to keep confidential and not to use for their benefit information obtained in the course of their employment with us 
should a key former employee use or disclose such information  including information concerning our customers  pricing  capabilities or strategy  our ability to obtain new customers and to compete could be adversely impacted 
finally  we may occasionally become involved in administrative proceedings  lawsuits or other proceedings if others allege that we infringe on their intellectual property rights 
some of these claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our property rights 
if successful  such claims could impair our ability to collect royalties or license fees or could force us or our customers to stop producing products that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property  at our expense  a license to sell the relevant technology at an additional cost  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology 
we sometimes design products on a contract basis or jointly with our customers 
in these situations  we may indemnify our customer against liability caused by claims that the design infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
such indemnification claims could require us to assume the defense of such a claim  the cost of which could be significant 

table of contents any of these results could reduce our revenue  increase our costs and reduce our net income and could damage our reputation with our customers 
in addition  any type of intellectual property lawsuit  whether initiated by us or a third party  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention 
we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for potential claims and losses  which could leave us responsible for certain costs and damages 
we carry various forms of business and liability insurance in types and amounts we believe are reasonable and customary for similarly situated companies in our industry 
however  we do not have insurance coverage for all of the risks and liabilities we assume in connection with the products and services we provide to our customers  including failure to comply with typical customer warranties for workmanship  product liability  intellectual property infringement and product recall claims and losses due to hacking or intrusion into our it infrastructure 
in addition  our policies generally have deductibles that would reduce the amount of our potential recoveries from insurance 
as a result  not all of our potential business losses are covered under our insurance policies 
should we sustain a significant uncovered loss  our net income would be reduced 
provisions of the dodd frank act relating to conflict minerals may increase our costs and lead to reputational challenges 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries that are believed to be benefitting armed groups 
as a result  the sec has recently adopted new due diligence  disclosure and reporting requirements for companies which manufacture products that include components containing such minerals  regardless of whether the minerals are mined in the drc or adjoining countries 
since we manufacture such products for our customers  we will be required to comply with the new sec rules  with our first required report due in may such regulations could decrease the availability and increase the prices of components used in our customers products  particularly if we choose or are required by our customers to source such components from different suppliers than we use now 
in addition  as our supply chain is complex and the method of complying with the new sec rules is unclear  we expect that the compliance process will be both time consuming and costly 
we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of minerals contained in the components included in our customers products through the due diligence procedures that we implement 
changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected  and in the future may affect  our reported financial condition or results of operations  additionally  changes in securities laws and regulations have increased  and are likely to continue to increase  our operating costs 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
our preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of those assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results 
in addition  these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions which are completed before a change is announced 
accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business  including rules relating to revenue recognition  off balance sheet transactions  stock based compensation  restructuring  acquisition accounting  asset disposals and asset retirement obligations  leases  intangible assets  derivative and other financial instruments and in process research and development charges  have recently been revised or are under review 
changes to those rules or the questioning of how we interpret or implement those rules may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business 
in addition  the anticipated convergence of us gaap and international financial accounting standards creates uncertainty as to the financial accounting policies and practices we will need to adopt in the future 
finally  corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action  sec rulemaking and stockholder advisory group policies 
as a result  the number of rules and regulations applicable to us may increase  which would also increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time management must devote to compliance activities 
for example  the sec has adopted rules requiring disclosure of the extent to which we use certain minerals in the production of our products and california has enacted regulations requiring disclosure of our business practices intended to reduce the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain 
increasing regulatory 
table of contents burdens could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers in light of an increase in actual or perceived workload and liability for serving in such positions 
outages  computer viruses  break ins  malware and similar events could disrupt our operations 
we rely on information technology networks and systems  some of which are owned and operated by third parties  to process  transmit and store electronic information 
in particular  we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions  including worldwide financial reporting  inventory management  procurement  invoicing and email communications 
any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  terrorist attacks and similar events 
despite the implementation of network security measures  our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  malware and similar disruptions 
malware  if surreptitiously installed on our systems and not timely detected and removed  could collect and disclose sensitive information relating to our customers  employees or others  exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage 
if we or our vendors are unable to prevent such outages and breaches  our operations could be disrupted 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies  including companies in the ems business 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
the market for our common stock has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility 
factors such as fluctuations in our operating results  announcements by our competitors or other events affecting companies in the electronics industry  currency fluctuations  general market fluctuations and macro economic conditions may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events 
we conduct a significant portion of our activities including manufacturing  administration and information technology management in areas that have experienced natural disasters  such as major earthquakes  hurricanes  floods and tsunamis 
for example  in march  japan experienced a major earthquake and tsunami and in october  flooding occurred in large parts of thailand 
our insurance coverage with respect to damages to our facilities or our customers products caused by natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits and  as a result  may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses 
for example  our policies do not cover damage due to earthquake 
in addition  coverage may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 
in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting one or more of our facilities  our operations and management information systems  which control our worldwide procurement  inventory management  shipping and billing activities  could be significantly disrupted 
such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to transfer production or repair  rebuild or replace the affected manufacturing facilities 
while we have disaster recovery plans in place  there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to allow our operations to continue in the event of every natural or man made disaster  pandemic or other extraordinary event 
any extended inability to continue our operations at unaffected facilities following such an event would reduce our revenue and potentially damage our reputation as a reliable supplier 
our profitability could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives 
concern over climate change has led to state  federal and international legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
while we don t expect existing or currently proposed initiatives to directly impact our business operations in the near future  these measures could over the long term lead to an increase in the cost of energy used in the manufacture of our products as a result of restrictions placed upon power generators and distributors 
we can t currently estimate the impact of any such indirect costs 
however  should our operating costs in fact rise as a result of any current  proposed or future greenhouse gas initiatives  and we are not able to pass such costs to our customers  our profitability would be reduced

table of contents item properties facilities 
our customers market numerous products throughout the world and therefore need to access manufacturing services on a global basis 
to enhance our integrated manufacturing solutions offerings  we seek to locate our facilities either near our customers and our customers end markets in major centers for the electronics industry or  when appropriate  in lower cost locations 
many of our plants located near customers and their end markets are focused primarily on final system assembly and test  while plants located in lower cost areas are engaged primarily in higher volume  less complex component and subsystem manufacturing and assembly 
we continue to evaluate our global manufacturing operations and restructure our facilities and operations to bring our manufacturing capacity in line with demand and our manufacturing strategy and to provide cost efficient services for our customers 
through this process  we have closed certain facilities not required to satisfy current demand levels 
we provide extensive operations in lower cost locations including latin america  eastern europe  china and southeast asia and we plan to expand our presence in these lower cost locations as appropriate to meet the needs of our customers 
as of september   the approximate square footage of our manufacturing facilities by country was as follows approximate square footage argentina australia brazil canada china columbia czech republic finland germany hong kong hungary india indonesia ireland israel malaysia mexico singapore south africa sweden thailand united kingdom united states total as of september   our active manufacturing facilities consist of  square feet in facilities that we own  with the remaining  square feet in leased facilities under lease terms expiring between and in addition to the above  we have  square feet of logistics and other non manufacturing space that we are currently using and  square feet of space in inactive facilities  of which  square feet is in domestic locations and  square feet is in international locations 
additionally   square feet of space in our inactive facilities is leased to third parties 
we are currently undertaking an aggressive program to sublease or terminate leases for unused facilities and to sell owned properties that are no longer expected to serve our future needs 
we regularly evaluate our expected future facilities requirements 
although we believe our existing facilities are 
table of contents adequate to meet our current requirements  we anticipate expanding two of our international facilities within the next months in order to support projected business volumes in these locations 
certifications and registrations 
certifications and registrations under industry standards are important to our business because many customers rely on them to confirm our adherence to manufacturing process and quality standards 
certain markets  such as telecommunications  medical  aviation  defense  aerospace and automotive  require adherence to industry specific standards 
substantially all of our manufacturing facilities are registered under iso  a standard published by the international organization for standardization 
as part of the iso certification process  we have a highly developed quality management system and continually improve its effectiveness in accordance with its requirements 
we use this registration to demonstrate our ability to consistently provide product that meets customer and applicable regulatory requirements and enhance customer satisfaction through its effective application 
iso registration is of particular importance to our customers throughout the world 
in addition to iso  most of our facilities are tl registered 
the tl quality system requirements and quality system metrics are designed specifically for the telecommunications industry to promote consistency and efficiency  reduce redundancy and improve customer satisfaction 
included in the tl system are performance based metrics that quantify reliability and quality performance of the product 
the majority of our facilities are also compliant with the standards set by underwriters laboratories ul 
these standards define requirements for quality  manufacturing process control and manufacturing documentation and are required by many oems in the communications sector of the electronics industry 
our medical systems division has identified certain manufacturing facilities to be centers of excellence for medical products manufacturing 
these facilities are fda and iso certified and  where appropriate  fda registered 
all facilities are fully compliant to the fda s quality systems regulations 
our defense and aerospace operations are headquartered in huntsville  alabama and are housed in a facility dedicated to meeting the specialized needs of our defense and aerospace customers 
this defense and aerospace operation is as registered and is also certified under various us military specifications as well as under ansi and other standards appropriate for defense and aerospace suppliers 
other selected operations around the world are also as registered 
our automotive facilities are strategically located worldwide 
substantially all of our automotive facilities are certified to iso ts  the automotive industry standard 
item legal proceedings non us proceedings in november and december  a non us governmental entity made certain claims for penalties against us asserting that we did not comply with bookkeeping rules in accordance with applicable tax regulations 
we have provided documents that we believe demonstrate our compliance with these tax regulations 
we have appealed the penalties in administrative court  and have not paid the penalties pending review by the court 
the administrative court has not indicated when it will issue a decision 
we believe we have a meritorious position in this matter and are contesting these claims vigorously  although there can be no assurance that these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other proceedings we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection  including those addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  the materials used in products  and the recycling  treatment and disposal of materials 
we have been named in a lawsuit alleging operations at our current and former sites in orange county  california contributed to groundwater contamination and our canadian subsidiary is party to an order of the ontario  canada ministry of environment with respect to our former brockville site requiring us to perform investigative and remediation activities 
there can be no assurance that these or any other similar third party or governmental claims will not result in material liability to us in the future 
from time to time  we may be involved in other routine legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation  that arise in the normal course of our business 
the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable
