the company s application of these policies involves assumptions that require difficult subjective judgments regarding many factors  which  in and of themselves  could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures 
a future change in the estimates  assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters  among others  could have a material impact on future financial statements and disclosures 
asset and business acquisitions the allocation of purchase price for asset and business acquisitions requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired assets and business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocations 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in determining the purchase price allocations  impairment losses could occur 
to aid in establishing the value of any intangible assets at the time of acquisition  the company typically engages a professional appraisal firm 
impairment of goodwill the company reviews goodwill to assess recoverability from future operations during the fourth quarter of each annual reporting period  and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of the company s goodwill was million at december  and zero at december  the company has elected to early adopt accounting standards update asu and first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic based on a qualitative assessment at december   the company determined the two step goodwill impairment test was not required 
significant assumptions relating to future operations must be made when estimating future cash flows in analyzing goodwill for impairment 
when the two step goodwill impairment test is performed  the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates and using an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda multiple approach 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends and economic conditions 
when the company s estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step of the impairment analysis is performed 
in this second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
at december   approximately of the company s inventories were valued under the last in  first out lifo method 
the major steel material inventory and related work in process and their finished goods are accounted for under the lifo method 
the remaining inventories were valued under the first in  first out fifo method or average cost method 
market value is estimated based on current selling prices 
estimated provisions are established for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
income taxes deferred income tax provisions are determined using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax asset positions and recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc income taxes 
retirement benefit obligations pension benefit obligations are based on various assumptions used by third party actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
revisions in assumptions and actual results that differ from the assumptions affect future expenses  cash funding requirements and obligations 
the company has three frozen defined benefit pension plans and one defined benefit plan that previously purchased a final annuity settlement 
titan expects to contribute approximately million to these frozen defined pension plans in for more information concerning these costs and obligations  see the discussion of the pensions and note to the company s financial statements
