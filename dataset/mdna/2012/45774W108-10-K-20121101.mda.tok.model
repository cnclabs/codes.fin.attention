environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations 
although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays  we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

risk factors you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on form k  including the following risk factors  before investing in any of our securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other future reports and statements that we file with the sec 
our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or reduced availability of financing in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products 
demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the availability of financing in the credit markets 
our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications 
demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity  which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control 
the tightening in the credit markets that has persisted since fiscal could continue to unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole 
future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products 
certain of our products are used in the construction of highways  bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal  state and local governments 
reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow 
our shipments are generally lower in the first and second quarters primarily due to the reduced level of construction activity resulting from winter weather conditions together with customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays 
as a result  our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors 
demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels 
demand for our products is highly variable 
the short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products 
in some cases  unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers 
the combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales  profitability and cash flows 
our customers may be adversely affected by the continued negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets 
current negative macroeconomic conditions and the tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements  thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us 
further  the reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us 
the continuation or occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material  hot rolled carbon steel wire rod 
the primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets 
beginning in fiscal  a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal in response to the increased pricing volatility  wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments  typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments 
although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated  depending upon market conditions  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations 
additionally  should raw material costs decline  our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory 
our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements 
in addition  trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duty margins by the doc against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market  which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years 
if we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements  we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner  which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs 
foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results 
our pc strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that in most market environments  domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand 
if we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers  or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower  our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted 
in response to irrationally priced import competition from offshore pc strand suppliers  we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations 
these trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market 
trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign pc strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures  operational interruptions and casualty losses 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products  including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires  explosions  accidents  adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions 
any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns  periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime 
furthermore  the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures 
although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events  our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance 
our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs 
our employee benefit costs  particularly our medical and workers compensation costs  have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise 
in march  congress passed and the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act 
this legislation may have a significant impact on health care providers  insurers and others associated with the health care industry 
if the implementation of this legislation significantly increases the costs attributable to our self insured health plans  it may negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  higher prices for natural gas  electricity  fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs 
most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers 
although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs  there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective 
if we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance 
our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities 
although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our million revolving credit facility  we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business 
a material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility  which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition 
any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms  which could adversely impact our operations  growth plans  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs 
our business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs 
these laws and regulations  which are constantly evolving  are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
our stock price can be volatile  often in connection with matters beyond our control 
equity markets in the us have been increasingly volatile in recent years 
during fiscal  our common stock traded as high as and as low as 
there are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  including variations in our quarterly and annual operating results  changes in our business outlook  changes in market valuations of companies in our industry  changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction  and announcements by us  our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations

item legal proceedings 
on november   dwyidag systems international  inc dsi filed a third party lawsuit in the ohio court of claims alleging that certain epoxy coated strand sold by us to dsi in  and supplied by dsi to the ohio department of transportation odot for a bridge project  was defective 
the third party action sought recovery of any damages which could have been assessed against dsi in the action filed against it by odot  which allegedly could have been in excess of million  plus million in damages allegedly incurred by dsi 
in  the ohio court granted our motion for summary judgment as to the third party claim against us on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired  but dsi filed an interlocutory appeal of that ruling 
in addition  we previously filed a lawsuit against dsi in the north carolina superior court in surry county seeking recovery of million plus interest owed for other products sold by us to dsi  which action was removed by dsi to the us district court for the middle district of north carolina 
on october   we participated in a structured mediation with odot and dsi which led to settlement of all of the above legal matters 
the parties dismissed the action in the middle district of north carolina on december   and the ohio court of claims action was dismissed on january  pursuant to the settlement agreement  which was approved by the ohio court of claims on january   the parties released each other from all liability arising out of the sale of strand for the bridge project 
in connection with the settlement  we reserved the remaining outstanding balance that we were owed by dsi and agreed to make a cash payment of  to odot 
during fiscal  we paid the  settlement to odot and wrote off the dsi receivables against the previously established reserve 
the resolution of this matter has enabled us to restore our commercial relationship with dsi that had existed prior to the initiation of the legal proceedings 
our fiscal results reflect a million charge relating to the net effect of the settlement 
we are also  from time to time  involved in various other lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including commercial  environmental and employment matters  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
we do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

you should carefully read the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors in this form k 
overview following our exit from the industrial wire business see note to the consolidated financial statements  our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry 
the results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our business strategy is focused on achieving leadership positions in our markets  operating as the lowest cost producer  and pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic footprint 
on november   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  iwp  purchased certain of the assets of ivy for approximately million  after giving effect to post closing adjustments 
ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of wwr and wire products for concrete construction applications see note to the consolidated financial statements 
among other assets  we acquired ivy s production facilities located in arizona  florida  missouri and pennsylvania  the production equipment located at a leased facility in texas  and certain related inventories 
we also entered into a short term sublease with ivy for the texas facility 
subsequent to the acquisition  we elected to consolidate certain of our wwr operations in order to reduce our operating costs  which involved the closure of facilities in wilmington  delaware and houston  texas 
these actions were taken in response to the close proximity of ivy s facilities in hazleton  pennsylvania and houston  texas to our existing facilities in wilmington  delaware and dayton  texas 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information  actuarial estimates  historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments  assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such  are excluded from revenue 
concentration of credit risk 
financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable 
our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution  which at times exceeds federally insured limits 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet 
we invest excess cash primarily in money market funds  which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk 
most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the us and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
there is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us 
significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances 
these judgments and estimates consider such factors as customers financial position  cash flows and payment history as well as current and expected business conditions 
it is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances 
adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers 
inventory valuation 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory 
this evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations  providing for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory  future demand  our historical experience and market conditions 
in assessing the realization of inventory values  we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions 
because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates  it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates 
adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  which consist principally of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred  the impairment loss is recognized during the period incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values 
assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell when we have committed to a disposal plan  and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns 
because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  future adjustments to these reserves may be required 
litigation 
from time to time  we may be involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur 
we record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel  the outcome of similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits and other factors 
due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions  it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates 
we monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock option grants  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units  in accordance with the provisions of financial standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
under these provisions  compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we use the monte carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  future adjustments to these estimates may be required 
assumptions for employee benefit plans 
we account for our defined employee benefit plans  the insteel wire products company retirement income plan for hourly employees  wilmington  delaware the delaware plan and the supplemental employee retirement plans each  a serp in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
under the provisions of asc topic  we recognize net periodic pension costs and value pension assets or liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rates we utilize for determining net periodic pension costs and the related benefit obligations for our plans are based  in part  on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies 
our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long term bonds 
the discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year 
the discount rate for the delaware plan and serps was  and for  and  respectively 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the delaware plan represents the estimated average rate of return expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan s assets to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
the amount of net periodic pension cost that is recorded each year is based on the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and  when appropriate  rebalance the investments in the plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation 
for  and  the assumed long term rate of return utilized for plan assets of the delaware plan was 
we currently expect to use the same assumed rate for the long term return on plan assets in in determining the appropriateness of this assumption  we considered the historical rate of return of the plan assets  the current and projected asset mix  our investment objectives and information provided by our third party investment advisors 
the projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the serps are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels 
our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and management s intentions regarding future compensation increases  which generally approximates average long term inflation rates 
assumed discount rates and rates of return on plan assets are reevaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in the recognition of materially different pension costs over different periods and materially different asset and liability amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter lives than assumed in the mortality tables that are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
under gaap  actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income over future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
however  any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains 
the amounts recognized as net periodic pension cost and as pension assets or liabilities are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used for determining the net periodic pension costs and pension assets or liabilities related to the delaware plan are reasonable and appropriate 
the funding requirements for the delaware plan are based upon applicable regulations  and will generally differ from the amount of pension cost recognized under asc topic for financial reporting purposes 
during and  we made contributions totaling  and  respectively  to the delaware plan 
no contributions were required to be made to the delaware plan during we currently expect net periodic pension costs for to be  for the delaware plan and  for the serps 
cash contributions to the plans during are expected to be  for the delaware plan and  for the serps 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate for the delaware plan would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of september  by approximately  and have no impact on the expected net periodic pension cost for a decrease in the assumed discount rate for our serps would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of september  by approximately  and  respectively  and the net periodic pension cost for by approximately  a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the delaware plan would have increased the expected net periodic pension cost for by approximately  recent accounting pronouncements 
future adoptions in june  the fasb issued an update that amends the guidance provided in asc topic  comprehensive income  by requiring that all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this update becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal results of operations statements of operations selected data dollars in thousands year ended september  change october  change october  net sales gross profit percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expense percentage of net sales other income  net restructuring charges  net  n m gain on early extinguishment of debt n m n m acquisition costs  n m bargain purchase gain n m legal settlement n m  interest expense interest income effective income tax rate n m n m earnings loss from continuing operations  n m n m earnings from discontinued operations n m n m net earnings loss  n m n m n m not meaningful compared with net sales net sales increased to million in from million in shipments for the year increased and average selling prices increased from the prior year levels 
the increase in shipments was primarily due to the full year contribution of the ivy facilities in the increase in average selling prices was driven by price increases that were implemented to recover higher raw material costs 
sales for both years reflect severely depressed volumes due to the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end markets 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the year over year decline was primarily due to the narrowing of spreads between selling prices and raw material costs resulting from competitive pricing pressures 
gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs largely driven by reduced operating schedules 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense decreased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in primarily due to the relative year over year changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies  an increase in the net gains on the settlement of life insurance policies  and a reduction in consulting and professional services expense 
the cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased  in the current year compared with a decrease of  in the prior year due to the related changes in the value of the underlying investments 
these reductions in sg a expense were partially offset by higher employee benefit costs  and bad debt expense 
the increase in employee benefit costs expense was primarily related to an increase in supplemental retirement plan expense 
gain on early extinguishment of debt a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of  was recorded in for the discount on our prepayment of the remaining balance outstanding on the subordinated note that was issued in connection with the ivy acquisition 
restructuring charges  net net restructuring charges decreased to  in from million in the year over year decrease is primarily due to reduced restructuring activities associated with the ivy acquisition during net restructuring charges for included  for equipment relocation costs and  for facility closure costs less  of net proceeds from the sale of decommissioned equipment and a  adjustment related to the remaining employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions 
net restructuring charges of million in the prior year included million for impairment charges related to plant closures and the decommissioning of equipment  million for employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions  million for equipment relocation costs   for the future lease obligations associated with the closed houston  texas facility and  for facility closure costs 
the plant closure costs were incurred in connection with the consolidation of our texas and northeast operations  which involved the closure of facilities in houston  texas and wilmington  delaware  and the absorption of the business by other insteel facilities 
the plant closure costs are net of a million gain on the sale of the wilmington  delaware facility 
the employee separation costs were related to the staffing reductions that were implemented across our sales  administration and manufacturing support functions to address the redundancies resulting from the ivy acquisition and in connection with the plant closures 
acquisition costs acquisition costs of million were incurred in for the advisory  accounting  legal and other professional fees directly related to the ivy acquisition

we may elect to make additional adjustments in our operating activities should the current recessionary conditions in our construction end markets persist  which could materially impact our cash requirements

investing activities of discontinued operations provided million of cash in from the proceeds on the sale of the real estate associated with our discontinued industrial wire business 
our investing activities are largely discretionary  providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken 
financing activities financing activities used million of cash in  million in and million in cash dividend payments were million in  and net debt repayments used million of cash in and financing costs incurred in connection with the amendment of our credit facility used million 
cash management our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution  which at times exceeds federally insured limits 
we invest excess cash primarily in money market funds  which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk 
credit facility we have a revolving credit facility the credit facility that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital  capital expenditure  general corporate and growth requirements 
on february   we entered into an amendment agreement that  among other changes  increased the commitment amount of the credit facility from million to million and extended the maturity date from june  to june  as of september   million was outstanding on the credit facility  million of additional borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year  ordinary course borrowings on the credit facility were as high as million 
as of october    was outstanding on the credit facility 
as part of the consideration for the ivy acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements  we entered into a million secured subordinated promissory note the note payable to ivy over five years 
the note required semi annual interest payments in arrears  and annual principal payments payable on november of each year during the period the note yielded interest on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate of per annum and was collateralized by certain of the real property and equipment acquired from ivy 
on december   the company prepaid the remaining balance that was outstanding on the note for million  which represented a discount of  that was recorded as a gain from early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations 
we believe that  in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands  cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  and share repurchases  if any 
we also expect to have access to the amounts available under our credit facility 
however  further deterioration of market conditions in the construction sector could result in additional reductions in demand from our customers  which would likely reduce our operating cash flows 
under such circumstances  we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures  delay or restrict share repurchases  cease dividend payments and or realign our working capital requirements 
should we determine  at any time  that we require additional short term liquidity  we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that are potentially available to provide such funding 
there can be no assurance that any such financing  if pursued  would be obtained  or if obtained  would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us 
however  we believe that our strong balance sheet  flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our credit facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation we are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material  hot rolled steel wire rod  and  to a much lesser extent  freight  energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes 
we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives 
however  our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics  and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs 
during and  wire rod prices rose due to the escalation in the cost of scrap and other raw materials for wire rod producers and increased demand from non construction applications 
after initially rising in the first half of  wire rod prices declined during the latter part of the year due to reductions in the cost of scrap for wire rod producers and weakening demand 
our ability to fully recover higher wire rod prices during this period has been mitigated by competitive pricing pressures resulting from the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end markets 
the timing and magnitude of any future increases in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  as defined by item a of regulation s k of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations and commitments at september  are as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years raw material purchase commitments supplemental employee retirement plan obligations borrowings on revolving credit facility pension benefit obligations operating leases trade letters of credit commitment fee on unused portion of credit facility unrecognized tax benefit obligations other unconditional purchase obligations total non cancelable purchase commitments for raw materials 
contractual commitments for capital expenditures 
outlook as we look ahead to  our visibility remains limited due to the heightened degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for a recovery in the economy and employment market  the availability of financing in the credit markets and the increased volatility in raw material costs 
conditions in our construction end markets appear to have stabilized following the steep decline in demand that we have experienced in recent years 
however  we have yet to see signs of a pronounced recovery taking hold in our markets and believe that construction activity is likely to continue trending at depressed levels pending a more substantive upturn in the economy 
in response to the challenges facing us  we will continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business closely managing and controlling our expenses  aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs  and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing  selling and administrative activities 
we expect the contributions from the ivy acquisition to increase during the year through the realization of additional operational synergies and the reconfiguration of our combined wwr operations  which was completed in as market conditions improve  we also expect gradually increasing contributions from the substantial investments we have made in our facilities in the form of reduced operating costs and additional capacity to support future growth see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate further potential acquisitions in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary 
commodity prices we are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material  hot rolled steel wire rod  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
we negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods most recently monthly for domestic suppliers  depending upon market conditions  to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod 
our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign taxes  duties  tariffs and other trade actions 
although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time  depending upon market conditions and competitive dynamics  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased wire rod costs through higher selling prices  which would reduce our gross profit and cash flow from operations 
additionally  should wire rod costs decline  our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory 
based on our shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales  a increase in the price of steel wire rod would have resulted in a million decrease in our annual pre tax earnings assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices 
interest rates borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
based on our interest rate exposure and the outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility as of september   a basis point change in interest rates would have an estimated  impact on our pre tax earnings over a one year period 
foreign exchange exposure we have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars  as such transactions have not been material historically 
we will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case by case basis 
there were no forward contracts outstanding as of september  during fiscal  a increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
