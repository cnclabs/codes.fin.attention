recent developments in june  the company acquired charming shoppes  which owns and operates multiple retail brands through over  retail stores and e commerce operations including lane bryant  catherines  fashion bug  and figi s  in an all cash transaction at per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million excluding the assumption of debt and transaction costs  and collectively  the charming shoppes acquisition 
the acquisition was partially funded with million from new borrowings  including a a million six year  variable rate term loan and b million of borrowings under the company s existing revolving credit facility  which was amended in connection with the transaction 
the remainder was funded through available cash and cash equivalents and the liquidation of substantially all of the company s investment portfolio 
based on the results of its strategic review of charming shoppes s operations  the company announced  contemporaneously with the closing of the charming shoppes acquisition  its intent to cease operating the acquired fashion bug business 
the fashion bug business  consisting of approximately retail stores  is expected to be closed down by early in calendar year through an orderly liquidation of the related net assets 
in addition  the company also announced  contemporaneously with the closing of the charming shoppes acquisition  its intent to sell the acquired figi s business 
the figi s business  which markets food and specialty gift products  is expected to be sold by the one year anniversary date of the closing of the charming shoppes acquisition 
given the company s intent to exit both of those businesses  their financial position and operating results have been classified as discontinued operations within the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company 
our objectives and risks objectives our core strengths include a portfolio of value oriented  lifestyle brands serving the female customer at various levels of maturity and sizes  beginning from age this portfolio of brands is well complemented by a strong and experienced management team  a disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet 
despite the various risks associated with the current global economic environment as further discussed below  we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long term sustainable growth in revenue  net income and operating cash flow 
we continue to focus on a number of ongoing key initiatives aimed at increasing our profitability and integrating newly acquired businesses  including reducing expenses and improving our comparative store sales trends 
these initiatives include  but are not limited to  the following integration of charming shoppes we recently completed our acquisition of charming shoppes and are currently performing an operational and strategic assessment of its businesses and existing cost structure for integration purposes 
among other areas  we are evaluating how best to integrate our respective companies technology platforms  sourcing operations and supply chain operations 
as a result of this assessment  we expect to identify a number of cost reduction opportunities in connection with anticipated operational efficiencies and the streamlining of corporate overhead 
once identified  those actions will begin to be implemented in fiscal store expansion we have been exploring  and will continue to explore  expansion opportunities both within our current market areas and in other regions  including international expansion 
during fiscal  for our legacy family of brands  we opened a net stores  including net openings of stores at justice  net openings of stores at maurices  and partially offset by net closings of stores at dressbarn 
during fiscal  we currently plan to open approximately net new stores in the aggregate for all our brands 
during fiscal  our justice brand continued to increase its international presence by opening stores in canada for a total of stores 
justice plans to open an additional stores in canada during fiscal in addition  maurices expanded into canada during fiscal by opening stores  with plans to open an additional stores in fiscal e commerce over the past couple of years  the company has focused on better developing its e commerce channel across all brands 
excluding the newly acquired businesses of charming shoppes  total e commerce revenues amounted to approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately over the prior year period 
we continue to develop our e commerce platform and believe this will be an ongoing source of sales growth in future periods for both our legacy family of brands and those of the newly acquired charming shoppes 
cost savings initiatives over the past couple of years  we have centralized certain of our distribution center operations  our information technology operations  and our payroll processing operations 
in addition  our ongoing project to consolidate certain of our financial systems and processes across our legacy family of brands  including a common general ledger and consolidations platform  is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal we expect to continue to leverage our shared resource centers among brands  particularly with regards to the integration of charming shoppes 
we believe these efforts will continue to lead to increased cost savings and efficiencies in future periods 
risks there are trends and other factors  including those described below  which we face as a women s and girls specialty apparel retailer that could have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations  see part i  item a risk factors of the fiscal k 
general economic conditions 
our performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending 
some of the factors negatively impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions  wages and high unemployment  high consumer debt  reductions in net worth based on severe market declines such as in residential real estate markets  increased taxation  higher fuel  energy and other prices  increasing interest rates  and low consumer confidence 
in addition  any significant volatility in our financial markets  as has been experienced in the past  could also negatively impact the levels of future discretionary consumer spending 
while the us and certain other international economies have improved since the global financial crisis commenced in fall  a prolonged economic downturn and slow recovery  including high rates of unemployment  rising commodity prices and declining real estate market values  could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
integration of charming shoppes 
the success of the charming shoppes acquisition will depend on our ability to manage both operations  to realize opportunities for revenue growth  and to eliminate redundant and excess costs 
achieving the anticipated benefits of integrating charming shoppes may present a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
weather conditions 
weather conditions can affect our net sales because inclement weather may discourage travel or require temporary store closures  thereby reducing customer traffic 
unseasonably warmer weather during typically colder months or unseasonably colder weather during typically warmer months can also affect the seasonal composition and demand for our merchandise 
price increases 
the raw materials used to manufacture our products  in particular cotton  and our transportation and contract manufacturing labor costs  are subject to availability constraints and price volatility 
we have recently seen an increase in such costs  although cotton prices have begun to moderate 
in response to these price increases  we have moderately increased merchandise prices on certain items in each of our brands and may  in the future  need to further increase merchandise prices in order to maintain our merchandise margins 
consequently  higher product costs could have a negative effect on our gross profit margin and increased selling prices could have a negative effect on our sales volume 
seasonality of business 
our business is typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back to school shopping periods 
in particular  justice sales and operating profits tend to be significantly higher during the fall season which occurs during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  as this includes the back to school period and the holiday selling period which is focused on gift giving merchandise 
the dressbarn and maurices brands have historically experienced lower earnings in the second fiscal quarter ending in january than during the three other fiscal quarters  reflecting the intense promotional environment that generally has characterized the holiday shopping season in recent years 
the newly acquired lane bryant and catherines brands typically experience peak sales during the easter  memorial day and december holiday seasons 
in addition  our operating results and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on  among other things  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in merchandise mix 
competition 
the retail apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented  with numerous competitors  including department stores  off price retailers  specialty stores  discount stores  mass merchandisers and internet based retailers  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
many of our competitors are able to engage in aggressive promotions  reducing their selling prices 
some of our competitors include walmart  macy s  jcpenney  kohl s  old navy  aeropostale  target and sears 
other competitors may move into the markets that we serve  particularly in the plus size women s apparel market where we have a high concentration of sales 
our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts  and to changes in customer tastes and preferences 
if we fail to compete successfully  we could face lower net sales and may need to offer greater discounts to our customers  which could result in decreased profitability 
we believe that we have established and reinforced our image as a source of fashion and value by focusing on our target customers  and by offering superior customer service and convenience 
customer tastes and fashion trends 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and can change rapidly 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
if we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines  our sales will be lower and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory 
in response  we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
basis of presentation discontinued operations as discussed more fully under the section entitled recent developments  the newly acquired businesses of fashion bug and figi s have been presented as discontinued operations within the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company 
common stock split on april   the company effected a two for one common stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
all common share and per common share data  except par value per share  presented in md a and in the consolidated financial statements has been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s stock split and the effect of this change 
segment information reclassification historically  the company was a single brand retailer operating under the name of dressbarn 
as such  all corporate overhead costs were reported historically within the dressbarn operating segment 
as the company s legal entity structure evolved with the acquisitions of the maurices brand in the fiscal year ended on july  fiscal and the justice brand in fiscal  the company allocated approximately million of corporate overhead costs annually to each of those operating segments from the dressbarn operating segment 
the remainder of the corporate overhead costs continued to be reported primarily within the dressbarn operating segment 
in january  the company completed an internal corporate reorganization and established a new holding company  named ascena retail group  inc  to own the interests of each of the dressbarn  maurices  and justice brands through wholly owned subsidiaries 
in connection therewith  beginning in fiscal  the company implemented a new methodology to allocate corporate overhead costs to each of its operating segments on a reasonable basis 
in order to conform to this new cost allocation methodology  the company has recasted historically reported segment operating results in order to enhance the comparability of its segmental operating performance 
there have been no changes in total net sales  total operating income or total depreciation and amortization expense as a result of this change 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s segment information and the effect of this change 
occupancy  distribution and buying costs historically  the company included occupancy  distribution and buying costs within cost of goods sold on the face of its statement of operations 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with conforming the financial presentation of charming shoppes  the company decided to present each of the aggregate of occupancy  distribution and buying costs and gross margin separately on the face of its statement of operations 
in addition  certain costs  such as store utility costs  were reclassified from selling  general and administrative expenses to occupancy  distribution and buying costs 
financial information for all prior periods has been reclassified in order to conform to the current period s presentation 
there have been no changes in historical operating income or historical net income for any period as a result of these changes 
other reclassifications certain other immaterial reclassifications also have been made to the prior period s financial information in order to conform to the current period s presentation 
summary of financial performance operating results in fiscal  we reported net sales of  million  income from continuing operations of million and net income from continuing operations per diluted share of 
this compares to net sales of  million  income from continuing operations of million and net income from continuing operations per diluted share of in fiscal including a million loss in fiscal on the discontinued operations of fashion bug and figi s  net income was million and net income per diluted share was in fiscal our operating performance for fiscal was positively affected by a increase in net sales  consisting of organic growth from our legacy family of brands and growth from the charming shoppes acquisition 
the increase in net sales from our legacy family of brands was driven by both our comparable store sales and new store growth  as well as strong growth in e commerce sales 
while our gross margin rate declined basis points to  this was mainly due to the effect of the charming shoppes acquisition  which included an unfavorable  non cash purchase accounting adjustment of approximately million for fiscal associated with the write up of charming shoppes s inventory to fair market value 
the gross margin rate for our legacy family of brands declined only basis points to due largely to lower margins at dressbarn and maurices relating to increased markdowns 
operating income increased million  consisting of a million increase from our legacy family of brands and a million decrease relating to the charming shoppes acquisition 
the operating loss from charming shoppes reflected million of acquisition related integration and restructuring costs and the approximate million non cash inventory expense mentioned above 
in turn  the increased operating income from our legacy family of brands primarily reflected the flow through of margin on the higher sales volume  offset in part by increased operating costs 
the provision for income taxes from continuing operations decreased by million to million 
the effective tax rate decreased basis points  to for fiscal  from for fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of the reversal of certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal income from continuing operations increased million to million as the increase in operating income and lower tax provision described above were offset  in part  by million of one time  acquisition related costs relating to the charming shoppes acquisition 
net income from continuing operations per diluted share increased by  or  to per share for fiscal from per share for fiscal the increase in diluted earnings per share results was primarily due to the higher level of net income and a reduction in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding relating to our common stock repurchase program 
financial condition and liquidity our financial position reflects the overall relative strength of our business results  along with the financial effects of the charming shoppes acquisition 
we ended fiscal in a net debt position total cash and cash equivalents  plus short term and non current investments less total debt of million  compared to a million of net cash and investments as of the end of fiscal the change in our financial position was primarily due to the use of cash and borrowings to fund the charming shoppes acquisition  our treasury stock repurchases and capital expenditures  partially offset by our cash flows generated from operations 
our equity increased to billion as of july   compared to billion as of july   primarily due to our net income during fiscal we generated million of cash from operations during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  a significant portion of our available cash was used to fund the charming shoppes acquisition  to support our common stock repurchase program and to reinvest in our business through capital spending

we also used million for capital expenditures primarily associated with our retail store expansion and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure

these market risks include  but are not limited to  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our expanding canadian and other international operations  changes in interest rates  and changes in both the value and liquidity of our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
consequently  in the normal course of business  we employ a number of established policies and procedures to manage such risks  including considering  at times  the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
however  as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

purchases of inventory for resale in our retail stores normally are transacted in us dollars

with the current financial environment and the instability of some financial institutions  we cannot be assured we will not experience losses on our deposits in the future 
however  there have been no losses recorded on deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date 
we evaluate investments held in unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
such evaluation involves a variety of considerations  including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers 
factors we considered include i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost  ii the financial condition  credit worthiness and near term prospects of the issuer  iii the length of time to maturity  iv future economic conditions and market forecasts  v our intent and ability to retain our investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value  and vi an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell our investment before recovery of market value 
there has been no other than temporary impairments recorded on our investment securities during any of the periods presented 
critical accounting policies the sec s financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the company s estimates are often based on complex judgments  probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable  but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
it is also possible that other professionals  applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts 
the company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr for a discussion of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see notes and to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued using the retail method of accounting and is stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventory at cost and resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the retail method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial merchandise markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the company continuously reviews its inventory levels to identify slow moving merchandise and necessary markdowns to clear slow moving merchandise  which reduces the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value 
consideration is given to a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including current pricing levels and the anticipated need for subsequent markdowns  aging of inventories  historical sales trends  and the impact of market trends and economic conditions 
estimates of markdown requirements may differ from actual results due to changes in quantity  quality and mix of products in inventory  as well as changes in consumer preferences  market and economic conditions 
the company s historical estimates of these costs and its markdown provisions have not differed materially from actual results 
reserves for inventory shrinkage  representing the risk or physical loss of inventory  are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts 
sales returns reserves a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales return reserves  which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized 
in particular  retail revenue  including e commerce sales  is reduced by estimates of returns 
in determining estimates of returns  management analyzes historical trends  seasonal results  current economic and market conditions and store performance 
the company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis 
the company s historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives  are not amortized 
rather  goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and  along with other long lived assets  are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company reviews and considers appraisals from independent valuation firms 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables 
the impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess 
in addition  in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability  we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value 
the company recorded non cash impairment charges of million in its maurices segment in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the studio y trade name to its estimated fair value 
the company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the results of the impairment assessment as of june   the company confirmed that the fair value of its reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values and that there were no reporting units that were at risk of impairment 
additionally  there has been no impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill during any of the three fiscal years presented 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment  along with other long lived assets  are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
in evaluating long lived assets for recoverability  we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value  considering external market participant assumptions 
assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining future cash flows  the company takes various factors into account  including changes in merchandising strategy  the emphasis on retail store cost controls  the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending  and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising 
since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance  there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded non cash impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  to reduce the net carrying value of certain long lived assets to their estimated fair value

insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation and employee healthcare benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
such liabilities are capped through the use of stop loss contracts with insurance companies 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
as of july  and july   these reserves were million and million  respectively 
the company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to insurance and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
the company is self insured for expenses related to its employee medical and dental plans  and its workers compensation plan  up to certain thresholds 
claims filed  as well as claims incurred but not reported  are accrued based on management s estimates  using information received from plan administrators  historical analysis and other relevant data 
the company s stop loss insurance coverage for individual claims ranges between  and  depending on which of the company s multiple insurance carriers the associate is insured under 
the company believes its accruals for claims and contingencies are adequate based on information currently available 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded accruals for claims and contingencies 
stock based compensation the company expenses all share based payments to employees and non employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
stock options stock options are granted to certain of its employees and non employee directors with exercise prices equal to or exceeding fair market value at the date of grant 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events 
the key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option  the expected stock price volatility factor  the expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate  among others 
generally  once stock option values are determined  current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed  even if the estimates used are different from the actuals 
determining the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management  including estimates of the above black scholes assumptions 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  if management changes its assumptions for future stock based award grants  or if there are changes in market conditions  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus the company grants restricted shares of common stock and service based rsus to certain of its employees and non employee directors 
in addition  the company grants performance based rsus to senior executives and other key executives  and certain other employees of the company 
the fair values of restricted stock shares and rsus are based on the fair value of unrestricted common stock 
compensation expense for performance based rsus is recognized over the related service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable  which involves judgment on the part of management 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income taxes ie  deferred tax assets and liabilities  current taxes payable refunds receivable and tax expense are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between us generally accepted accounting principles and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating loss  capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  as determined under enacted tax laws and rates 
the company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment 
in addition  valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur  or circumstances change  that warrant adjustments to those balances 
in determining the income tax provision for financial reporting purposes  the company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
if the company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  it recognizes the tax benefit 
the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement  presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
these assessments can be complex and require significant judgment  and the company often obtains assistance from external advisors 
to the extent that the company s estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
if the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit  the company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if i there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not  ii the statute of limitations expires  or iii there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency 
uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months 
interest and penalties  if any  are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the company s consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
contingencies we are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  including certain litigations  contractual disputes  employee relation matters  various tax audits  and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes 
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable 
in addition  if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability  we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
management considers many factors in making these assessments 
as the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable  these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions 
as a result  the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards which may impact our financial statements in future reporting periods
