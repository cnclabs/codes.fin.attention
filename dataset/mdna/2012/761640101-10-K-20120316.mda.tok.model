overview our company resulted from the merger of corporate road show 
com inc  a new york corporation incorporated in november  cprd and rexahn  corp  a maryland corporation  immediately after giving effect to our reincorporation as a delaware corporation under the name rexahn pharmaceuticals  inc in connection with that transaction  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into rexahn  corp  with rexahn  corp remaining as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
in exchange for their shares of capital stock in rexahn  corp  the former stockholders of rexahn  corp received shares of common stock representing approximately of the company s outstanding equity after giving effect to the transaction 
further  upon the effective time of the merger  our historic business was abandoned and the business plan of rexahn  corp was adopted 
the transaction was therefore accounted for as a reverse acquisition with rexahn  corp as the accounting acquiring party and cprd as the acquired party 
in september  rexahn  corp was merged with and into the company 
our efforts and resources have been focused primarily on acquiring and developing our pharmaceutical technologies  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
we are a development stage company and have no product sales to date and we will not receive any product sales until we receive approval from the fda or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin selling our pharmaceutical candidates 
our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private financings  primarily private sales of common stock and debt securities  and collaboration agreements with our strategic investors 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies are in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and their basis of application is consistent with that of the previous year 
our significant estimates include assumptions made in estimating the fair values of stock based compensation and our assessment relating to the impairment of intangible assets and deferred revenues 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of third party service costs under research and development agreements  salaries and related personnel costs  as well as stock compensation related to these costs  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 

index costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage that have no alternative future uses and are for unapproved product compounds are expensed as incurred 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements for cash and cash equivalents  prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of these financial instruments 
the fair value methodology for our warrant liabilities and put feature on common stock is described in detail in item of this form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates 
asc requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all portions of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryback and carryforward periods and existing contracts that will result in future profits 
income tax expense is recorded for the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the period  increased or decreased by the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
as a result of the company s significant cumulative losses  we determined that it was appropriate to establish a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe that as a result of our losses sustained to date  any examination would result in a reduction of our net operating loss carryforward rather than a tax liability 
as such  we have not provided for additional taxes estimated under asc warrant liabilities in accordance with asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity  we record warrant liabilities at fair value due to provisions in our warrant agreements  as discussed in footnote of item of this form k 
we reevaluate the fair value of our warrants at each reporting period  and changes in the fair value between reporting periods is recorded as unrealized gain loss on fair value of warrants in the statement of operations 
put feature on common stock we extended anti dilution protection provisions on our common stock to our investors in our december and march financings  whereby in the event that we sell or issue shares below the effective purchase price paid  the investors would thereupon receive additional shares in a ratio outlined in the securities purchase agreement 
in accordance with asc topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity  this feature is a written put on our common stock  and is classified as a liability at fair value 
we reevaluate the fair value at each reporting period  and changes in the fair value are recorded as unrealized gain on put feature on common stock in the statement of operations 

index stock based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including employee stock options  are to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  the company adheres to the guidance set forth within securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding the interaction between asc and certain sec rules and regulations  and provides interpretations with respect to the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets to be held and used are analyzed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
if there are indications of impairment  the company uses future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded asset values  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
management determined that an impairment of intangible assets occurred in and wrote off the assets remaining carrying value of  concentration of credit risk asc  financial instruments  requires disclosure of any significant off balance sheet risk and credit risk concentration 
the company does not have significant off balance sheet risk or credit concentration 
the company maintains cash and short term investments with major financial institutions 
from time to time the company has funds on deposit with commercial banks that exceed federally insured limits 
the balances are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation up to  at december   the company s uninsured cash balances was  management does not consider this to be a significant credit risk as the banks are large  established financial institutions 
recent accounting pronouncements affecting the company fair value measurements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update to accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc which amends the disclosure requirements for fair value instruments 
the new disclosures required include disclosure regarding the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs  and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs 
the guidance is effective for the company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  we believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for presentation and disclosure of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
under the new guidance  a company may no longer present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in the statement of stockholder s equity  and instead must present the components of comprehensive income either in the statement of operations or in a separate statement immediately following the statement of operations 
in addition  reclassification adjustments between comprehensive income and net income must be disclosed on the financial statements 
this guidance is effective for the company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  we believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements

general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributed to investor relations services provided by two firms  for which we issued compensatory stock valued at  the agreements with these firms had been terminated in november   therefore  we did not incur these investor relations services in research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development and other expenses relating to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our drug candidates 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the costs associated with the serdaxin phase iib trial  where we incurred approximately  for the year ended december  the increase is also attributable to costs incurred for our preclinical compounds  particularly rx  where we incurred approximately  in patent fees our patent fees increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to legal costs to respond to additional patent applications  and translation fees associated with regionalizing patents in additional foreign jurisdictions for the year ended december

research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development and other expenses relating to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our drug candidates 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the costs associated with the commencement of serdaxin s phase iib clinical trial in the fourth quarter  and the ongoing development of rx research and development costs also increased due to costs associated with the phase ii clinical trials of archexin and zoraxel  as well as pre clinical pipeline development 
research and development expenses were offset by a grant of  from the federal government which we were eligible for under the qualified therapeutic discovery project program

index research and development projects research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage and have no alternative future uses are expensed as incurred 
our research and development programs are related to our oncology clinical stage drug candidate  archexin  our cns candidates serdaxin and zoraxel and pre clinical stage drug candidates  rx  rx  rx  rx  rx nano  rx nano  and nano polymer anticancer drugs 
each of our drug candidates is in various stages of completion as described below 
as we expand our clinical studies  we will enter into additional development agreements 
significant additional expenditures will be required if we complete our clinical trials  start new trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  expand our operations and bring our products to market 
the eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of uncertainties such as trial design  the length of the trial  the number of clinical sites and the number of patients 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
because the successful development of our most advanced drug candidates  archexin  serdaxin and zoraxel  is uncertain  and because rx  rx  rx  rx  rx nano  rx nano  and nano polymer anticancer drugs are in early stage development  we are unable to estimate the costs of completing our research and development programs  the timing of bringing such programs to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows could commence from the sale of these drug candidates 
if these projects are not completed as planned  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 
the table below summarizes the amounts spent on each of our research and development projects through december  cumulative from march  inception to december  clinical candidates archexin serdaxin zoraxel preclinical candidates rx other preclinical compounds 
index archexin archexin is a nucleotide single stranded dna anti sense molecule  which we believe is a first in class inhibitor of the protein kinase akt 
akt plays critical roles in cancer cell proliferation  survival  angiogenesis  metastasis  and drug resistance 
archexin received orphan drug designation from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for five cancer indications renal cell carcinoma  or rcc  glioblastoma  ovarian cancer  stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer 
the fda orphan drug program provides seven years of marketing exclusivity after approval and tax incentives for clinical research 
in october  we announced the conclusion of the phase i clinical trial of archexin  our leading oncology drug candidate 
the phase i clinical trial of archexin  which took place at georgetown university and the university of alabama  was an open label  dose escalation study with day continuous infusion in patients with solid tumors 
the phase i trial was intended primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of archexin in patients with advanced cancer 
the trial results showed that the dose limiting toxicity of archexin occurring at mg m dose in the form of fatigue 
no other serious adverse events such as hematological toxicities were observed in this phase i study 
in the phase i study stable disease was observed in two out of the patients 
archexin is currently being studied in a phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer with enrollment completed in september   with results are currently anticipated in the third quarter of the archexin phase iia trial is a single arm  open label study and is being conducted globally in the united states and india 
archexin will be administered in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer to assess safety and preliminary efficacy  maximum tolerated dose  and overall survival 
we own one issued us patent for archexin 
the costs incurred for the phase i clinical trial was approximately  as of december   we have spent approximately  for the development of archexin and we estimate that the phase iia trials for pancreatic cancer patients will be completed in the third quarter of and will require approximately an additional  to complete 
serdaxin rx serdaxin is an extended release formulation of clavulanic acid  which is an ingredient present in antibiotics approved by the fda 
we had been developing serdaxin for the treatment of depression and neurodegenerative disorders 
from january to september   we conducted a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study compared two doses of serdaxin  mg and mg  to placebo over an week treatment period for major depressive disorder mdd patients 
on november   we released results that the study showed serdaxin did not demonstrate efficacy compared to a placebo group as measured by the montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs 
all groups showed an approximate point improvement in the protocol defined primary endpoint of madrs  and had a substantial number of patients who demonstrated a meaningful clinical improvement from baseline 
the study showed that serdaxin was safe and well tolerated 
at this point  we have not made any determinations of serdaxin s future paths and have not allocated resources to the further development of serdaxin for treatment for mdd 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately  for costs associated with the phase iib trial for serdaxin 
through december   the pre clinical and clinical costs incurred for development of serdaxin to date have been approximately  we estimate the phase iib trial has approximately  of additional costs that will be paid in of zoraxel rx zoraxel is an immediate release formulation of clavulanic acid  the same active ingredient found in our product candidate serdaxin 
the phase iia proof of concept  completed with positive results  was a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled and dose ranging mg  mg  mg study of erectile dysfunction patients ages of to treated with zoraxel 
the phase iib study is designed to assess zoraxel s efficacy in approximately male subjects  ages to  with ed 
the double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  week study will include iief as the primary endpoint following treatment with zoraxel at and mg doses 
however  given the recently reported results of the serdaxin phase iib clinical trial  we are currently evaluating how to proceed with the phase iib study for zoraxel 

index through december   the costs incurred for development of zoraxel to date have been approximately  we currently estimate that these phase iib studies would require approximately  throughout and pre clinical pipeline on september   we closed on a securities purchase agreement with teva pharmaceutical industries limited teva  under which teva purchased  shares of our common stock for million 
contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of this agreement  the parties executed a research and exclusive license option agreement relo pursuant to which we agreed to use  from the gross proceeds of the issuance and sale of shares to teva to fund a research and development program for the pre clinical development of rx on january   we entered into a second amendment with teva to the securities purchase agreement closed in september  pursuant to the terms of the amendment  teva purchased  shares of our common stock in a private offering for gross proceeds of million 
the investment by teva is restricted to further supporting the research and development program for the pre clinical development of rx we will be eligible to receive royalties on net sales of rx worldwide 
this compound may enter an exploratory early stage clinical study during the first quarter of rx may enter phase i clinical trials during the first half of rx  rx  rx nano  rx nano and rx are in a pre clinical stage of development 
through december   the costs incurred for development of these compounds to date have been approximately  the estimated cost to complete pre clinical toxicology and phase i clinical trials is estimated to be approximately  per each compound 
the conduct of the clinical trial and toxicology studies described above are being accomplished in conjunction with third party clinical research organizations at external locations 
this business practice is typical for the pharmaceutical industry and companies like us 
as a result  the risk of completion or delay of these studies is not within our direct control and a program delay may occur due to circumstances outside our control 
a delay in any of these programs may not necessarily have a direct impact on our daily operations 
however  a delay could result in additional expenses for us 
we will need to raise additional money through debt and or equity offerings in order to continue to develop our drug candidates 
if we are not able to raise sufficient additional money  we will have to reduce our research and development activities 
we will first reduce research and development activities associated with our preclinical compounds 
to the extent necessary  we will then reduce our research and development activities related to some or all of our clinical drugs

if we are not able to secure additional financing  we will not be able to implement and fund the research and development 
however  the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following the progress of our product development activities  the number and scope of our product development programs  the progress of our pre clinical and clinical trial activities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into collaboration agreements  our ability to maintain current collaboration programs and to establish new collaboration arrangements  the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of regulatory approvals 
impact of inflation to date inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for the year ended december   we are exposed to the following market risks interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments 
at december   our cash was invested primarily in short term bank deposits and municipal obligations  all of which were denominated in us dollars 
due to the conservative nature of these investments  which primarily bear interest at fixed rates  we do not believe we have material exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   we had no debt instruments on our balance sheet 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions on contracts with vendors associated outside of the united states 
accordingly changes in the value of the us dollar  relative to other currencies  may have an impact on our financial statements and earnings 
the number and dollar amount of contracts denominated in foreign currency is immaterial  therefore  we believe we do not have material exposure to foreign currency risk
