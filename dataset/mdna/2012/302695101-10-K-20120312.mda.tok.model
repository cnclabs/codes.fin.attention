item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
overview as discussed in item  business above  the majority of our operations are in poland  and we have devoted most of our technical talent and capital expenditures in the last several years to our operations in that country 
the decision to devote most of our available capital to this area drives our operating results and the changes to our balance sheet and liquidity 
our operations in poland  which are a combination of existing production and substantial exploration  have grown considerably 
oil and gas production  oil and gas revenues  cash flow  earnings  oil and gas reserves  and oil and gas expenditures in this area have grown significantly over the last three years 
our us operations also have an impact 
our us operations are smaller than those in poland and do not present the same level of opportunities for expansion  however  our us operations are a relatively stable source of cash flow 
this  too  is reflected in our operating results 
highlights over the past three years include oil and gas revenues have increased more than to million in  a compound annual growth rate of per year since total revenues have likewise increased  with a compound annual growth rate of per year during the same period 
oil and gas production has jumped to bcfe in proved reserve volumes have increased to a record bcfe at year end the pv value of our proved oil and gas reserves increased to million at year end our total liquidity and financial flexibility have improved substantially with our higher revenues along with the proceeds from an equity offering concluded in early notwithstanding our positive results  we continue to face challenges operating in a foreign country  economic system  and culture  including delays associated with the commencement of production from our ksk wells  which prevented higher revenue gains during  the pace at which pgnig  our operating partner in the fences concession  wishes to proceed or the extent to which pgnig wishes to participate as a non operating partner in other concessions  operating practices that differ from customary practices in the united states  which generally result in higher capital costs in poland  longer lead times to first production  and lower initial production rates  relatively less success in our exploration efforts outside of our core fences area  and volatile noncash adjustments for foreign currency fluctuations continuing to affect our net income in an unpredictable fashion 
there are two other factors that affect our results of operations that  though not unique to us  are a bit different from factors united states investors typically see in comparison with most domestic  small capitalization independent producers the different pricing model for our polish gas production  and the functional currency for our largest subsidiary  fx energy poland  which is the polish zloty  not the us dollar 
commodity prices global oil prices continued to be volatile in gas prices in the united states remained at depressed levels  which have persisted since however  the polish gas market operates quite differently than the us domestic market 
in poland  substantially all of our gas production is sold to pgnig and is tied to published tariffs wholesale prices set from time to time by the public utility regulator for gas sold to wholesale consumers 
during  the polish regulator reduced the low methane tariff  which is the basis for all of our gas contracts in poland  by in response to the global recession  however  the regulator increased the same tariff twice in  the first by and the second by 
in  prices were further increased by in august  and pgnig had a price increase request pending with the regulator in early a major component of the tariff calculation is the cost of russian imported gas  which is priced based predominantly on trailing oil prices 
thus  world oil prices can have a significant impact on polish gas prices 
other major components of the tariff calculation include the cost of gas provided by pgnig itself  as well as the necessity for pgnig to cover its internal cost structure 
natural gas prices in poland are  and for years have been  below european union average prices for both households and industry  because the prices have been subsidized by the government 
european union rules require poland to gradually abandon market subsidies and bring polish gas prices to free market levels 
poland continues to enjoy the strongest economy in the european union  and was the only country in europe to record positive gdp growth every year from through economists predict another positive year during these factors may act as cushions against possible declines in prices 
as of year end  gas prices in poland remained firm and were significantly higher than those of an equivalent btu content in the united states 
for example  as of the date of this report the price we receive for natural gas at our roszkow well  which has a methane content of  is approximately double the spot price under natural gas contracts for methane gas traded on the new york mercantile exchange  sometimes referred to as the henry hub price 
the volumes of our gas reserves in poland from through were not impacted by changing prices 
however  all of our oil and gas reserves can be price sensitive  and future material reductions in the prices at which we sell our oil and gas could result in the impairment of reserves 
functional currency and exchange rates the functional currency of our polish subsidiary is the polish zloty 
accounting standards require the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation 
because fx energy poland s functional currency is the polish zloty  translation adjustments result from the process of translating its financial statements into the us dollar reporting currency 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income  but are reported separately and accumulated in other comprehensive income 
the accounting basis of the assets and liabilities affected by the change is adjusted to reflect the difference between the exchange rate when the asset or liability was first recorded and the exchange rate on the date of the change 
the difference in functional currency also affects the amounts we report for our polish assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses from those that would be reported were the us dollar the functional currency for our polish operations 
the differences will depend on changes in period average and period end exchange rates 
transaction gains or losses may be significant given the volatility of the exchange rate 
we enter into various agreements in poland denominated in the polish zloty 
the exchange rate between the us dollar and the polish zloty is subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control 
during  the zloty fluctuated between a low of zlotys per us dollar to a high of zlotys per us dollar  a fluctuation of 
variations in exchange rates affect the us dollar denominated amount of revenue we report  compared to what we receive in polish zlotys 
as the us dollar strengthens relative to the zloty  our us dollar denominated revenue actually received in polish zlotys declines  conversely  when the us dollar weakens relative to the zloty  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys increases 
likewise  a weak us dollar leads to lower us dollar denominated drilling  capital  and exploration costs  while a strong us dollar has the opposite effect for the cost structure of our polish operations 
should exchange rates in effect during early continue throughout the year  we expect the exchange rates to have a slightly negative impact on our us dollar denominated revenues compared to in addition  the change in the exchange rate from the end of each reporting period to the next has an impact on foreign exchange gains and losses 
at the end of  the exchange rate was zlotys per us dollar compared to zlotys per us dollar at the end of this year end to year end devaluation of the zloty represents an increase in the amount of polish currency required to satisfy outstanding us dollar denominated intercompany and other loans of fx energy poland as of december   and creates the foreign exchange loss recorded on our consolidated statements of operations 
more information concerning the impact of foreign currency transactions can be found in the discussion that follows  as well as in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production  or e p  segment in poland and the united states  and the oilfield services segment in the united states 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
dd a  g a  amortization of deferred compensation  interest income  other income  interest expense  and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed fully following the segment discussion

exploration and production segment gas revenues 
revenues from gas sales were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
gas revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher gas prices  coupled with approximately million related to higher annual production 
our gas revenues increased from levels by approximately million due to higher gas prices  coupled with approximately million related to higher annual production 
company wide net gas production increased from a daily rate in of approximately mmcfd to a record rate of approximately mmcfd in in early january  gas was flowing in poland at an average rate of mmcfd  net to our interest 
in addition to our increased production  three factors resulted in higher gas revenues during first  the polish low methane tariff  which serves as the reference price for our gas sales agreements  averaged higher during the full year of compared to the increase was a function of a increase that became effective for us on august  second  period to period strength in the polish zloty against the us dollar increased our us dollar denominated gas prices 
the average exchange rate during was zlotys per us dollar 
the average exchange rate during was zlotys per us dollar  a change of approximately 
third  with the addition of production from our ksk wells  where we receive approximately of the low methane tariff  our weighted average price per thousand cubic feet of natural gas increased slightly 
we negotiate a separate gas sales agreement for each new field 
the primary driver of our increased production in was the commencement  in december  of production at our ksk wells 
while we experienced significant delays in the commencement of full production from these three wells due to an unresolved pipeline bottleneck  our ksk wells still produced a combined total of  mmcf net to our interest  resulting in incremental revenues during of approximately million 
we expect production from our ksk wells to generate significant increases in both revenues and net production during we expect full resolution of the pipeline bottleneck during the second quarter of  following which the following which the ksk wells are expected to be producing at a combined rate of mmcfd mmcfd net to our interest 
we receive of the low methane tariff  adjusted for energy content  for our ksk production 
gas production at our roszkow well averaged mmcfd during  taking into consideration a two week production cessation for annual maintenance 
at year end  the well was producing at a rate of mmcfd 
gas at roszkow is being sold to pgnig at a contracted rate equal to of the published low methane tariff 
gas production at our zaniemysl well averaged mmcfd during  taking into consideration a two week production cessation for annual maintenance 
at year end  the well was producing at a rate of mmcfd 
gas at zaniemysl is being sold to pgnig at a contracted rate equal to of the published low methane tariff 
we expect production facilities to be complete  and gas to start flowing  at our winna gora well early in the third quarter of production from that well is expected to begin at a rate of approximately mmcfd mmcfd net to our interest 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for gas revenues  average gas prices  gas production volumes  and lifting costs per mcf for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per mcf percent change versus prior year production volumes mcf percent change versus prior year lifting costs per mcf percent change versus prior year lifting costs per mcf are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total volume of gas produced 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
higher average oil prices in compared to was the cause for the increase in revenues 
our average oil price during was per barrel  a increase compared to per barrel received during production from our us properties declined by due to normal production declines 
included in oil revenues were approximately  related to the sale of oil at our wilga well in poland for the year ended december  all other oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
us oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately million related to production declines 
us oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately million related to production declines 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil revenues  average oil prices  oil production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per bbl percent change versus prior year production volumes bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
light crude oil lifting costs in poland are based on an allocation of total costs based on relative revenues between oil and gas 
lifting costs include production taxes incurred in the united states 
costs in include approximately million associated with the cleanup of a minor oil leak 
excluding the cleanup costs  lifting costs per barrel in would have equaled approximately per barrel 
lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in  million in  and million in operating costs in the united states increased in by approximately million over costs  due to million spent to remediate a small oil leak in montana along with higher workover costs on our existing producing wells 
operating costs in poland decreased slightly in from levels 
most operating costs in poland arise from fixed costs at our production facilities  variations in production do not usually result in cost variations 
the decrease in resulted from a reduction in costs associated with our wilga and kleka wells  neither of which produced in exploration costs 
exploration expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs as well as the costs of exploratory dry holes 
exploration costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in was a function of increased funds available for exploration activities following our equity offering in march 
geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during all three years  most of our g g costs were spent on acquiring  processing  and interpreting new d and d seismic data in the fences area and in our other concession areas in poland 
exploratory dry hole costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our dry hole costs were associated with our machnatka well 
under the terms of a joint operating agreement  our partner agreed to pay of the costs of the well to a depth of  meters 
after reaching that depth  the partners agreed to continue drilling to a depth of approximately  meters 
our share of the dry hole costs is equal to of the incremental drilling costs incurred drilling the additional meters 
during  recompletion attempts failed to establish commercial production at our zakowo project in poland 
during  we drilled one dry hole in nevada 
impairment costs 
impairments of oil and gas properties were  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we dropped a small amount of non prospective acreage near our kutno project and impaired the associated undeveloped leasehold costs 
as discussed previously  production at our kleka and wilga wells ceased during and  respectively  and we impaired their remaining capital costs 
asset retirement obligation 
we recorded gains associated with future asset retirement obligations of  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
when the present value of a future asset retirement obligation changes due to the increase or decrease of the estimated plugging costs of that asset  we adjust the related asset retirement cost 
during all three years  the economic lives of our united states oil wells were increased  as higher oil prices resulted in more economic barrels 
this change resulted in a decrease in the net present value of the retirement obligations  which in turn resulted in gains associated with those obligations  as the related asset retirement costs had been previously written off due to property impairments 
dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily a function of our increased production in poland 
the increase from to is primarily related to a downward reserve revision at our roszkow well  which is discussed below 
future dd a costs are expected to generally  but not completely  follow future production trends 
however  future dd a rates can be very different depending upon future capitalized costs and changes in reserve volumes 
accretion expense 
accretion expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accretion expense is related entirely to our asset retirement obligation associated with expected future plugging and abandonment costs 
oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we drilled eight wells for third parties  including those drilled for our alberta bakken joint venture  during  along with additional well service work 
we drilled wells for third parties during  however  most of these were shallow wells  which can be drilled in only two to three days and generate less revenue per well than deeper wells 
we also drilled similar wells for third parties during  along with additional well service work 
oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
we cannot accurately predict future oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  or   and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
the increases from to and again from to were primarily due to the nature of our drilling activity discussed above 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are closely associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we spent million  million  and million on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during   and  respectively 
these capital additions resulted in higher dd a expenses for this segment during and nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our g a costs rose from levels primarily due to higher legal and investor relations related costs 
our g a costs rose from levels primarily due to higher compensation and consulting costs 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock and stock options granted to employees in    and stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in    and stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in    and interest and other income expense corporate 
interest and other income expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we incurred million in interest expense  which included million of amortization of loan fees and million in unused commitment fees 
interest and other income was million during included in the amount was interest income of approximately  offset by a charge of approximately  associated with the impairment of some obsolete inventory in the united states 
during  we incurred million in interest expense  which included million of previously unamortized loan fees associated with our prior credit facility  million of amortization of loan fees and million in unused commitment fees 
interest and other income was  during included in the amount was a gain of approximately million attributable to the sale of tubing associated with our grundy well  which was drilled and abandoned during during  we amortized million related to fees incurred in securing our senior credit facility which was charged to interest expense 
we also paid million in interest on outstanding borrowings 
these interest related costs were offset by interest income of million 
foreign exchange 
we incurred foreign exchange losses of million  million  and gains of million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
included in were million related to mark to market and settlement adjustments to polish zloty forward contracts 
there were no such contracts in and income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accounting standards require that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
proved reserves oil and gas reserves reserve volumes increased year end due primarily to the addition of the lisewo well  which was completed early in the year 
positive reserve revisions  due to higher oil prices in the united states and to more favorable technical data in poland  partially offset our record gas production 
higher average oil and gas prices used to calculate year end reserve values increased our estimated pv values 
the following table highlights year end reserve volumes and values and shows the change from to change in thousands proved reserve volumes gas reserves mcf oil reserves bbls total reserves mcfe proved reserve values reserves pv value changes in proved reserves were as follows mmcfe proved reserves beginning of year extensions  discoveries  and other additions revisions of previous estimates production proved reserves end of year extensions  discoveries  and other additions 
all of the additions to proved reserves that result from the discovery of new fields are associated with our lisewo well  which was completed for production during early revisions 
revisions represent changes in previous reserves estimates  either upward or downward  resulting from new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in economic factors  such as commodity prices  operating costs  or development costs 
apart from a reduction due to annual production  we recorded upward reserve revisions at our roszkow and winna gora wells  which were offset by small downward revisions at our zaniemysl and ksk wells 
at roszkow  new pressure data indicates that the initial gas in place may be more than estimated at year end we also recorded upward revisions of approximately  barrels of oil in the united states  primarily due to higher oil prices resulting in more economically recoverable barrels 
revisions at year end included downward revisions in poland due to interpretations of reservoir pressure data at our roszkow well  while upward revisions occurred in the united states due to higher oil prices 
revisions at year end included upward oil revisions due to higher crude oil prices  offset by downward gas revisions due to the cessation of production at our wilga well 
we have historically added reserves through our exploration and development activities see items and  business and properties 
production 
see gas revenues and oil revenues above 
operational trends we currently expect that our production will rise significantly from our production rates with the achievement of full production at our three ksk wells and the commencement of production at our winna gora well 
we expect full resolution of the pipeline bottleneck during the second quarter of  at which time the kskwells are expected to be producing at a rate of mmcfd mmcfd net to our interest 
we will receive of the published low methane tariff  adjusted for energy content  for our ksk production 
we expect production facilities to be complete  and gas to start flowing  at our winna gora well in the third quarter of production from that well is expected to begin at a rate of approximately mmcfd mmcfd net to our interest 
as of early  we had not yet concluded a gas sales agreement for our winna gora well  but we expect the price we receive to be approximately equal to that of our ksk wells 
the amount of revenue from this increased production will depend on applicable gas sales prices and prevailing currency exchange rates 
future oil revenues from our domestic production will depend on the impact of prices we receive as we continue to experience normal production declines 
we cannot accurately predict future oilfield services revenues and related costs  which will continue to fluctuate based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the nature and extent of any equipment upgrading  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
costs that vary in concert with production  such as lease operating expenses and dd a costs  will trend up or down with production increases or decreases 
our plans for capital expenditures are detailed in the following section  liquidity and capital resources our capital resources and future expenditures 
our us dollar denominated financial results will continue to be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations  which cannot be predicted 
liquidity and capital resources for much of our history  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  bank borrowings  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
however  as our oil and gas production has increased in poland in the last several years and as higher oil prices have improved the profitability of our us production  our internally generated cash flow has become a significant source of operations financing 
liquidity and capital working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   an increase of million from december  our current assets at year end included approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in accrued oil and gas sales from both the united states and poland  and million in receivables from our joint interest partners in both the united states and poland that were collected in early in poland  approximately million was due at year end from pgnig primarily related to the drilling of our kutno well  where we act at the operator 
our joint interest receivables in the united states are primarily related to our alberta bakken project 
our current liabilities at year end included approximately million payable by fx poland for kutno drilling and other costs associated with our operations in poland that were paid in early operating activities 
net cash used in operations during was million 
net cash provided by operating activities during was million 
we used net cash of million in our operating activities during a million increase in exploration costs in offset higher revenues  leading to a decline in cash provided from operating activities in investing activities 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which were related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we spent million adding to our oilfield services equipment 
we also benefited from approximately million spent in the warsaw south project area by pgnig for seismic and drilling costs in in order to earn a interest in the concession 
in  we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which were related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent million adding to our oilfield services equipment 
in  we received million from the maturities of marketable securities and invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which were related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and million adding to our oilfield services equipment 
financing activities 
our cash flow from financing activities was and million  during and  respectively 
we used net cash in financing activities of million during during  we issued million shares of common stock in a registered public offering  which resulted in net proceeds to us  after offering costs  of approximately million 
we used million of those proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility at the time of the offering 
we borrowed million under our credit facility in the fourth quarter of we also received proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
during  we borrowed million under our expanded credit facility  using million to repay our credit facility and million in fees associated with the expanded credit facility 
in addition  we sold million shares of stock in a registered direct offering  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
option holders exercised options to purchase  shares of common stock  resulting in proceeds to us of an additional million 
during  we paid million towards a loan related to auction rate securities 
in addition  options and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were exercised during the year  resulting in proceeds to us of  our capital resources and future expenditures our anticipated sources of liquidity and capital for include our working capital of million at year end  available credit of million under our expanded credit facility when we meet the benchmarks discussed below  and cash available from our operations 
in august  we refinanced our existing credit facility by executing an expanded credit facility with the royal bank of scotland plc  ing bank nv  and kbc bank nv 
the expanded credit facility calls for a periodic interest rate of libor plus and has a term of five years  with semiannual borrowing base reductions of million each beginning on june  the expanded credit facility is an interest only facility until june we have access to million under the expanded credit facility until our kromolice  sroda  and kromolice wells have been on simultaneous production for days  at which time the full million becomes available 
in late  we drew million under this facility 
although all three banks that participate in our credit facility successfully passed the required european bank stress tests  in view of the unsettled circumstances surrounding the secondary credit crisis in europe  signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in europe  and the uncertain success of efforts to resolve the euro crisis  we felt it prudent to access these funds to ensure their availability to finance our future capital programs 
our access to the remaining million under our credit facility  when it becomes available  may be adversely affected by the capital stability of our lenders and european credit and economic conditions generally 
production remains stable at our roszkow  zaniemysl  and kromolice wells in poland 
as discussed earlier  production resumed at our sroda well in early  and we expect production to commence from our kromolice well during the second quarter of further  production should begin in the third quarter at our winna gora well 
along with our oil production in the united states  we expect to see another increase in oil and gas revenues in we have an effective universal shelf registration statement under the securities act under which we may sell up to million of equity or debt securities of various kinds 
in december  we entered into an agreement to possibly sell up to million in common stock during the next two years in at the market transactions 
through the date of this filing  we have not sold any stock under that agreement 
in march  we sold million shares of stock for million  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
assuming all million of common stock covered by the at the market facility were sold  the remaining million balance of securities available for sale under the registration statement is available for sale at any time  subject to market conditions and our ability to access the capital markets  to further finance our exploration and development plans in poland and for other corporate purposes 
at year end  we were in the process of drilling the kutno well  having incurred a total cost of million during the year 
our total costs for this well once drilling is completed are expected to be in the million range 
we have agreed with pgnig to conduct a fracture stimulation test at the plawce well early in the second quarter of we were also in the process of building production facilities at our winna gora well 
we had no other firm commitments for future capital and exploration costs at year end 
we expect our primary use of cash for will be for our exploration and development activities in poland and the united states 
we expect the cost of these activities to range from million to million for d and d seismic data acquisition and analysis  production facilities for existing discoveries  and additional exploration and development drilling 
the actual amount of our expenditures will depend on ongoing exploration results  the pace at which pgnig  our operating partner in the fences project area  wishes to proceed or the extent it wishes to continue to participate with us in concessions we operate  the availability of drilling and other exploration resources  and the amount of capital we obtain from the various sources discussed above 
our various sources of liquidity and capital outlined above should more than enable us to meet our capital needs in poland and the united states for the next months 
we have the ability to control the timing and amount of most of our future capital and exploration costs 
we may continue to incur operating losses in future periods  and we continue to fund substantial exploration and development in poland 
we have a history of operating losses 
from our inception in january through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
despite our recent and expected future increases in production and revenues  our exploration and production activities may continue to result in net losses in future years  depending on the success of our drilling activities in poland and the united states and whether we generate sufficient revenues to cover related operating expenses 
we may also seek to obtain additional funds for future capital investments from the sale of partial property interests or arrangements such as those recently negotiated for our kutno and warsaw south project areas in which industry participants are bearing the initial exploration costs to earn an interest in the project or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we will allocate our existing capital  as well as funds we may obtain in the future  among our various projects at our discretion 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition  and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments contractual obligations 
at december   the aggregate amounts of our contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows total in thousands credit facility interest payments on long term debt total under the terms of our million credit facility  the amount of credit available is reduced by million each six months  beginning on june  as of december   we had borrowed million under the facility  and the reduction of that amount is illustrated in the table above 
during the ordinary course of business in poland  we enter into agreements for the drilling of wells  the construction of production facilities  and for seismic projects 
these are typically short term agreements and are completed in less than one year 
we are subject to certain work commitments respecting our owned exploration concessions that must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
these work commitments are optional on our part  however  they must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
we can request changes to usufruct and concession agreements that either modify the obligations to reduce our commitments or extend the terms of those agreements 
in addition  we routinely relinquish acreage that we believe has lower potential rather than continue to be subject to the related work commitment 
our exploration budget and related activities are focused on exploration and long term exploitation of our most promising exploration opportunities and are not specifically or primarily focused on meeting these work commitments 
our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage  suspension of operations  personal injury  and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states and poland operations and also rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration partners in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling  and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
asset retirement obligation 
we have liabilities of million related to asset retirement obligations on our consolidated balance sheet at december   excluded from the table above 
due to the nature of these obligations  we cannot determine precisely when the payments will be made to settle these obligations 
new accounting pronouncements recent securities and exchange commission rule making activity in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended standards that eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity and require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income as either one continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the amended standards do not affect the reported amounts of comprehensive income 
in december   the fasb deferred the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement that had previously been included in the june amended standard 
these amended standards are to be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted these standards on january  in may  the fasb issued amended standards to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosures between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the standards include amendments that clarify the intent behind the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosures and other amendments that change principles or requirements for fair value measurements or disclosures 
the amended standards are to be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted these standards on january  in january  the fasb issued new standards intended to improve disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new standards require details of transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the gross presentation of activity within the level fair value measurement roll forward 
the new disclosures are required of all entities that are required to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
we adopted these new rules effective january   except for the gross presentation of the level fair value measurement roll forward  which we adopted december  in all cases referenced above  the adoption of the new rules or standards did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that net capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not considered to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
gains and losses are recognized on sales of entire interests in proved and unproved properties 
sales of partial interests are generally treated as a recovery of costs and any resulting gain or loss is recorded as other income 
revenues associated with oil and gas sales are recorded when title passes  which is upon delivery to the pipeline or purchaser  and are net of royalties 
oilfield service revenues are recognized when the related service is performed 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
oil and gas reserves all of the reserves data in this form k are estimates 
estimates of our crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by our engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission  including the recent rule revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements  which we adopted effective december  reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserves estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  economic producibility of reserves is dependent on the oil and gas prices used in the reserves estimate 
we based our december   reserves estimates on a month average commodity price  unless contractual arrangements designated the price to be used  in accordance with securities and exchange commission rules 
however  oil and gas prices are volatile and  as a result  our reserves estimates will change in the future 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect our dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also cause us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge  which would reduce earnings
