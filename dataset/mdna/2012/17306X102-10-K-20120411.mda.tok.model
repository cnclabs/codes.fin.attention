item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial and operating data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the respective related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a value priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories for the entire family 
our merchandise offerings are designed to appeal to the preferences of fashion conscious consumers  particularly african americans 
we operate stores in both urban and rural markets in states 
prior to encountering a challenging sales environment  we were pursuing an aggressive store growth strategy that included opening new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal we expect to take a more conservative approach to growth in fiscal with plans to open approximately new stores 
we will continue to evaluate our growth strategy as we monitor operating results in fiscal we measure performance using key operating statistics 
one of the main performance measures we use is comparable store sales growth 
we define a comparable store as a store that has been opened for an entire fiscal year 
therefore  a store will not be considered a comparable store until its th month of operation at the earliest or until its th month at the latest 
as an example  stores opened in fiscal and fiscal were not considered comparable stores in fiscal relocated and expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales results 
we also use other operating statistics  most notably average sales per store  to measure our performance 
as we typically occupy existing space in established shopping centers rather than sites built specifically for our stores  store square footage and therefore sales per square foot varies by store 
we focus on overall store sales volume as the critical driver of profitability 
the average sales per store has increased over the years  as we have increased comparable store sales and opened new stores that are generally larger than our historical store base 
average sales per store have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in addition to sales  we measure gross profit as a percentage of sales and store operating expenses  with a particular focus on labor  as a percentage of sales 
these results translate into store level contribution  which we use to evaluate overall performance of each individual store 
finally  we monitor corporate expenses against budgeted amounts 
all of the statistics discussed above are critical components of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda comprised of ebitda plus non cash asset impairment expense  which are considered our most important operating statistics 
although ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information on an operating cash flow basis  they are limited measures in that they exclude the impact of cash requirements for capital expenditures  income taxes and interest expense 
therefore  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be used as supplements to results of operations and cash flows as reported under gaap and should not be used as a singular measure of operating performance or as a substitute for gaap results 
provided below is a reconciliation of net loss income to ebitda and to adjusted ebitda for fiscal years ended january   january  and january  
table of contents fiscal year ended january  january  january  net loss income plus interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization less interest income income tax benefit ebitda asset impairment adjusted ebitda basis of the presentation net sales consist of store sales and layaway fees  net of returns by customers 
cost of sales consists of the cost of products we sell and associated freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of store costs  including payroll and occupancy costs  corporate and distribution center costs and advertising costs 
we operate on a or week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday closest to january each of our fiscal quarters consists of four week periods  with an extra week added to the fourth quarter every five to six years 
the years ended january   january   january   january   and february  are referred to as fiscal    and  respectively 
each of these five fiscal years is comprised of weeks 
fiscal will be a week year ending on february  based on historical sales results in late january and early february  the rd week is expected to reflect sales that are higher than our annual weekly average  however  incremental profits for such week may be negligible because that week has historically had high levels of markdowns 
results of operations the following discussion of our financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth in the financial pages of this report 
the nature of our business is seasonal 
historically  sales in the first and fourth quarters have been higher than sales achieved in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
expenses and  to a greater extent  operating income  vary by quarter 
results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year 
furthermore  the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods 

table of contents net sales and additional operating data the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated statement of operations data expressed both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  january  january  dollars in thousands statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization asset impairment loss income from operations interest income interest expense loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income the following table provides information  for the years indicated  about the number of total stores open at the beginning of the year  stores opened and closed during each year  total stores open at the end of each year and comparable store sales for the years fiscal year ended january  january  january  total stores open  beginning of year new stores closed stores total stores open  end of year comparable store sales decrease increase stores included in the comparable store sales calculation for any year are those stores that were opened prior to the beginning of the preceding fiscal year and were still open at the end of such year 
relocated stores and expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales results 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was due primarily to new store openings in fiscal and new store openings in fiscal for which there was not a full year of sales in fiscal  partially offset by an decrease in comparable store sales and the closing of five stores in fiscal and two stores in fiscal the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase in sales and the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase  while the sales decrease in the comparable stores totaled million and the closed stores had the effect of reducing sales by million 
comparable stores include locations that have been relocated or expanded 
there were stores relocated or expanded in fiscal and stores relocated or expanded in fiscal sales in these comparable relocated and expanded stores increased in fiscal  while sales in all other comparable stores decreased 
the overall decrease in comparable store sales was reflected primarily in a decline in customer transactions  with the remainder being due to a lower average customer purchase 
sales were impacted by a challenging economic environment for our core customer  stiff price competition and a fashion cycle where many of the urban brands that have historically been strong performers for us fell out of favor 
in addition  we believe we did not react to these challenges as well or as quickly as we could have 
ultimately  we commenced a process of reducing our prices and rebalancing our merchandise mix more towards non branded merchandise in order to better serve our customers 
while we started to see an improvement in customer traffic late in the year  albeit at a lower average ticket  it was not enough to turn comparable store sales positive 
comparable store sales changes by major merchandise class were as follows home  accessories  children s  women s and men s 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is the result of a decline in the gross margin to in fiscal from in fiscal  partially offset by the effect of the increase in total sales discussed above 
the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a decline in the core merchandise margin initial mark up  net of markdowns of basis points  resulting from the need to reduce prices for competitive reasons and to take clearance markdowns necessitated by the negative comparable store sales  particularly in the very slow moving branded categories 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was due primarily to additional store level  distribution and corporate costs arising from the opening of new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to the deleveraging effect on expenses as a percentage of sales when comparable store sales decline 
in particular  rent  utilities and other occupancy expenses  which tend to be highly fixed in nature  increased basis points as a percentage of sales  and payroll expenses  which have a sizable fixed component associated with store management and corporate overhead  increased basis points as a percentage of sales 
almost of the remaining basis points of increase related to million of severance expense  incurred in connection with the elimination of positions in our corporate office  distribution centers and store organization and the departure of two executives 
in addition  there was deleverage in the expense ratio of basis points million related to expenses incurred to close the savannah  georgia distribution center and basis points spread over numerous other categories of expense as a result of the comparable store sales deleverage described above 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as a result of capital expenditures incurred in opening the new distribution center in roland  oklahoma and for stores that are new or were relocated  expanded  or converted to the new citi lights format 
asset impairment 
impairment charges for property and equipment at certain underperforming stores totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was a result of the decline in sales and gross margin as discussed above 
in addition  goodwill of million was fully impaired in due to a decrease in the company s stock price 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was million in fiscal  while income tax expense was million in fiscal  with the change due to having a pretax loss this year and pretax income last year 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared with in fiscal because income tax credits have the effect of increasing income tax benefit and decreasing income tax expense 
the benefit s effective rate in would have been even higher from such credits if not for a million charge related to the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain state tax credits that are no longer more likely than not to be utilized 
net loss income 
net loss was million in fiscal  while net income was million in fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was due primarily to new store openings in fiscal and new store openings in fiscal for which there was not a full year of sales in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales and the closing of two stores in fiscal and three stores in fiscal the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase in sales and the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase  while the sales decrease in the comparable stores totaled million and the closed stores had the effect of reducing sales by million 
comparable stores include locations that have been relocated or expanded 
there were stores relocated or expanded in fiscal and stores relocated or expanded in fiscal sales in these comparable relocated and expanded stores increased in fiscal  while sales in all other comparable stores decreased 
the overall decrease in comparable store sales was reflected in a reduction in the average customer purchase  partially offset by a slight increase in the number of customer transactions 
comparable store sales changes by major merchandise class were as follows accessories  home  men s  children s  and women s 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is a result of the increase in sales  partially offset by a slight decline in the gross margin to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was due primarily to additional store level  distribution and corporate costs arising from the opening of new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in comparable store sales pressured expenses as a percentage of sales due to the deleveraging effect on fixed expenses  particularly rent and other occupancy costs 
however  the extent of the expense deleverage was limited to basis points through tight control of costs in light of the sales environment and because incentive compensation as a percentage of sales was basis points less in due to missing profitability and sales targets used to compute such compensation 
as a result  the increase in expenses was less than the increase in store selling square footage 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as the result of capital expenditures incurred for new and relocated expanded stores 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher pretax earnings in fiscal and an increase in the effective income tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the tax rate was due to having less tax free interest income in fiscal net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital and for capital expenditures for our stores  distribution infrastructure and information systems 
historically  we have met these cash requirements from cash flow from operations  short term trade credit  borrowings under our revolving lines of credit  long term debt and capital leases  and cash proceeds from our initial public offering 
we expect to be able to meet future cash requirements with cash flow from operations  short term trade credit  existing cash balances and  if necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility described below 
in fiscal  there was no need to borrow under the credit facility  including during the seasonal build of inventory in advance of the christmas season 
due to our strong cash and cash equivalents position as of january  million  we believe that we will likely not have to borrow under the credit facility during fiscal cash flows fiscal compared to fiscal as of january   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  compared with million as of january  the most significant factors in the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents position during fiscal were capital expenditures and purchases of investment securities  partially offset by positive cash flow from operating activities 
inventory represented of our total assets as of january   compared with as of january  management s ability to manage our inventory can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given interim period or fiscal 
table of contents year 
in addition  inventory purchases can be seasonal in nature  such as the purchase of warm weather or christmas related merchandise 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal net loss  adjusted for noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  asset impairment  deferred income taxes  loss on disposal of property and equipment  and stock based compensation expense  provided cash of million compared with million in fiscal from net income  adjusted for noncash expenses 
other significant sources of cash provided by operating activities included an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other long term liabilities  and accrued compensation 
accounts payable increased million compared with million in fiscal 
the increase in accounts payable was due to an increase in inventory and as a result of inventory at the end of fiscal including a higher than normal level of opportunistic purchases of next season buy merchandise made in the second half of in an effort to lock in costs in advance of anticipated merchandise cost inflation 
many of the payments to trade vendors for the higher level of next season buys had been made prior to the end of the year  therefore  accounts payable was lower as a percentage of inventory at the end of fiscal than fiscal accrued expenses and other long term liabilities increased million compared with million in fiscal due primarily to the company s store growth and our increasing tendency to take responsibility for the leasehold improvements in new stores in return for tenant improvement reimbursements from landlords 
accrued compensation increased million compared with a decrease of million in fiscal as a result of severance accruals for two former officers and for employees laid off in connection with a reduction in force 
significant uses of cash included income tax receivable increased million compared with million in fiscal due to a pretax loss in fiscal  including losses incurred after first quarter estimated tax payments had already been made  and inventory increased million compared with million in fiscal due primarily to the growth in new stores 
the new store inventory was partially offset by a million reduction in next season buy merchandise  as discussed above 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal cash used for the purchase of property and equipment was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  including capital expenditures for new stores in fiscal and new stores in capital expenditures related to the new distribution center in roland  oklahoma totaled million in fiscal and million in purchases of investment securities  net of sales redemptions  used cash of million in fiscal sales redemptions of investment securities  net of purchases  provided cash of million in fiscal cash flows used in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was insignificant in both fiscal and until required for other purposes  we maintain cash and cash equivalents in deposit or money market accounts 
fiscal compared to fiscal as of january   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  compared with million as of january  the most significant factors in the increase in our cash and cash equivalents position during fiscal were positive cash flow from operating activities and sales redemptions of investment securities  partially offset by capital expenditures and purchases of investment securities 
inventory represented of our total assets as of january   compared with as of january  management s ability to manage our inventory can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given interim period or fiscal year 
in addition  inventory purchases can be seasonal in nature  such as the purchase of warm weather or christmas related merchandise 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the main source of cash during fiscal was net income  adjusted for noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  asset impairment  deferred income taxes  loss on disposal of property and equipment  and stock based compensation expense  totaling million compared with million in fiscal 
in addition  cash provided by operating activities benefited from accounts payable increasing million compared with million in fiscal due to an increase in inventory 
the increase in accounts payable was not as high as would typically be expected on an inventory increase of million  because much of the increase in inventory was due to more opportunistic purchases of next season buy merchandise in the second half of in an effort to lock in costs in advance of anticipated merchandise cost inflation 
many of the payments to trade vendors for the higher level of next season buys had been made prior to the end of the year  therefore  accounts payable was lower as a percentage of inventory at the end of fiscal than fiscal significant uses of cash included inventory which increased million compared with million in fiscal due to the growth in new stores and the efforts to make more opportunistic purchases of next season buy merchandise  as discussed above  and a shift from an income tax payable to an income tax receivable totaling million compared with an increase in the income tax payable in fiscal of million 
the existence of an income tax receivable at the end of fiscal compared with a payable at the end of fiscal was due to a decrease in year over year pretax income in the fourth quarter 
since estimated tax payments for the first three quarters of fiscal had assumed 
table of contents continued growth in profitability in the fourth quarter  a receivable existed at year end equal to the estimated payments in excess of the income tax expense recorded for financial statement purposes 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal cash used for the purchase of property and equipment was million during fiscal and million in fiscal  with fiscal including capital expenditures for more new stores vs 
and million related to the purchase and equipping of the new distribution center in roland  oklahoma 
sales redemptions of investment securities  net of purchases  provided cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash flows used in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was insignificant in both fiscal and fiscal liquidity sources and requirements and contractual cash requirements and commitments our principal sources of liquidity consist of i cash and cash equivalents which equaled million as of january   ii short term trade credit  iii cash generated from operations on an ongoing basis as we sell our merchandise inventory  and iv a million revolving credit facility 
trade credit represents a significant source of financing for inventory purchases and arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors 
historically  our principal liquidity requirements have been for working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately million to million in fiscal  including amounts related to approximately new stores that we plan to open in fiscal we plan to finance these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of january  and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations represents fixed minimum rents in stores and does not include incremental rents which are computed as a percentage of net sales 
for example  in fiscal incremental percentage rent was approximately million  which represented of total rent expense 
indebtedness 
on october   we entered into a new  five year  million credit facility with bank of america to replace our prior million credit facility 
the new facility includes a million uncommitted accordion feature that under certain circumstances could allow us to increase the size of the facility to million 
borrowings  if any  under the new facility will bear interest a for libor rate loans  at libor plus  or b for base rate loans  at a rate equal to the highest of i the prime rate plus  ii the federal funds rate plus  or iii libor plus 
the new facility is secured by our inventory  accounts receivable and related assets  but not our real estate  fixtures and equipment  and it contains one financial covenant  a fixed charge coverage ratio  which is applicable and tested only in certain circumstances 
the facility has an unused commitment fee of and permits the payment of cash dividends subject to certain limitations 
we have had no borrowings under either the new or prior facility 
operating leases 
we lease our stores under operating leases  which generally have an initial term of five years with renewal options 
the typical store lease requires a combination of both fixed monthly rents and contingent rents computed as a percentage of net sales after a certain sales threshold has been met 
for fiscal  rent expense was million compared with million in fiscal including million and million of percentage rent  respectively  in fiscal and 

table of contents purchase obligations 
as of january   we had purchase obligations of million  all of which were for less than one year 
these purchase obligations consist of outstanding merchandise orders 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the store operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
outstanding stock options as of january   we had outstanding vested options to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
there were no unvested options to purchase shares of common stock as of january  based on the closing price of our common stock of per share on january   the intrinsic value of the options outstanding on january  was  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market as determined by the retail inventory method for store inventory and the average cost method for distribution center inventory 
under the retail inventory method  the cost of inventory is determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory 
inherent in the retail inventory calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
merchandise markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is lowered in the stores 
as a result  we believe the retail inventory method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods 
we estimate and record an allowance for shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate of shrinkage can be affected by changes in actual shrinkage trends 
inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales has ranged from to during fiscal years through the allowance for estimated inventory shrinkage was million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions  which ultimately affect the value of the inventory 
we do not generally enter into such arrangements with our vendors 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal property and equipment  net we have a significant investment in property and equipment stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives primarily three to five years for computer equipment and furniture  fixtures and equipment  five years for leasehold improvements  seven years for major purchased software systems  and fifteen to twenty years for buildings and building improvements of the related assets or the relevant lease term 
any reduction in these estimated useful lives would result in a higher annual depreciation expense for the related assets 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss for long lived assets 
if facts and circumstances indicate that a long lived asset may be impaired  the carrying value is reviewed 
if this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
non cash impairment losses related to leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment at underperforming stores totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
there were no changes in our impairment loss methodology in fiscal  however  impairment losses were significantly higher in the year due to changes in estimates of future store cash flows resulting from declining comparable store sales and gross margin 
as of january  there are an additional stores with asset carrying values totaling million that will require close monitoring in the future 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends on a localized  regional  or national basis  and 
table of contents thus could be significantly different from historical results 
to the extent our estimates for net sales  gross profit and store expenses are not realized  future assessments of recoverability could result in impairment charges 
insurance liabilities we are largely self insured for workers compensation costs and employee medical claims 
our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims 
we use current and historical claims data  together with information from actuarial studies  in developing our estimates 
the insurance liabilities we record are primarily influenced by the frequency and severity of claims and the company s growth 
if the underlying facts and circumstances related to the claims change  then we may be required to record more or less expense which could be material in relation to our results of operations 
our self insurance liabilities totaled million million current and million noncurrent as of january  and million million current and million noncurrent as of january  there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to insurance liabilities during fiscal operating leases we lease all of our store properties and account for the leases as operating leases 
many lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
for purposes of recognizing incentives and minimum rent expense on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation of intended use 
for scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing rent holidays at a date other than the date of initial occupancy  we record minimum rent expense on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
tenant improvement allowances are included in accrued expenses current portion and other long term liabilities noncurrent portion and are amortized over the lease term 
changes in the balances of tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception 
these contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of net sales that are in excess of a predetermined level 
these amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to operating leases during fiscal accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
the computation of income taxes is subject to estimation due to the judgment required and the uncertainty related to the recoverability of deferred tax assets or the outcome of tax audits 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period it is determined that actual results will differ from our estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the year in which such changes are enacted 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to income taxes during fiscal  except that losses incurred in fiscal caused us to conclude that our future ability to utilize certain tax credits in one state was no longer more likely than not  necessitating a charge to income tax expense and a reduction in deferred tax assets of million in connection with the establishment of a valuation allowance 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for recently issued accounting standards  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks related to changes in interest rates earned on our investments 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates 
as a result  future results may differ materially from estimated results due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for fiscal we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes and have not entered into any interest rate hedging contracts 
interest rates on our credit facility did not impact us in fiscal because we did not borrow during the year 
we source all of our product from apparel markets in the united states in us dollars and  therefore  are not directly subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our purchasing power with vendors that import merchandise to sell to us 
we have not entered into forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices
