the company generally finances real estate with operating leases 
management believes its cash  cash equivalents  future cash flow from operations  and the company s current revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund these requirements 
as of january   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions 
because we plan to permanently reinvest our foreign earnings  in accordance with us gaap  we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
depending on the source  amount  and timing of a repatriation  some tax may be payable 
the company believes that its cash invested domestically  future domestic cash flows  and its current revolving credit agreement are sufficient to satisfy domestic requirements 

table of contents the company may also from time to time repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
on february   the company s board of directors approved a new year  million share repurchase program extending through january  replacing the previous million program 
any material adverse change in customer demand  fashion trends  competitive market forces  or customer acceptance of the company s merchandise mix and retail locations  uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing  the company s reliance on a few key vendors for a significant portion of its merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing  economic conditions worldwide  the effects of currency fluctuations  as well as other factors listed under the heading disclosure regarding forward looking statements  could affect the ability of the company to continue to fund its needs from business operations 
maintaining access to merchandise that the company considers appropriate for its business may be subject to the policies and practices of its key vendors 
therefore  the company believes that it is critical to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships with its key vendors

the company has the ability to revise and reschedule much of the anticipated capital expenditure program  should the company s financial position require it 
free cash flow non gaap measure in addition to net cash provided by operating activities  the company uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash 
the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity 
the company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the company s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management 
free cash flow is not defined under us gaap 
therefore  it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures
