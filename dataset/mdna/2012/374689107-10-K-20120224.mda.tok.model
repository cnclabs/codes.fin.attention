we serve customers throughout north america and europe including major home improvement retailers  distributors  and contractors 
as of december   we operated facilities in states  canada  england  and germany  giving us a broad platform for just in time delivery and support to our customers 
our strategy is to position gibraltar as the low cost provider and market share leader in product areas that offer the opportunity for sales growth and margin enhancement over the long term 
we focus on operational excellence including lean initiatives throughout the company to position gibraltar as our customers low cost provider of the products we offer 
we continuously seek to improve our on time delivery  quality  and service to position gibraltar as a preferred supplier to our customers 
during the past few years  gibraltar invested in new enterprise resource planning erp systems which  among other things  have enabled us to more effectively manage our inventory  forecast customer orders  enable efficient supply chain management  and respond to volatile raw material costs 
at the same time  we have significantly reduced our working capital levels while maintaining a high level of customer service 
we strive to develop and launch new products  expand our geographic market coverage  and penetrate new end markets to strengthen our product leadership positions 
we also focus on growing the business through acquisitions when they align with our strategic goals and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders 
acquisitions gibraltar acquired the ds brown company ds brown on april  for million 
ds brown is the largest ds manufacturer of specialty components for the transportation infrastructure industry and has established a leading market position for many of the products offered 
products manufactured and distributed by ds brown include expansion joint systems  structural bearing assemblies  pavement sealing systems  and other specialty components for bridges  highways  and other infrastructure projects 
on june   the company acquired pacific award metals  inc award metals for million 
award metals is a leading regional manufacturer of roof ventilation  roof trims  flashing and rain ware  drywall trims  and specialty clips and connectors for concrete forms used in the new construction and repair and remodel markets 
gibraltar s results from operations included ds brown and award metals from the respective dates of acquisition 
the acquisitions were financed through cash on hand and debt available under our revolving credit facility 
divestitures gibraltar sold its united steel products subsidiary usp in march for million 
the sale of usp  along with the acquisitions of ds brown and award metals  provide gibraltar with a broader product offering to construction markets and greater potential for revenue and earnings growth 
these transactions are consistent with management s strategy to position gibraltar as a market leader in the product areas offered by our business and to expand our offering of value added products 
on february   gibraltar completed the sale of the majority of the assets of the processed metal products business 
this transaction finalized our exit from steel processing 
this strategic initiative began in and included the sale of our steel strapping business  the sale of the hubbell steel business  and the sale of the scm powdered metal business 
these divestitures were an ongoing part of our objective to build a company with optimal operating characteristics and improve shareholder value 
we now are focused on the manufacture and distribution of building products where the company has historically generated its highest operating margins 
the divestitures described above were recognized as components of discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
economic trends the end markets served by our business are subject to economic conditions influenced by outside factors which include but are not limited to interest rates  commodity costs  demand for residential construction  the level of non residential construction and infrastructure projects  and demand within the repair and remodel market 
the united states construction markets continued an uneven recovery from an unprecedented recession that began in and led to reduced demand for the products we manufacture and distribute 
in addition  tightened credit markets over the same period may have limited the ability of the end users of our products to obtain financing for construction projects 
while the us economy has grown since the recession  the construction markets continue to face significant challenges 
construction markets have only recovered modestly from the recession and many economic indicators remain at levels well below long term averages 
as an example  the table below shows housing starts in the united states continued to remain significantly below the long term average of million starts per year september  september  september  residential housing starts the decrease in non residential construction and residential housing starts had a significant impact on the operations of our business by contributing to decreased sales volume and profitability 
to respond to current economic conditions facing gibraltar  including weakened end market conditions and volatile commodity costs  we continue to focus on providing a high level of customer service along with maintaining our position as a market share leader and low cost provider of our products 
we strive for operational excellence through lean initiatives and the consolidation of facilities to reduce costs 
as a result  we have closed or consolidated facilities over the past three years  including three during we have also aggressively reduced operating costs throughout the company to maximize cash flows generated from operating activities 
as a result of these restructuring activities  our break even point has decreased significantly since as noted above  commodity raw material prices for materials such as steel  aluminum  and resins  have also fluctuated significantly during the past three years 
these fluctuations impact the cost of raw materials we purchase and the pricing we offer to our customers 
commodity prices fell precipitously during the fourth quarter of and continued to fall during the first two quarters of the rapid decrease in commodity prices led to lower sales prices offered to customers and falling margins on our product sales during much of commodity prices rose in and have somewhat stabilized in we believe our investment in erp systems and decreased inventory requirements allow us to react better to these fluctuations and have improved our margins 
as a result of the steps we have taken throughout the economic downturn  we have increased liquidity to a strong position 
using cash generated from operations  we have made significant repayments against our outstanding debt and no longer have any amounts outstanding against our revolving credit facility as of year end 
our liquidity as of december  was million including million of cash and million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  the steps taken over the past three years allowed us to return to profitability during the year ended december  for the first time since we believe our reduced cost structure and lean manufacturing process will allow us to continue growing our revenue and profitability as the economy continues to improve 
gibraltar entered into the fourth amended and restated credit agreement dated october  the senior credit agreement to extend the due date of our million revolving credit facility  reduce the cost of borrowings  and provide additional financial flexibility 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth selected results of operations data in thousands and its percentages of net sales for the years ended december september  september  september  september  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense intangible asset impairment income loss from operations interest expense other income income loss before taxes provision for benefit of income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss the following table sets forth the impact of the company s acquisitions on net sales and operating income for the year ended december in thousands september  september  september  september  september  total change due to change acquisitions operations net sales operating income loss net sales increased by million  or  to million for from net sales of million for the most significant portion of the increase in net sales was from two acquisitions in which provided an additional million of net sales for the remaining increase in net sales was impacted by an increase in the pricing offered to customers and a increase in volume 
our selling prices increased from the prior year as a result of the higher costs we paid for steel  aluminum  and resins which impacted the selling prices offered to our customers 
sales volume improved from the previous year as a result of repairs for spring storm damage and some improved macroeconomic conditions in the industrial construction markets which offset the uneven recovery in the new build housing and commercial construction markets 
our gross margin also increased to for compared to for the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to a better alignment of material costs with customer selling prices and the impact of our acquisitions which contributed sales of products with higher gross margins 
cost reductions  increased volume  and a million reduction in restructuring costs also contributed to our improved gross margin 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for the million increase was the net result of million of additional expense from acquired businesses  increased cost of variable incentive compensation from improved operating results  million of acquisition related costs  and a million charge recognized as a result of time based equity awards surrendered by gibraltar s chief executive officer partially offset by our cost reduction efforts that resulted in decreased spending on professional services  rent  and other operating expenses 
despite the increased costs  sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for compared to for due to changes in the estimated fair value of certain reporting units resulting from a significant decrease in sales projections  we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million for no impairment charges were recognized for interest expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for the reduction in interest expense was a result of incurring a million charge in related to an ineffective interest rate swap 
the reduction was offset by incurring a million charge to write off deferred financing fees in and having slightly higher levels of debt outstanding during compared to in the first quarter of  we repaid million of debt  which constituted all outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility 
subsequently  we borrowed funds under our revolving credit facility to finance the acquisitions of ds brown and award metals during the second quarter of which were repaid in full during the third quarter of we recognized a provision for income taxes of million for  an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for exceeded the us federal statutory tax rate of due to state taxes and the impact of non deductible permanent differences 
during  we recognized a tax benefit of million  an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate due to the effect of non deductible permanent differences  a large portion of which related to the intangible asset impairment charges that were not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  we recognized a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in for certain state net operating loss carryforwards which further reduced the effective tax rate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth selected results of operations data in thousands and its percentages of net sales for the years ended december september  september  september  september  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense intangible asset impairment loss from operations interest expense other income loss before taxes benefit of income taxes loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss net sales decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease in net sales from the prior year was the net result of a decrease in volume partially offset by a increase in pricing offered to customers 
the lower volume was primarily due to the slow recovery in the economy which did not generate any significant increase in the demand for our products used in the building and industrial markets 
as previously noted  the economic downturn continues to have a negative impact on the residential construction markets and demand for products sold in this market remains low compared to historical levels 
the higher selling prices were primarily a result of increased commodity costs for steel  aluminum  and resins 
our gross margin also decreased to for from for the decrease in gross margin was attributable to a less favorable alignment of material costs to customer selling prices during the current year compared to the previous year 
the low level of sales volume led to more pressure on pricing from competitors which in some cases limited our ability to pass along material cost increases 
this factor  in combination with rising costs for our raw materials particularly late in the year  contributed to the decline in gross margins 
additionally  we incurred a million increase in restructuring charges recognized in cost of sales during compared to the prior year 
the impact of pricing pressures  raw material commodity cost fluctuations  and restructuring charges experienced during more than offset the cost reduction initiatives we implemented since to align our cost structure to a lower level of sales volume 
we have also continued lean manufacturing initiatives to further reduce our costs and improve efficiencies 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million during compared to million for the million increase was primarily the net result of an increase in variable incentive compensation driven by improved working capital management and the effect of the company s appreciating stock price on vested stock based awards during compared to this was partially offset by reductions in bad debt expense along with salary and other payroll costs 
we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives since that included restructuring the business and staff reductions which contributed to the cost reduction noted above 
during and  due to changes in the estimated fair value of certain reporting units resulting from a significant decrease in sales projections  we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for we repaid all of our variable rate debt during the first quarter of which decreased the amount of interest paid compared to the prior year 
we reduced debt outstanding by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  through debt repayments 
the benefit of income taxes for was million  an effective tax rate of  compared to million  an effective tax rate of  for the effective tax rates for and were lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to the effect of non deductible permanent differences  a large portion of which related to intangible asset impairment charges that were not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  we recognized a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in for certain state net operating loss carryforwards which further reduced the effective tax rate 
state taxes partially offset the reduction in the effective tax rate during outlook during  we experienced strong top and bottom line growth as a result of our strategic acquisitions and cost reduction efforts  despite the uneven recovery in the residential  commercial  and industrial construction markets including new building housing and repair and remolding activities 
management anticipates that we will be able to further capitalize on any meaningful growth in these markets when it occurs 
looking ahead to the first quarter of  which is historically a period of low seasonal demand for our business  we anticipate the contributions of ds brown and award metals  benefits from our continued cost reductions  and increased stability within the markets we serve to generate sales growth and profitable operating results 
over the long term  we believe that the fundamentals of the building and industrial markets are positive 
furthermore  the aggressive actions taken to streamline and improve the efficiency of our business have reduced our break even point and positioned gibraltar to generate marked improvements in profitability when economic and market conditions return toward historical levels 
liquidity and capital resources general our principal capital requirements are to fund our operations with working capital  the purchase of capital improvements for our business and facilities  and to fund acquisitions 
we will continue to invest in growth opportunities as appropriate while continuing to focus on working capital efficiency and profit improvement opportunities to minimize the cash invested to grow our business 
we have successfully generated positive cash flows from operating activities during the past two years to fund our capital requirements and  in  to help fund two acquisitions as noted below in the cash flows section of item of this annual report on form k 
we generated positive operating cash flows during these periods despite the challenging economic conditions our business faced 
in the future  we expect to continue profitable growth and sustain strong working capital management to continue to generate positive operating cash flow 
as noted above  we entered into the senior credit agreement on october   which includes a million revolving credit facility and provides gibraltar with access to capital and improved financial flexibility 
as of december   our liquidity of million consisted of million of cash and million of availability under our revolving credit facility as compared to liquidity of million as of december  we believe that availability of funds under our senior credit agreement together with the cash generated from operations should be sufficient to provide the company with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to support our principal capital requirements during the next twelve months 
our senior credit agreement provides the company with liquidity and capital resources for use by our us operations 
historically  our foreign operations have generated cash flow from operations sufficient to invest in working capital and fund their capital improvements 
as of december   our foreign subsidiaries held million of cash 
we believe cash held by our foreign subsidiaries provides our foreign operations with the necessary liquidity to meet future obligations and allows the foreign business units to reinvest in their operations 
these cash resources could eventually be used to grow our business internationally through additional acquisitions 
over the long term  we expect that future obligations  including strategic business opportunities such as acquisitions  may be financed through a number of sources  including internally available cash  availability under our revolving credit facility  new debt financing  the issuance of equity securities  or any combination of the above 
potential acquisitions are evaluated on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products  operations  or capabilities  as well as provide access to new products  markets  and customers and improve shareholder value 
the acquisitions of ds brown and award metals completed on april  and june   respectively  were financed through the use of cash on hand and debt available under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows the following table sets forth selected cash flow data for the years ended december in millions september  september  cash provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations investing activities of continuing operations financing activities of continuing operations discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   net cash provided by continuing operations totaled million  primarily driven by income from continuing operations of million and non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  and stock compensation of million 
net cash provided by continuing operations for was million and was primarily the result of a loss from continuing operations of million offset by non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  stock compensation  and intangible asset impairments of million and million of cash generated from a net decrease in assets and liabilities 
during the year ended december   the company modestly increased its investment in working capital and other net assets from december  resulting in million of cash outflow 
the company invested modest amounts into working capital despite a increase in net sales year over year due to our diligence in reducing working capital requirements and focus on lean initiatives 
cash flow invested in working capital and other net assets was impact by a million reduction in other assets as a result of collecting income tax refunds 
in addition  accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased as a result of increased material costs and larger accruals for variable incentive compensation leading to million and million of positive cash flow  respectively 
these items were offset by an increase in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million 
the increases in inventory and accounts receivable were a result of increased material costs  manufacturing activity  and sales volume during the last month of the year compared to the last month of the prior year as we expected due to the year over year growth of our business 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for of million consisted primarily of million of acquisitions and capital expenditures of million offset by million of proceeds from the sale of our usp business unit and the collection of a note receivable related to the sale of our scm business unit 
net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations for of million primarily consisted of million of proceeds from the sale of our processed metal products business offset by capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in financing activities for of million primarily consisted of million of deferred financing fees related to the senior credit agreement  million of treasury stock repurchases related to the net settlement of vested stock awards  and net repayments of million on long term debt 
net cash used in financing activities for of million consisted primarily of million of net repayments on long term debt 
cash used for discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  compared to cash generated from discontinued operations of million for these cash flows related primarily to the usp and processed metal products businesses that were divested in and  respectively

only one financial covenant is contained within the senior credit agreement  which requires us to maintain a fixed charge ratio as defined in the agreement of to or higher on a trailing four quarter basis at the end of each quarter 
as of december   we were in compliance with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
management expects to be in compliance with the fixed coverage ratio covenant throughout the next twelve months 
during  we repaid all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and did not have any borrowings under the senior credit agreement during the first quarter of to finance the acquisitions of ds brown and award metals in the second quarter of  we borrowed amounts under the revolving credit facility which were subsequently repaid during the third quarter of as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility

at december   we had million  net of discount  of our notes outstanding 
each of our significant domestic subsidiaries has guaranteed the obligations under the senior credit agreement 
the senior credit agreement contains other provisions and events of default that are customary for similar agreements and may limit our ability to take various actions 
the senior subordinate notes indenture also contains provisions that limit additional borrowings based on the company s consolidated coverage ratio

critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts selling  general  and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  which impacts our depreciation and amortization costs  the assessment of recoverability of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets  which impacts the impairment of long lived assets  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  which impacts the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities  which impact the provision for income taxes 
management reviews the estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves  on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experience  current conditions  and future expectations 
management believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
valuation of accounts receivable our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
as of december  and  allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million were recorded  respectively  or of gross accounts receivable for both periods 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectible based on various factors  including experience  creditworthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
valuation of inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first in  first out basis using a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost 
on a regular basis  we calculate an estimated market value of our inventory  considered to be the prevailing selling price for the inventory less the cost to complete and sell the product 
we compare the current carrying value of our inventory to the estimated market value to determine whether a reserve to value inventory at the lower of cost or market is necessary 
we recorded insignificant charges during the three year period ended december  to value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
we recorded reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory of million and million as of december  and  respectively  or of gross inventories for both periods 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory 
accounting for acquired assets and liabilities when we acquire a business  we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values 
we record any premium over the fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair value 
the way we characterize the assets has important implications  as long lived assets with definitive lives  for example  are depreciated or amortized  whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment  as explained below 
with respect to determining the fair value of assets  the most subjective estimates involve valuations of long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment as well as identified intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
the fair values of long lived assets are determined using valuation techniques that use discounted cash flow methods  independent market appraisals  and other acceptable valuation techniques 
the following summarizes the amount of purchase price allocated to property  plant  and equipment  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill for the acquisitions completed in in millions september  september  september  september  september  acquisition initial purchase price property  plant  and equipment identified intangible assets goodwill other net assets ds brown award metals due to the subjectivity inherent in determining the fair value of long lived assets and the significant number of acquisitions we have completed  we believe the allocation of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities is a critical accounting policy 
impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment as of december  in millions september  property  plant  and equipment  net acquired intangibles with finite lives other assets impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by discounted cash flow method  an independent market appraisal of the asset  or another acceptable valuation technique 
we recognized impairment charges for property  plant  and equipment as a result of restructuring activities during the years ended december  and and for amortizable intangible assets 
no depreciable or amortizable long lived assets were impaired during the year ended december  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset balances of million and million as of december   respectively  are subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october and at interim dates when indicators of impairment are present 
indicators of impairment could include a significant long term adverse change in business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
during  we concluded that no new indicators of impairment existed at interim dates and did not perform any interim impairment tests related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we tested goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of at the annual test date 
no impairment charges were recognized as a result of the october  impairment test 
however  the company recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
in addition to the annual impairment test  goodwill and other indefinite lived assets were tested for impairment at two interim dates during march and june we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
as of the october  impairment test  we identified eleven reporting units in total  of which ten have goodwill 
we added two reporting units from acquisitions completed during and reduced the number of reporting units by one as a result of a divestiture 
the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the following table sets forth the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit tested for goodwill impairment and the percentage by which the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the october  goodwill impairment test in thousands september  september  reporting unit goodwill allocated to reporting unit percentage by which estimated fair value exceeds carrying value the october  goodwill impairment test included significant assumptions 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units as a part of step one of the impairment test  we used two valuation techniques an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach included a discounted cash flow model relying on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts  terminal value  and the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount future cash flows 
the market approach consisted of applying an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple to the forecasted ebitda to be generated in and the market approach also relied on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts and the ebitda multiple selected from an analysis of peer companies 
the following table sets forth the compound annual revenue growth rate for the five year period used to forecast cash flows and the average operating margin for the forecasted periods compared to actual operating margins generated over the long term september  september  september  reporting unit compound annual revenue growth rate for forecasted periods operating margins for forecasted periods actual long term operating margins a b c c d a operating margins presented exclude restructuring charges incurred by each reporting unit 
b this reporting unit made an incremental acquisition of a product line with significantly higher margins than the existing product lines it offers 
additionally  this reporting unit s operations were restructured in as a result  we believe forecasted operating margins will exceed prior results 
c the operating margins presented only include operating results generated since the dates these reporting units were acquired by gibraltar 
since these operating results were generated during an economic downturn  we do not believe the results are representative of recent results or results expected in future periods 
d this reporting unit s operations were restructured in the reporting unit has since generated operating margins approaching 
we analyzed third party forecasts of housing starts and other macroeconomic indicators that impact each reporting unit to provide a reasonable estimate of revenue growth in future periods 
our analysis of third party forecasts noted that housing starts were projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of from to therefore  we considered these forecasts in developing each reporting unit s growth rates over the next five years depending on the level of correlation between housing starts and net sales for each reporting unit 
the correlation between housing starts and net sales was based on an analysis of historical housing starts and our historical revenue 
we concluded that this approach provided a reasonable estimate of long term revenue growth and cash flows for each reporting unit 
operating margins used to estimate future cash flows were consistent with long term margins generated by the reporting units while they have been owned and operated by gibraltar as shown in the table above 
the reporting units where forecasted operating margins exceed long term operating margins generated by the reporting unit were for reporting units that were recently acquired and  therefore  the long term operating margins were more significantly impacted by the economic turmoil that began in additionally  we took strategic actions to consolidate facilities  reduce costs  and restructure these business units to become more profitable as the economy recovers 
these actions led to increased costs and lower operating margins in the short term 
based on our understanding of these reporting units and the actions taken by management to restructure the businesses for improved growth and profitability  we concluded that the long term cash flows forecasted for all of the company s reporting units were reasonable 
in addition to revenue growth and operating margin forecasts  the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit also uses assumptions for the amount of working capital needed to support each reporting unit 
we forecasted modest improvement in working capital management for future periods at each reporting unit based on past performance 
the company experienced a significant reduction in days of working capital from days for the year ended december  to days for the year ended december  we have been able to significantly improve our working capital management through lean initiatives  efficiency improvements  and facility consolidations 
we believe continued improvement in our ability to manage working capital will allow us to increase the cash flow generated from each reporting unit 
the terminal value of each reporting unit was based on a projected terminal year of forecasted cash flows in our discounted cash flow model 
we made an assumption that cash flows would grow each year thereafter based on our approximation of gross domestic product growth in the north american and european markets served by the company 
this assumption was based on a third party forecast of future economic growth over the long term 
the discounted cash flow model uses the wacc to discount cash flows in the forecasted period and to discount the terminal value to present value 
to determine the wacc  we used a standard valuation method  the capital asset pricing model  based on readily available and current market data of peer companies considered market participants 
acknowledging the risk inherent in each reporting units ability to achieve long term forecasted cash flows  in applying the income approach we increased the wacc of each reporting unit based upon each reporting unit s past operating performance and their relative ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows 
as a result of these analyses  we assigned a wacc between and for each reporting unit 
the ebitda multiple used in the market approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit was applied to the forecasted ebitda to be generated during and the market approach relies on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts and the ebitda multiple selected from an analysis of peer companies considered market participants 
the revenue growth rates and profit margins used in the market approach were the same projections used in the discounted cash flows model as described above 
the ebitda multiples were established by analyzing each peer companies total invested capital in proportion to ebitda derived from each peer companies most recently reported earnings 
similar to the wacc analysis  we assessed the risk of each reporting unit achieving its forecasts with consideration given to how each reporting unit has performed historically compared to forecasts 
as a result of these analyses  we assigned an ebitda multiple between and for ebitda forecasts and and for ebitda forecasts 
as noted above  we used two commonly accepted valuation techniques to estimate a fair value for each reporting unit 
the estimated fair value for each reporting unit was calculated using a weighted average between the calculated amounts determined under the income approach and the market approach 
we weighted the income approach more heavily as the technique uses a long term approach that considers the expected operating profit of each reporting unit during periods where housing starts and other macroeconomic indicators are nearer historical averages 
the market approach values the reporting units using and ebitda values which were forecasted using estimated housing starts of  and  respectively 
housing starts have historically approximated million each year 
we believe the income approach considers the expected recovery in the residential building market better than the market approach 
therefore  we concluded that the income approach more accurately estimated the fair value of the reporting units as it considers earnings potential during a longer term and does not use the short term perspective used by the market approach 
accordingly  we concluded that the market participants who execute transactions to sell or buy a business in the current economic environment would place greater emphasis on the income approach 
the following table sets forth the company s estimated fair value and carrying value for each reporting unit as of october  in thousands september  september  reporting unit estimated fair value carrying value others without goodwill corporate total net debt equity net book value total the corporate category includes unallocated corporate cash out flows 
unallocated corporate cash out flows include executive compensation and other administrative costs 
gibraltar has grown substantially through acquisitions and our strategy is to allow business unit management to operate the business units autonomous of corporate management 
for example  each business unit has its own accounting  marketing  purchasing  information technology  and executive functions 
as a result  we believe a market participant would not consider unallocated corporate cash flows when valuing each reporting unit and these cash flows have been properly excluded from the valuation of the reporting units 
we also performed a reconciliation of the total estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of october  to support the reasonableness of the fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment test 
the following calculation provides this reconciliation and the resulting control premium determined as of our october  impairment analysis in thousands september  september  september  estimated fair value estimated market capitalization estimated fair value of reporting units less net debt as of october  shares outstanding as of october  average stock price from october  to november  value of equity control premium despite the difference between our net book value and the estimated fair value of equity  all reporting units with goodwill had fair values in excess of their carrying value 
the difference between our net book value and the estimated fair value of equity is the result of the negative future cash flows associated with our unallocated corporate net assets as described above 
although the book value of equity exceeds our market capitalization  we deemed the control premium as of the october  impairment analysis to be reasonable based upon recent comparable transactions to acquire the control of similar businesses in our industry 
accordingly  we concluded the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was reasonably estimated 
we test our intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  determined using a discounted cash flow model  with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value 
we recognized impairment charges for indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our october  and impairment tests 
the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets are consistent with the assumptions employed in the determination of the fair values of our reporting units 
accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent differences between income or loss reported for financial statement purposes and tax purposes  provisions for uncertain tax positions  state taxes  and income generated by international operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during the year ended december   deferred income tax liabilities increased primarily as a result of the acquisitions of the stock of ds brown and award metals 
regarding deferred income tax assets  we maintained valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets  primarily consisting of state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future operating results do not meet expectations  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
it is our policy to record estimated interest and penalties due to tax authorities as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
insignificant amounts of interest and penalties were recognized in the provision for income taxes for during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million of interest and penalties  respectively 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities  based on the technical merits of each position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
as of december  and  the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million and million  respectively 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
related party transactions a member of our board of directors  gerald s 
lippes  is a partner in a law firm that provides legal services to gibraltar 
for the years ended december    and  the company incurred costs of million  million  and million  respectively  for legal services from this firm 
costs incurred increased significantly for as a result of additional legal services provided for the acquisitions completed in and our amended senior credit agreement 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  recorded in accounts payable for amounts due to this law firm

sadler  jr  is a member of the board of directors of m t bank corporation  one of the ten participating lenders which have committed capital to our million revolving credit facility in our senior credit agreement 
all amounts outstanding under the senior credit agreement were repaid in full as of december  and and million of principal and interest was paid to the lenders during the year ended december  borrowings under the senior credit agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus an additional margin of to  based on the amount of borrowings available to gibraltar 
the revolving credit facility also carries an annual facility fee of on the undrawn portion of the facility and fees on outstanding letters of credit which are payable quarterly 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update update  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
update generally clarifies the requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this update results in common principles and requirements regarding fair value measurements for us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and are to be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect the adoption of update will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued update  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amendments included in update  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the company adopted update retrospectively in which did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results from operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued update  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
under the amendments included in update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  the two step impairment test is required 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  although early adoption is permitted 
although the amendments may change how goodwill is tested for impairment  the company does not expect the adoption of update will have a material impact on the timing or measurement of any goodwill impairments

the company participates in various multiemployer pension plans and was required to disclose additional information about these plans in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as included in item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  competition  and raw materials pricing and availability 
in addition  the company is exposed to other financial market risks  primarily related to its long term debt and foreign operations 
raw material pricing risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to volatility in the price of steel  aluminum  and resins 
a significant amount of our cost of sales relates to material costs 
our business is heavily dependent on the price and supply of our raw materials 
our various products are fabricated from steel  primarily hot rolled and galvanized steel coils and bars  produced by mills and service centers 
many of our products are also fabricated from aluminum coils and resins 
the commodity market  which includes the steel  aluminum  and resin industries  is highly cyclical in nature  and commodity costs have been volatile in recent years and may remain volatile in the future 
commodity costs are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  the availability of raw materials  competition  labor costs  freight and transportation costs  production costs  import duties and other trade restrictions 
although we have the ability to purchase steel from a number of suppliers  a production cutback by one or more of our current suppliers could create challenges in meeting delivery schedules to our customers 
the prices we offer to our customers are also impacted by changes in commodity costs 
we manage the alignment of the cost of our raw materials and prices offered to customers and attempt to pass changes to raw material costs through to our customers 
to improve our management of commodity costs  we attempt to maintain lean inventory levels 
our investment in erp systems was made to increase our effectiveness in this process 
we do not enter into long term contracts for the purchase of raw materials and do not maintain inventory levels in excess of our production requirements 
however  from time to time  we may purchase raw materials in advance of commodity cost increases 
we rely on major suppliers for our supply of raw materials 
during  we purchased our raw materials from domestic and foreign suppliers in an effort to purchase the lowest cost material as possible 
we cannot accurately calculate the pre tax impact a one percent change in the commodity costs would have on our operating results as the change in commodity costs would both impact the cost to purchase materials and the selling prices we offer our customers 
the impact to our operating results would significantly depend on the competitive environment and the costs of other alternative building products  which could impact our ability to pass commodity costs to our customers 
interest rate risk to manage interest rate risk  gibraltar uses both fixed and variable interest rate debt 
we repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and no amounts remain outstanding as of december  as a result  fixed rate debt consisting of the company s senior subordinated notes is the only significant debt that remains outstanding at year end 
we believe we limited our exposure to interest rate risk as a result of repaying substantially all variable rate debt and the long term nature of our fixed rate debt 
however  the company will continue to monitor changes in its debt levels and access to capital ensuring interest rate risk is appropriately managed 
at december   our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of million  net of discount  of our notes 
the company s million of notes were issued in december at a discount to yield 
the notes are due december  our variable rate debt consists primarily of the revolving credit facility under the senior credit agreement  of which no amounts are outstanding as of december   and other debt 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable interest rate based upon the libor plus an additional margin 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have changed the interest expense by approximately million 
foreign exchange risk gibraltar has foreign exchange risk in our international operations  primarily located in canada and europe  and through purchases from foreign vendors 
therefore  changes in the values of currencies of these countries affect our financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we accepted our exposure to exchange rate movements relative to gibraltar s international operations and do not hedge our foreign exchange risk exposures 
a change of in the value of all applicable foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our financial position and cash flows
