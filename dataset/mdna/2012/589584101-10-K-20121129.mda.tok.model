table of contents c 
difficile products our illumigene molecular c 
difficile product has now been available in markets around the world for over two years 
sales of this product were approximately  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
approximately clinical laboratories are current customers using our illumigene platform  which now includes three tests see below for a discussion of our second and third tests for group b and group a strep 
while the majority of these customers have adopted the c 
difficile assay  a growing number of customers are purchasing multiple assays for the platform 
our illumigene molecular c 
difficile product has restored the c 
difficile product family to positive sales growth  and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our major competitors in this product family are cepheid and becton dickinson molecular and alere immunoassay 
we believe that we have two principal advantages versus our competition 
first  our molecular instrumentation package has a smaller footprint and significantly lower cost than either cepheid or becton dickinson 
we believe that this advantage allows our product to fit into virtually any size hospital or reference laboratory 
we believe that our second principal advantage is the breadth of our c 
difficile product offerings 
with the launch of our molecular product and fda clearance of our common antigen c 
difficile products premier c 
difficile gdh received fda clearance in may  and immunocard c 
difficile gdh received fda clearance in december we believe we are in a unique position to offer a full line of testing solutions to our clinical laboratory customers around the world to counter the competitive pressures surrounding this market 
additionally  we hold the only fda approved claim for c 
difficile testing in the pediatric population 
these advantages  along with the performance features of the products in our c 
difficile portfolio  give us a compelling product offering for any hospital testing method preference 
during fiscal  we received fda clearance for our second and third molecular tests for the illumigene molecular platform illumigene gbs group b streptococcus in december and illumigene group a strep group a streptococcus in september as alluded to above  over customers are now purchasing two assays for the illumigene platform the majority being c 
difficile and gbs with revenue generated by our gbs test approximating  during fiscal in addition  with the recent introduction of our group a strep test  there are a growing number of customers adopting all three of our molecular platform assays 
a test for mycoplasma pneumoniae walking pneumonia was recently submitted to the fda for marketing clearance and is expected to be available for sale in the us during the second quarter of fiscal our fifth test on the illumigene platform is for bordetella pertussis whooping cough  which is expected to be available for sale in the us during the third or fourth quarter of fiscal our development pipeline for illumigene also includes two sexually transmitted disease assays  expected to be available for sale in the us during the first half of fiscal in addition to cepheid  becton dickinson and alere  other competitors are beginning to enter the c 
difficile market 
quest diagnostics and great basin recently received fda clearance for a molecular c 
difficile test and quidel received ce marking approval for a molecular c 
difficile test for sale within the european union 
although we believe that the breadth of our c 
difficile product offerings and our low cost molecular platform provide key advantages to the offerings of our competitors  selling prices may come under pressure as more competitors enter the market 

table of contents foodborne products although our foodborne products are marketed and sold on a global basis  most of our sales volume is within the us diagnostics segment 
we continue to see demand increases in the united states  as laboratories realize the benefits of increased sensitivity and faster turnaround time with our tests for enterohemorrhagic e 
coli ehec and campylobacter  compared to traditional culture methods 
sales increases for these products within the us diagnostics segment were and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the market acceptance and volume growth of these products has resulted in annual global revenues for this disease family surpassing the  mark 
we believe that the primary competition for our foodborne products is laboratory culture methods 
we believe that our products have two principal advantages versus culture methods 
the first principal advantage is test accuracy 
independent evaluations have shown our products to have higher sensitivity than culture methods 
the second principal advantage is improved work flow of the testing process  resulting in a significantly shortened time to test result 
our single use rapid products provide a test result in approximately minutes  whereas culture results can take up to hours 
time to test result can be a critical factor in the physician s choice of therapies 
h 
pylori products during fiscal  sales of our h 
pylori products grew for our us diagnostics segment and increased for our european diagnostics segment on an organic basis  compared to the year over year sales activity these segments experienced in of growth and decline  respectively 
the increase for our us diagnostics segment continues to reflect the benefits of our partnerships with managed care companies in promoting the health and economic benefits of a test and treat strategy  and the ongoing effects of such strategy moving physician behavior away from serology based testing toward direct antigen testing 
we continue to expect that our efforts with managed care companies in the us will provide low to mid teens growth opportunities for the next several years 
the sales results for our european diagnostics segment reflect the ongoing impact of pricing pressures from competitive products in european markets 
respiratory products during fiscal  respiratory sales for our diagnostics segments decreased compared to fiscal  following a year over year decrease from fiscal to fiscal the dramatic sales fluctuation for this family in recent years is a direct result of the end of the novel a hn outbreak late in the fiscal first quarter 
total non influenza respiratory product sales remained relatively flat compared to fiscal  with sales of such products increasing for our us diagnostics segment and decreasing for our european diagnostics segment on an organic basis 
at present  we do not expect significant revenue increases from influenza products in fiscal and expect annual influenza product revenues to be approximately  to  consistent with the last two fiscal years 

table of contents group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks in our us diagnostics segment  consolidation of the us healthcare industry over the last several years has led to the creation of group purchasing organizations gpos and integrated delivery networks idns that aggregate buying power for hospital groups and put pressure on our selling prices 
we have multi year supply agreements with several gpos and idns 
life science segment sales for our life science segment increased in fiscal  reflecting increases in both our core bulk reagent business and our molecular reagent business 
the year over year increase in the core bulk reagent business largely results from increased orders for rubella and hepatitis a proteins 
our molecular reagent business  operated through our bioline group  continues to benefit from its new product launches and advancements during recent months most notably its new sensifast and mytaq pcr components 
revenues for our life science segment are inherently dependent upon customer order patterns and timing of contract manufacturing work 
for fiscal  we expect overall revenue growth of our life science segment to be in the range of to  led by the bioline group  which we expect to generate double digit increases in sales of its molecular reagent products 
we expect sales of our bulk antigen  antibody and reagent products to decline slightly in fiscal due to a slowing immunoassay demand profile 
while we are seeing opportunities in china for our bulk antigen  antibody and reagent products  it will likely take the next year to generate actual revenue 
as a result of the order volume trends in bulk antigens  antibodies and reagents  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of our saco  maine facility  and completed the consolidation of manufacturing operations into our memphis  tennessee facility during the second fiscal quarter of total costs to complete the consolidation of facilities approximated  consisting of fixed asset impairments  inventory impairments  stay bonuses and moving costs  among other similar items 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized approximately  of these costs  and recognized the remaining  during the first three quarters of fiscal foreign currency during fiscal  currency exchange rates had an approximate  unfavorable impact on revenue   within the european diagnostics segment and in the life science segment 
this compares to currency exchange having an approximate favorable impact on revenue in fiscal 
table of contents the volatility in the euro usd exchange rate increased significantly during the last half of the fiscal year  and this may continue into the foreseeable future until such time as the sovereign debt crisis situation in europe is resolved 
each one point decline in the euro usd exchange rate eg  to negatively affects the revenues of our european diagnostics segment by approximately however  we would not expect such exchange rate fluctuations to have a significant impact on operating income 
this results from the fact that we are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to the supply of certain european manufactured diagnostic test kits  which serves to provide a natural hedge against the impact on european diagnostics revenue 
significant customers our us diagnostic segment s sales through two national distributors were of the us diagnostics segment s total sales for both fiscal and fiscal  or of consolidated sales  for both fiscal and fiscal our life science segment s sales of purified antigens and reagents to two diagnostic manufacturing customers were of the life science segment s total sales for fiscal or of our consolidated sales for fiscal  compared to and of fiscal life science segment and consolidated sales  respectively 
segment revenues our reportable segments are us diagnostics  european diagnostics and life science 
the us diagnostics segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of australia  europe  africa and the middle east 
the european diagnostics segment consists of the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in australia  europe  africa and the middle east 
the life science segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee  boca raton  florida  london  england  luckenwalde  germany  and sydney  australia  and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies  pcr qpcr reagents  nucleotides  competent cells and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad 
the life science segment also includes the contract development and manufacture of proteins and other biologicals for use by biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in research for new drugs and vaccines 
revenues for the diagnostics segments  in the normal course of business  may be affected by buying patterns of major distributors  seasonality and strength of certain diseases  and foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues for the life science segment  in the normal course of business  may be affected by the timing and nature of arrangements for contract services work  which may have longer production cycles than bioresearch reagents and bulk antigens and antibodies  as well as buying patterns of major customers 
we believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues

product sales mix shifts  in the normal course of business  can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points 

table of contents operating expenses research development selling marketing general administrative other total operating expenses expenses of sales fiscal increases decreases us diagnostics european diagnostics life science bioline group core transaction costs expenses of sales increase decrease fiscal increases decreases us diagnostics european diagnostics life science bioline group core expenses of sales increase decrease overall  the relative stability in total operating expense during fiscal and the increase in fiscal result in large part from the combined effects of our i fiscal efforts to control spending in each of our segments while investing the necessary resources in our strategic areas of growth  ii beginning to realize cost savings during from the consolidation of our core life science operations into one facility  iii incurring costs in connection with the consolidation of our saco  maine operations into our memphis  tennessee location of approximately  during fiscal  and approximately  during fiscal of an operating expense nature  iv incurring during the second quarter of fiscal approximately  of costs in connection with the reorganization of our european and global sales and marketing leadership  and v realizing the impact on all three operating expense categories ie  research development  selling marketing  and general administrative during fiscal of adding the bioline group s full year operating expenses 
operating expenses for the us diagnostics segment increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal  and increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal these overall increases result largely from the combined effects of the following 
table of contents fiscal research development overall increase in spending on new product development activities  related primarily to our illumigene platform based test for group a streptococcus  including an approximate increase in personnel related costs 
selling marketing field sales force realignment activities during the year resulting in decreased sales commission expenses of approximately  general administrative improved corporate wide operating results resulting in increased bonus  profit sharing and deferred compensation expenses of approximately  partially offset by an approximate decrease in stock based compensation during fiscal fiscal research development overall increase in spending on new product development activities related to products submitted to the fda during the year and planned for submission during fiscal  as well as spending on increased illumigene component qualification activities 
costs include increased personnel related and quality control costs of approximately and  respectively 
selling marketing the launch of illumigene resulting in increased sales commissions expenses and increased travel and trade show expenses of approximately and  respectively 
general administrative the positive effects of overall cost containment and reduction efforts being offset by an approximate increase in stock based compensation during fiscal operating expenses for the european diagnostics segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal  and increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease primarily reflects the effect of the aforementioned reorganization of our sales and marketing leadership during the fiscal second quarter being partially offset by increased costs of additional management personnel 
the fiscal increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the sales and marketing leadership reorganization during the fiscal second quarter 

table of contents operating expenses for the life science segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal  and increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal  excluding the effect of one time transaction costs of  in fiscal the decrease in primarily results from realizing cost savings from the maine tennessee facility consolidation  and an increased investment in bioline group sales resources 
the increase in resulted from the addition of the bioline group s full year operating expenses and the costs related to consolidating the maine and tennessee facilities 
the amount of stock based compensation expense reported for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
in november  we granted restricted shares and restricted share units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted shares or restricted share units vesting in total in four years  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal dividend equivalents were paid on these shares and units throughout fiscal while the fiscal earnings target was not met  on september   the compensation committee of the board of directors chose to convert the performance based restricted shares to time vested restricted shares vesting in total after four years in recognition of the achievement in fiscal of several strategic initiatives 
expense totaling was recorded in fiscal as a result of this conversion  and is included in the total amount of stock based compensation set forth above 
during november  we granted restricted shares and restricted share units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted shares or restricted share units vesting in full in four years  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal although dividend equivalents were paid on these shares and units throughout fiscal  because meridian s fiscal net earnings did not reach the minimum level in  the performance based awards were not earned and no stock based compensation has been recorded for these performance based awards 
similar to previous years  during fiscal  we granted restricted share units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted share units vesting in total on the fourth anniversary of the grant date  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal while dividend equivalents were paid on these units throughout fiscal  the target for fiscal was not met and the performance based portion of the restricted share units granted during fiscal has been cancelled 
additionally  during fiscal  we granted restricted share units and options to certain executive management employees to reward them for meeting company revenue targets in advance of planned expectations 
these awards can only be earned if specified cumulative revenue thresholds are met one fiscal quarter in advance of planned revenue expectations through fiscal  with the three measurement dates for ratably earning one third of the grant being i the month period ending june   ii the month period ending june  and iii the month period ending june  to date  no expense has been recognized for these restricted share units and options 

table of contents operating income operating income increased and decreased in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 
other income and expense interest income was  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases during the periods reflect i lower interest yields in the current interest rate environment  ii the use of cash early in the fiscal fourth quarter to acquire the bioline group  and iii the use of cash in fiscal to fund facility expansions in cincinnati and memphis  and to build illumigene inventory 
the increased level of other income during fiscal reflects an approximate increase in net currency gains  partially offset by an approximate decrease in the bioline group s grant income from a foreign government 
during fiscal  the higher level of other income  net  can primarily be attributed to the addition of the bioline group  as it contributed grant income from a foreign government agency of approximately as noted  the level of grant income significantly decreased in fiscal and is not expected to continue at a significant level  if at all  in fiscal due to the local country s rules regarding ownership by a us parent 
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal primarily resulted from the net tax benefit on dividends from a foreign based subsidiary  while the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to the release of certain reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the passage of the relevant statutes of limitations and the nondeductible nature of bioline acquisition costs 
impact of inflation to the extent feasible  we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin  revenue or operating income in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis our cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets  consideration of acquisition plans  and consideration of common share dividends 
we have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities 
our investment portfolio presently consists of overnight repurchase agreements 

table of contents we have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio 
our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to i preserve capital  ii provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions  and iii capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy s investment eligibility criteria 
as we look forward  we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective 
at the present time  we do not expect current conditions in the financial markets  or overall economic conditions to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs  financial condition  or results of operations  although no assurances can be made in this regard 
we intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand 
if needed  we also have an additional source of liquidity through our  bank credit facility 
approximately   of our accounts receivable at september  is due from italian hospital customers whose funding ultimately comes from the italian government 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal  we experienced a deterioration in the aging of our italian accounts receivable 
while such aging appeared to stabilize during fiscal  we continue to monitor such accounts closely 
our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and or liquidity and credit within the financial markets remains tight for an extended period of time  and such conditions impact the collectibility of our customer accounts receivable or impact credit terms with our vendors  or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services 
fluctuations in overall stock market valuations may raise questions as to the potential impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
our annual goodwill impairment review takes place as of june th each year 
there have been no impairments from these annual reviews 
as of october   our stock price was per share  compared to our book value per share of as of september  this relationship  stock price trading at a x multiple of book value  is an indicator that the fluctuation in overall stock market valuations and its impact on our stock price has not been a triggering event for impairment of our goodwill and other long lived assets 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in fiscal reflecting the increase in net earnings and the effects of net working capital changes related to our investments in illumigene inventory  including readers  and the timing of payments from customers and payments to suppliers 
net cash used for investing activities was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease in cash used primarily results from an approximate  decrease in expenditures for property  plant and equipment compared to fiscal  which included significant facility expansions in both cincinnati and memphis 

table of contents net cash used for financing activities was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase was attributable to the combined effects of a increase in dividend payments and an approximate  decrease in proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
net cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures and dividends during the next twelve months 
during the last two quarters of fiscal  as well as for the full fiscal year  the per share amount of our cash dividend was lower than our diluted earnings per share  nearly in line with our long standing policy of establishing a dividend payout ratio between and of diluted earnings per share 
during fiscal  we believe that this positive dividend payout relationship will continue  although no assurances can be made in this regard 
during fiscal  cash generated from the company s operating activities exceeded the quarterly dividend by 
capital resources we have a  credit facility with a commercial bank which expires september  as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding on this facility and we had borrowing capacity available to us 
we have had no borrowings outstanding under this facility during fiscal or fiscal our capital expenditures are estimated to range between approximately  to  for fiscal  with the actual amount depending upon actual operating results and the phasing of certain projects 
such expenditures may be funded with cash and equivalents on hand  operating cash flows  and or availability under the  credit facility discussed above 
medical device tax included within the us government s comprehensive healthcare reform legislation  enacted during  was the establishment of a excise tax on the sales of medical devices beginning in calendar we currently anticipate that this legislation will result in an excise tax for our company of approximately  in fiscal at the present time it is believed that little  if any  of this cost can be passed on to customers 
known contractual obligations known contractual obligations and their related due dates were as follows as of september  total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations uncertain income tax positions liability and interest total 
table of contents meridian and its subsidiaries are lessees of i office and warehouse buildings in ohio  massachusetts  florida  australia  belgium  france  holland  germany and the uk  ii automobiles for use by the diagnostic direct sales forces in the us and europe  and iii certain office equipment such as facsimile machines and copier machines across all business units  under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates 
meridian s purchase obligations are primarily outstanding purchase orders for inventory and service items 
these contractual commitments are not in excess of expected production requirements over the next twelve months 
as of september   our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties were and  respectively 
due to inherent uncertainties in the timing of settlement of tax positions  we are unable to estimate the timing of the effective settlement of these obligations 
other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements license agreements meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to approximately  in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the us diagnostics segment 
meridian entered into a license agreement in october with a third party that provides rights to a molecular technology for infectious disease testing in the united states  europe and other geographic markets 
the agreement  as amended  calls for remaining payments of up to approximately  based on the achievement of certain product development milestones and on going royalties once products are available for commercial sale 
off balance sheet arrangements except for the operating lease arrangements noted above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
market risk exposure foreign currency risk we have market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our european distribution operations where the billing currency is the euro for most of our customers in these markets 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk related to the supply of certain diagnostic test kits by manufacturers located in germany and spain 
these foreign currency risks are opposite one another  providing a natural hedge with respect to consolidated gross profit and operating income 
additionally  as a result of the july bioline group acquisition  we are exposed to foreign currency risks related to the bioline group s operations in australia australian dollar  germany euro  and the uk british pound 
assessing foreign currency exposures is a component of our overall ongoing risk management process  with such currency risks managed as we believe appropriate

such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized from sales when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics segment is reduced at the date of sale for product price adjustments due certain distributors under local contracts designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling our products 
management estimates accruals for distributor price adjustments based on local contract terms  sales data provided by distributors  estimates of inventories of our products held by distributors  historical statistics  current trends  and other factors 
changes to the accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 
revenue for our diagnostics segments includes bundled product revenue for our illumigene molecular test system 
the bundled product includes an instrument  instrument accessories and test kits 
if not sold outright  amounts invoiced for the illumigene test kits cover the instrument  accessories and test kits 
revenue is recognized based on test kit sales 
if not sold outright  costs for the instruments are recognized in cost of sales over the expected instrument utilization period  generally three years 

table of contents life science revenue for contract services may come from research and development services or manufacturing services  including process development work  or a combination of both 
revenue is recognized based on each of the deliverables in a given arrangement having distinct and separate customer pricing 
pricing is often subject to a competitive bidding process 
contract research and development services may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
for contract manufacturing services  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
in some cases  customers may request that we store on their behalf  clinical grade biologicals that we produce under contract manufacturing agreements 
these cases arise when customers do not have clinical grade storage facilities or do not want to risk contamination during transport 
for such cases  revenue may be recognized on a bill and hold basis 
no such bill and hold arrangements existed at september  or september  inventories our inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out fifo basis for substantially all of our inventories 
we establish reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates these reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions were to be less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and recorded in the period known 
such adjustments would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
intangible assets our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from these analyses 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
there were no events or circumstances in fiscal  or indicating that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 

table of contents our ability to recover intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
management is required to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies  and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  this could trigger impairment of intangible assets and other long lived assets 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes our provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
we prepare estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of our tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in our non us subsidiaries are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
we believe that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid locally 
from time to time  our tax returns in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
to the extent that adjustments result from the completion of these examinations or the lapsing of statutes of limitation  they will affect tax liabilities in the period known 
we believe that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition or results of operations
