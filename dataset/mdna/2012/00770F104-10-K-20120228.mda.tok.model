item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are a global leader in infrastructure protection  providing proprietary technologies and services to protect against the corrosion of industrial pipelines and for the rehabilitation and strengthening of sewer  water  energy and mining piping systems and buildings  bridges  tunnels and waterfront structures 
we offer one of the broadest portfolios of cost effective solutions for rehabilitating aging or deteriorating infrastructure and protecting new infrastructure from corrosion 
our business activities include research and development  manufacturing  distribution  installation  coating and insulation  cathodic protection and licensing 
our products and services are currently utilized and performed in more than countries across six continents 
we believe that the depth and breadth of our products and services platform make us a leading one stop provider for the world s infrastructure rehabilitation and protection needs 
we are organized into five reportable segments energy and mining  north american sewer and water rehabilitation  european sewer and water rehabilitation  asia pacific sewer and water rehabilitation and commercial and structural 
we regularly review and evaluate our reportable segments 
market changes between the segments are typically independent of each other  unless a macroeconomic event affects the sewer and water rehabilitation markets  the oil  mining and gas markets and the commercial and structural markets concurrently 
these changes exist for a variety of reasons  including  but not limited to  local economic conditions  weather related issues and levels of government funding 
our long term strategy consists of expanding our position in the growing and profitable energy and mining sector through organic growth  selective acquisitions of companies  formation of strategic alliances and by conducting complimentary product and technology acquisitions  growing market opportunities in the commercial and structural infrastructure sector a through i continued customer acceptance of current products and technologies and ii expansion of our product and service offerings with respect to protection  rehabilitation and restoration of a broader group of infrastructure assets and b by leveraging our premier brand and experience of successfully innovating and delivering technologies and services through selective acquisitions of companies and technologies and through strategic alliances  expanding all of our businesses in key emerging markets such as asia and the middle east  and streamlining our wastewater rehabilitation operations by improving project execution  cost management practices  including the reduction of redundant fixed costs  and product mix  and by identifying opportunities to streamline key management functions and processes to improve our profitability  and strongly emphasizing higher return manufacturing operations

our north american sewer and water rehabilitation business experienced challenging market conditions  including a product mix shift to lower margin small diameter pipes  smaller projects and other market challenges in project bids and releases 
additionally  our energy and mining segment experienced a lull in large diameter pipe coating projects 
also contributing to the decline in income from continuing operations were acquisition related costs of million million  net of tax  restructuring costs associated with a reduction in force of million million  net of tax and expenses associated with an expanded credit facility  which included a million million  net of tax make whole payment for the redemption of our outstanding senior notes and million million  net of tax write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
revenues during increased by million  or  primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from our recent acquisitions of crts  hockway and fyfe na and international revenue growth in our industrial linings operations 
these growth areas were partially offset by downturns in our north american sewer and water rehabilitation business  as well as our pipe coating operations in the united states 
gross margins in were lower than the margins achieved in primarily due to lower gross margins achieved by our north american sewer and water rehabilitation segment due to delays in project bids and releases causing lower volume and other performance issues principally in the western and eastern regions of the united states 
in addition  there have been a larger percentage of small diameter pipe projects putting pressure on project management and margins 
gross margin rates achieved by our energy and mining segment continue to be lower than the prior year due to a change in the geographic mix of our industrial linings operations  which performed more work internationally  where margins are historically lower than north america and a change in the product mix in our coating operations to smaller diameter 
we implemented improvements to our north american sewer and water rehabilitation business in the second half of  and we are experiencing robust market conditions throughout our key growth segments of energy and mining and commercial and structural 
consolidated operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily related to our recent acquisitions and increased costs to support the global growth of our energy and mining segment 
these increases were partially offset by continued focus on operational efficiencies and cost containment efforts throughout the organization  specifically our north american sewer and water rehabilitation segment 
during  we recorded million of pre tax severance related costs for a reduction in force across all segments of our company including our corporate headquarters 
the majority of these costs were paid in and we do not anticipate any additional expense related to this reduction in force program 
we anticipate these restructuring efforts will generate incremental savings of million in total contract backlog was million at december  compared to million at december  the december  levels include million of backlog from our acquisitions of crts  fyfe na and hockway 
additionally  through our united pipeline systems joint venture  we were awarded a million dollar project in morocco during the fourth quarter of  which is the largest contract ever awarded for our energy and mining segment

the increase in revenues was partially offset by declines in revenues in our european sewer and water rehabilitation segment where in we exited selected  unprofitable contracting markets 
net income from continuing operations was unfavorably impacted in by acquisition related expenses of million and restructuring charges of million 
the restructuring expenses included million  which is classified on the restructuring line of the income statement  and million  which is classified in operating expenses on the income statement 
net income from continuing operations increased million  or  when compared to net income excluding acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges 
consolidated operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was due to the continued growth of our energy and mining and asia pacific sewer and water rehabilitation segments 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by approximately million from our cost reduction measures implemented by our european sewer and water rehabilitation business related to its restructuring 
in  we incurred million of acquisition related expenses 
approximately million of this amount was related to the acquisitions of bayou and corrpro 
we also incurred million in restructuring charges related to our european sewer and water rehabilitation business and the closure of the corrpro paint team operation 
the european restructuring charge was incurred to reorganize the business and position it for profitable growth and to reduce fixed costs 
the reorganization included exiting low return geographies  combining operations and realigning responsibilities and functions in our european headquarters office 
the restructuring charge was comprised of severance  lease termination  asset impairment and legal costs 
the corrpro paint team business  which painted united states navy ships  was non core to our other businesses 
the amount of the charge related to the paint team business was approximately million and was primarily comprised of severance and asset impairment costs

our industrial linings operations experienced growth in all of its geographies and expanded its operations with work in the middle east and africa during we expect improving global markets will lead to expansion within existing geographies as well as new geographies  specifically asia  the middle east and north africa  as evidenced by our recent acquisitions and joint ventures within our corrosion engineering  lining and pipe coating services operations 
our pipe coating operations experienced a lull in availability of large diameter pipe coating projects 
additionally  this segment included million and million of revenues from our recent acquisition of crts june  and hockway august   respectively 
our energy and mining segment contract backlog increased million  or  to million at december  compared to december  we have increased backlog levels across all product lines with the largest growth coming from our industrial linings operations 
in october  through our moroccan industrial linings joint venture  we were awarded a million dollar project  which is the largest contract ever awarded for this segment 
additionally  the increase is due to the inclusion of backlog from our recent acquisitions of crts and hockway of million and million  respectively  as of december  revenues in our energy and mining segment increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to significant growth in our pipe coating and industrial linings operations 
additionally  the increase in revenues was due to the inclusion of a full year of results from our acquisitions of bayou february  and corrpro march  as well as the addition of double joint welding capabilities in the first quarter of and bayou perma pipe canada  ltd  our canadian pipe coating joint venture bppc  in october our energy and mining segment is active in six primary geographic regions the united states  canada  mexico  south america  the middle east and europe  and includes pipeline rehabilitation  pipe coating  design and installation of cathodic protection systems and welding services 
during  each of these product lines experienced growth in revenue 
revenue in our energy and mining segment is responsive to market conditions in the oil  gas and mining industries  however  portions of our energy and mining segment are somewhat insulated from market downturns as they are not entirely dependent on new pipelines or expansion  but rather on rehabilitation and maintenance and the opportunity for our customers to gain increased utilization and capacity through existing assets 
gross profit and gross profit margin our energy and mining segment gross profit increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to our industrial linings operations and the inclusion of gross profit from our recent acquisitions of crts and hockway 
our gross profit margin declined to compared to  due to a change in the geographic mix of our industrial linings operations  which performed more work in south america  where margins are historically lower than other regions due to a larger percentage of non lining work on projects and a change in the product mix in our coating operations  with less large diameter pipe coating projects being performed than the prior year 
we also had a number of larger international projects where margins are lower than in our core north american markets 
we believe our energy and mining segment is positioned for strong growth in due to our recently formed joint venture  ups aptec  which was formed to execute a million project in morocco and usts  which is being formed to execute pipeline  piping and flowline high density polyethylene lining services throughout the middle east and north africa 
additionally  our recent acquisitions of crts and hockway should enhance our market position in the middle east 
finally  our pipe coating operations should experience growth in both revenue and profitability due to the return of the deep water market in the gulf of mexico following the lifting of the offshore drilling moratorium 
bayou wasco  which will allow us to expand our presence in the north american insulation market  should contribute to the energy and mining growth in and beyond 
our energy and mining segment gross profit increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in gross profit year over year was partially due to the inclusion of a full year of results for for our pipe coating and cathodic protection businesses compared to partial years in also  the additions of double joint welding capabilities and bppc contributed to the increase in gross profit 
gross profit margin percentages were strong in all areas of our energy and mining segment  most notably in our pipe coating business 
operating expenses operating expenses in our energy and mining segment increased by million  or  in compared to the primary driver behind the increase in operating expenses was increased costs to support the organization s growth  specifically in new international markets 
additionally  this segment included million and million  respectively  in operating expenses from our recent crts and hockway acquisitions  including million of purchase price depreciation and amortization 
as a percentage of revenues  our energy and mining operating expenses were for and for additionally  we incurred million and million of acquisition related expenses and severance costs during operating expenses in our energy and mining segment increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in operating expenses during was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating expenses related to the expansion of our service offerings within the energy and mining segment of million and increased support and higher corporate allocations due to the growth within the segment

overall  the decreases were primarily due to lower backlog levels and delays in bids and project releases in the eastern and western regions of the united states as well as a higher percentage of small diameter pipe projects 
additionally  we were impacted by continuous severe weather during the early parts of the decreases were partially offset by growth in our canadian operations as well as a million increase in third party tube sales 
contract backlog in our north american sewer and water rehabilitation segment at december  was million 
this represented a million  or  decrease from backlog at december  overall  decreasing levels of backlog are due to weaker market conditions in the united states 
we have reduced our crew and operating resources accordingly so as to minimize excess fixed cost capacity 
we expect a more stable bid table during and are seeing an improvement in the margins of projects in backlog 
revenues increased by in our north american sewer and water rehabilitation segment in to million from million in the prior year 
revenue growth was realized throughout most of our geographic markets  specifically  in the central and eastern regions of the united states

the united kingdom market has shown signs of rebounding from weaker market conditions that persisted over the past few years 
contract backlog in this segment was million at december  this represented a decrease of million  or  compared to december  backlog has improved in france  while market conditions and increased competition have slightly impacted backlog in the netherlands 
our contract backlog is not reflective of anticipated increases in product sales across europe  which have been gaining momentum 
in  revenues in our european sewer and water rehabilitation segment decreased by to million from million in this decrease was due primarily to lower contracting revenues as we exited the contracting markets of belgium  romania and poland 
additionally  we experienced poor market conditions in france and the united kingdom due to depressed economic conditions along with the implementation of austerity measures 
partially offsetting the decline in contracting revenues were increased revenues from our manufacturing facility  driven by increased third party tube sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin gross profit increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in  while gross profit margins declined slightly during the growth from our netherlands operations was primarily at lower margins and we also experienced competitive pressures in switzerland  which reduced our gross profit margin 
the decline in gross profit margin was partially offset by improved performance in france and the united kingdom and increased third party tube sales  which contributed a higher margin 
gross profit declined by million  or  to million in compared to million in due to lower revenue levels coupled with performance issues in france 
however  gross profit margin increased from to due to increased profitability in manufacturing  increased third party tube sales  better project execution  more disciplined cost management across the european business and our exiting less profitable markets

operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for  a reduction of basis points from for  reflecting efficiencies from regional restructuring efforts and continued focus on expense control 
additionally  as part of the overall company restructuring effort  the european sewer and water rehabilitation segment incurred million in the third quarter for severance related costs associated with reduction in force primarily in certain of our united kingdom operations  more specifically its utility construction crews and related support staff  which we anticipate will save the operation approximately million on an annualized basis 
operating expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to  due to the reorganization as well as continued cost reduction efforts across all regions in europe 
as a result of the reorganization in  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of  of which million was recorded in the operating expense line of the income statement

these declines were partially offset by higher revenues in our australian operations 
gross profit in our asia pacific sewer and water rehabilitation segment increased by million  or  in compared to gross profit increased in all regions except india 
the decrease in india was primarily due to revisions made in the cost to complete for two projects 
our gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in as this segment continued to grow into the contracting markets in asia  but also due to the project write downs in india

fyfe na has a comprehensive portfolio of patented and other proprietary technologies and products  including its tyfo fibrwrap system  the first and most comprehensive carbon fiber solution on the market that complies with international building code requirements 
fyfe na s product and service offering also includes pipeline rehabilitation  concrete repair  epoxy injection  corrosion mitigation and specialty coatings services 
the time period represents financial results for the final four months of during  we incurred million of acquisition related expenses for this business as well as current and former acquisition targets 
in connection with the acquisition of fyfe na  we were granted exclusive negotiating rights to acquire fyfe la  fyfe asia and fyfe europe 
in january  we completed the acquisition of fyfe la and we anticipate completing the acquisitions of fyfe asia and fyfe europe during the first and second quarters of  respectively 
backlog at december  for the commercial and structural segment was million  a million  or  increase from september  we anticipate that the commercial and structural segment will generate very strong earnings excluding acquisition related expenditures and top line growth in excluding the acquisition related expenses  our commercial and structural segment generated million in operating income and a operating margin 
this segment has delivered strong gross and operating margins in the four month period following the acquisition due to good performance on pipeline projects 
other income expense interest income and expense interest expense increased by million to million in compared to million in during the third quarter of  we entered into a new million credit facility consisting of a million five year revolving credit line and a million five year term loan facility 
interest expense in included a million make whole payment for our redemption of previously issued senior notes and the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs from our old credit facility 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million in primarily related to a full year of interest expense associated with our acquisitions of bayou and corrpro and the outstanding loan from our bayou joint venture in canada 
interest income was essentially flat in compared to and decreased million to million in compared to million in  due primarily to lower deposit balances throughout the year and lower interest rates on cash balances 
other income expense other income increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in was due to the foreign currency adjustments discussed in note to the financial statements contained in this report and higher foreign currency gains from foreign denominated liabilities on our balance sheet 
other income expense decreased million to million in compared to million in taxes on income our effective tax rate in was  which was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to significant income in jurisdictions with rates lower than the united states 
we expect a slightly higher effective tax rate in due to increased income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates  such as the united states 
our deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets were million  including a million valuation allowance primarily related to foreign net operating losses 
deferred tax assets include million of foreign tax credit carryforwards  of which million has no expiration date  million  will expire in  and million in federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  net of applicable valuation allowances  of which million has no expiration date and million will expire between the years of and our effective tax rate in was and was lower than the federal statutory rate due primarily to the benefit of income in jurisdictions with rates lower than the us rate 
our effective tax rate in any given year is dependent in part on the level of taxable income we generate in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies equity in earnings of affiliated companies was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the results were million less than  primarily due to weaker results at bayou coating  our pipe coating joint venture in baton rouge  and at our german joint venture 
the decrease at bayou coating was due to a reduced volume of large pipe coating projects  while the decrease in our german joint venture was due to more competitive conditions in germany and economic issues in eastern europe 
on june   we acquired the outstanding ownership interests of our joint venture partner  vsl international limited  in insituform hong kong and insituform australia 
for all periods prior to june   these joint ventures were reported as equity in earnings losses of affiliated companies  net of tax 
at june   insituform hong kong and insituform australia were accounted for as fully consolidated entities and are not included in equity in earnings losses of affiliated companies for periods after june  equity losses from insituform hong kong and insituform australia prior to june  were million for noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease during was a result of lower income from our bppc joint venture  partially offset by increased net income of our ups joint ventures 
due to the formation of our recent joint ventures  specifically our united pipeline system joint venture in morocco  which was awarded a million project in late  we anticipate noncontrolling interests to increase in in  noncontrolling interests were partially related to the interest in the net income of insituform linings held by per aarsleff until december in the fourth quarter of  we purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in insituform linings 
loss from discontinued operations revenues from discontinued operations were million and million in and  respectively 
losses from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  were million and million in and  respectively 
the results in discontinued operations were due to the winding down of our tunneling business  which was announced in march the losses and expenses in this segment in were primarily related to legal expenses with respect to certain final tunneling matters 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents december  in thousands cash and equivalents restricted cash in escrow restricted cash held in escrow relates to deposits made in lieu of retention on specific projects performed for municipalities and state agencies or advance customer payments and compensating balances for bank undertakings in europe 
sources and uses of cash we expect the principal operational use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures  potential acquisitions  working capital and debt servicing 
during  capital expenditures were primarily for equipment for bppc  our canadian coating operation  and supporting growth in our energy and mining and asia pacific operations 
we expect increased levels of capital expenditures in compared to primarily for capital requirements in our joint ventures formed in within our energy and mining segment 
at december   our cash balances were located worldwide for working capital and support needs 
given our extensive international operations  approximately of our cash is denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements  however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
with few exceptions  us income taxes  net of applicable foreign tax credits  have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries approximately million as of december  
our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so 
our primary source of cash is operating activities 
we occasionally borrow under our line of credit s available capacity to fund operating activities  including working capital investments 
our operating activities include the collection of accounts receivable as well as the ultimate billing and collection of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings

at december   we had certain net receivables that we believe will be collected but are being disputed by the customer in some manner  which have or may meaningfully impact the timing of collection or require us to invoke our contractual rights to an arbitration or mediation process  or take legal action 
if in a future period we believe any of these receivables are no longer collectible  we would increase our allowance for bad debts through a charge to earnings 
cash flows from operations cash flows from continuing operating activities provided million in compared to million in the decrease in operating cash flow from to was primarily related to lower earnings  but also was impacted by cash payments in associated with our corporate restructuring  acquisition expenses  the make whole payment in connection with the redemption of our senior notes and decreased deferred taxes 
we used million in compared to million in in relation to working capital 
the largest component of our working capital during was a million increase in accounts receivable  retainage and cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
during  we experienced an increase in dsos due primarily to increased customer payable cycles  specifically municipalities  as well as certain isolated projects which have experienced delayed payments 
our dsos from continuing operations increased by days to at december  from at december  during the fourth quarter of  we made improvements in our collection efforts in order to facilitate liquidity 
we lowered our unbilled balances by and our dsos by four days compared to september  we expect strong collections during the first half of as a direct result of these efforts

the entire amount of the term loan was drawn on august  for the following purposes to pay the million cash closing purchase price of our acquisition of the north american business of fyfe group  llc  which transaction closed on august   to retire million in indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit facility  to redeem our million  senior notes  due april  and pay the associated million make whole payment due in connection with the redemption of the senior notes  and to fund expenses associated with the credit facility and the fyfe north america transaction 
as part of the transaction  we paid million in arrangement and commitment fees that will be amortized over the life of the new credit facility 
generally  interest will be charged on the principal amounts outstanding under the new credit facility at the british bankers association libor rate plus an applicable rate ranging from to depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we can opt for an interest rate equal to a base rate as defined in the credit documents plus an applicable rate  which is based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the applicable libor borrowing rate libor plus our applicable rate as of december  was approximately 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  for a notional amount of million  which is set to expire in november the swap notional amount mirrors the amortization of million of our original million term loan from the new credit facility 
the swap requires us to make a monthly fixed rate payment of calculated on the amortizing million notional amount  and provides us a payment based upon a variable monthly libor interest rate calculated on the amortizing million notional amount 
the annualized borrowing rate of the swap at december  was approximately 
the receipt of the monthly libor based payment offsets a variable monthly libor based interest cost on a corresponding million portion of our term loan from the new credit facility 
this interest rate swap is used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the volatility of monthly libor rate movement  and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
on march   we executed a second amendment the second amendment to our prior credit agreement dated march  the old credit facility 
the old credit facility was unsecured and initially consisted of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit  each with a maturity date of march  with the second amendment  we sought to amend the old credit facility to take advantage of lower interest rates available in the debt marketplace  to obtain more favorable loan terms generally and to provide the ability to issue letters of credit with terms beyond the expiration of the original facility 
the second amendment extended the maturity date of the old credit facility from march  to march  and provided us with the ability to increase the amount of the borrowing commitment by up to million in the aggregate compared to million in the aggregate allowed under the old credit facility prior to the second amendment 
the old credit facility was replaced by the new credit facility on august  at june   we borrowed million from the line of credit under the old credit facility in order to fund the purchase of crts  which was subsequently repaid 
see note to the financial statements contained in this report for additional detail regarding this acquisition 
on august   we recorded million of expense related to the write off of unamortized arrangement and up front commitment fees associated with the old credit facility 
on september   we redeemed our outstanding million  senior notes  due april in connection with the redemption  we paid the holders of the senior notes a million make whole payment in addition to the million principal payment 
our total indebtedness at december  consisted of million of the original million term loan from the new credit facility and million of third party notes and other bank debt 
in connection with the formation of bppc  we and perma pipe canada inc  our joint venture partner  loaned the joint venture an aggregate of million for the purchase of capital assets and for operating purposes 
of such amount  million was included in our consolidated financial statements as third party debt as of december  as of december   we had million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under the new credit facility 
of such amount  million was collateral for the benefit of certain of our insurance carriers and million were letters of credit or bank guarantees of performance or payment obligations of foreign subsidiaries 
our new credit facility is subject to certain financial covenants  including a consolidated financial leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we had the capacity to borrow up to approximately million of additional debt under our new credit facility 
the new credit facility also provides for events of default  including  in the event of non payment or certain defaults under other outstanding indebtedness 
see note to the financial statements contained in this report for further discussion on our debt covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  we believe that we have adequate resources and liquidity to fund future cash requirements and debt repayments with cash generated from operations  existing cash balances and additional short and long term borrowing capacity for the next twelve months 
we expect cash generated from operations to improve in due to anticipated increased profitability  improved working capital management initiatives and additional cash flows generated from businesses acquired in disclosure of contractual obligations and commitments we have entered into various contractual obligations and commitments in the course of our ongoing operations and financing strategies 
contractual obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that we are required to make under existing contractual arrangements  such as debt and lease agreements 
these obligations may result from both general financing activities or from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue producing activities 
commercial commitments represent contingent obligations  which become payable only if certain pre defined events were to occur  such as funding financial guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further discussion regarding our commitments and contingencies 
we have entered into several contractual joint ventures in order to develop joint bids on contracts for our installation business 
in these cases  we could be required to complete the joint venture partner s portion of the contract if the partner were unable to complete its portion 
we would be liable for any amounts for which we could not complete the work and for which a third party contractor could not be located to complete the work for the amount awarded in the contract 
while we would be liable for additional costs  these costs would be offset by any related revenues due under that portion of the contract 
we have not experienced any material adverse results from such arrangements 
based on these facts  we currently do not anticipate any future material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows from our contractual joint ventures 
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands 
this table includes cash obligations related to principal outstanding and interest under existing debt arrangements and operating leases 
payments due by period cash obligations total thereafter long term debt and notes payable interest on long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations cash obligations are not discounted 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report regarding our long term debt and credit facility and commitments and contingencies  respectively 
interest on long term debt was calculated using the current annualized rate on our long term debt as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
at december   we had million in earnout liabilities that are expected to be paid out by the end of see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further detail regarding earnout liabilities associated with our acquisitions 
liabilities related to financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  income taxes  have not been included in the table above because we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
there were no material purchase commitments at december  funding for the corrpro pension scheme was excluded from this table as the amounts are immaterial 
off balance sheet arrangements we use various structures for the financing of operating equipment  including borrowings  operating leases and sale leaseback arrangements 
all debt is presented in the balance sheet 
our future commitments were million at december  we also have exposure under performance guarantees by contractual joint ventures and indemnification of our surety 
however  we have never experienced any material adverse effects to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows relative to these arrangements 
at december   our maximum exposure to our joint venture partner s proportionate share of performance guarantees was million 
all of our unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method 
we have no other off balance sheet financing arrangements or commitments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report regarding commitments and contingencies 
critical accounting policies discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement dates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
some accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and costs as construction  engineering and installation contracts progress using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which relies on total expected contract revenues and estimated total costs 
under this method  estimated contract revenues and resulting gross profit margin are recognized based on actual costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenues and gross profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
total estimated costs  and thus contract gross profit  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling and the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  customer needs  customer delays in providing approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics also may affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition and gross profit 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
when current estimates of total contract costs indicate that the contract will result in a loss  the projected loss is recognized in full in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
revenues from change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when it is probable that they will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount can be reliably estimated 
given the uncertainties associated with some of our contracts  it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made 
revisions to estimates could result in the reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from percentage of completion accounting 
many of our contracts provide for termination of the contract at the convenience of the customer 
if a contract is terminated prior to completion  we would typically be compensated for progress up to the time of termination and any termination costs 
in addition  many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances that are within our control 
losses on terminated contracts and liquidated damages have historically not been significant 
bayou is party to certain contracts that provide for multiple value added coating and welding services to customer pipe for use in pipelines in the energy and mining industries  which we consider to be multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for each deliverable as a separate unit of accounting under the accounting guidance of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition fasb asc 
each service  or deliverable  we provide under these contracts could be performed without the other services 
additionally  each service has a readily determined selling price and qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
performance of each of the deliverables is observable due to the nature of the services 
customer inspection typically occurs at the completion of each service before another service is performed 
equity based compensation we record expense for equity based compensation awards  including restricted shares of common stock  performance awards  stock options and stock units  based on the fair value recognition provisions contained in fasb asc  compensation stock compensation fasb asc 
the fair value of stock option awards is determined using an option pricing model that is based on established principles of financial economic theory 
assumptions regarding volatility  expected term  dividend yield and risk free rate are required for valuation of stock option awards 
volatility and expected term assumptions are based on our historical experience 
the risk free rate is based on a us treasury note with a maturity similar to the option award s expected term 
the fair value of restricted stock  restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards is determined using our closing stock price on the award date 
the shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that are awarded are subject to performance and or service restrictions 
we make forfeiture rate assumptions in connection with the valuation of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards that could be different than actual experience 
discussion of our application of fasb asc is described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
taxation we provide for estimated income taxes payable or refundable on current year income tax returns  as well as the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes fasb asc 
fasb asc also requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against any deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized in the future 
the determination is based on our ability to generate future taxable income and  at times  is dependent on our ability to implement strategic tax initiatives to ensure full utilization of recorded deferred tax assets 
should we not be able to implement the necessary tax strategies  we may need to record valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets  including those related to foreign income tax benefits 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in accordance with fasb asc  tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
in addition  this recognition model includes a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with fasb asc this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fasb asc and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december  and were appropriately accounted for in accordance with fasb asc  the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 
we have recorded income tax expense at us tax rates on all profits  except for undistributed profits of non us subsidiaries of approximately million  which are considered indefinitely reinvested 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the indefinitely reinvested profits is not feasible 
a deferred tax asset is recognized only if we have definite plans to generate a us tax benefit by repatriating earnings in the foreseeable future 
goodwill under fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other fasb asc  we assess recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
our annual assessment was last completed as of october  an impairment charge will be recognized to the extent that the implied fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
factors that could potentially trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance of a segment relative to expected  historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the strategy for a segment including extended slowdowns in the segment s market  a decrease in our market capitalization below our book value for an extended period of time  and a significant change in regulations 
our recorded goodwill by reportable segment was as follows at december  in millions energy and mining north american sewer and water rehabilitation european sewer and water rehabilitation asia pacific sewer and water rehabilitation commercial and structural total goodwill in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  we determined the fair value of our reporting units at the annual impairment assessment date and compared such fair value to the carrying value of those reporting units to determine if there were any indications of goodwill impairment 
our reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill are north american sewer and water rehabilitation  european sewer and water rehabilitation  asia pacific sewer and water rehabilitation  ups  bayou  corrpro  crts  hockway and fyfe na 
fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit 
absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction  we believe the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value 
assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections  which are used to project future revenues  earnings and after tax cash flows for each reporting unit 
these assumptions are applied consistently for both methods 
the market approach estimates fair value by first determining earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples for comparable publicly traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit 
the ebitda multiples for comparable companies are based upon current enterprise value 
the enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a control premium 
management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 
the income approach is based on projected future debt free cash flows that are discounted to present value using factors that consider timing and risk of future cash flows 
management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long term operating cash flow performance 
discounted cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections  growth rates  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins  terminal value growth rates  future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements 
estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to business models  changes in our weighted average cost of capital or changes in operating performance 
significant assumptions used in our october goodwill review included i five year compounding annual growth rates generally ranging from to  ii sustained or slightly increased gross margins  iii peer group ebitda multiples  iv terminal values for each reporting unit using a long term growth rate of to  and v discount rates ranging from to 
if actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations  we could incur future impairment charges 
during our assessment of our reporting units fair values in relation to their respective carrying values  we had five reporting units that had a fair value within percent of their carrying value 
the total value of goodwill recorded at the impairment testing date for these reporting units was million 
three of these reporting units within are fyfe na  hockway and crts  all of which were acquired in accordingly  it is expected that their fair values would approximate their carrying values 
the remaining four reporting units had a fair value in excess of of their carrying value 
the total goodwill recorded at the impairment testing date for these reporting units was million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes and of foreign currency and commodity price fluctuations 
we currently do not use derivative contracts to manage commodity risks 
from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to fix exchange rates for net investments in foreign operations to hedge our foreign exchange risk 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december  approximated carrying value 
given the short term nature of these instruments  market risk  as measured by the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates  would not be material 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain fixed rate debt whenever favorable  however  the majority of our debt at december  was variable rate debt 
at december  and  the estimated fair value of our long term debt was approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was estimated using market rates for debt of similar risk and maturity and a discounted cash flow model 
market risk related to the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in our debt specific borrowing rates at december  would result in a million increase in interest expense 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  for a notional amount of million  which is set to expire in november the swap notional amount mirrors the amortization of million of our original million term loan from the new credit facility 
the swap requires us to make a monthly fixed rate payment of calculated on the amortizing million notional amount  and provides us a payment based upon a variable monthly libor interest rate calculated on the amortizing million notional amount 
the receipt of the monthly libor based payment offsets a variable monthly libor based interest cost on a corresponding million portion of our term loan from the new credit facility 
this interest rate swap is used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the volatility of monthly libor rate movement  and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
foreign exchange risk we operate subsidiaries and are associated with licensees and affiliated companies operating solely outside of the united states and in foreign currencies 
consequently  we are inherently exposed to risks associated with the fluctuation in the value of the local currencies compared to the us dollar 
at december   a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents were denominated in foreign currencies  and a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates could result in an approximate million impact to our equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
in order to help mitigate this risk  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not engage in hedging transactions for speculative investment reasons 
there can be no assurance that our hedging operations will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with fluctuating currencies 
at december   there were no material foreign currency hedge instruments outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for additional information and disclosures regarding our derivative financial instruments 
commodity risk we have exposure to the effect of limitations on supply and changes in commodity pricing relative to a variety of raw materials that we purchase and use in our operating activities  most notably resin  iron ore  chemicals  staple fiber  fuel  metals and pipe 
we manage this risk by entering into agreements with certain suppliers utilizing a request for proposal  or rfp  format and purchasing in bulk  and advantageous buying on the spot market for certain metals  when possible 
we also manage this risk by continuously updating our estimation systems for bidding contracts so that we are able to price our products and services appropriately to our customers 
however  we face exposure on contracts in process that have already been priced and are not subject to any cost adjustments in the contract 
this exposure is potentially more significant on our longer term projects 
we obtain a majority of our global resin requirements  one of our primary raw materials  from multiple suppliers in order to diversify our supplier base and thus reduce the risks inherent in concentrated supply streams 
we have qualified a number of vendors in north america  europe and asia that can deliver  and are currently delivering  proprietary resins that meet our specifications 
iron ore inventory balances are managed according to our anticipated volume of concrete weight coating projects 
we obtain the majority of our iron ore from a limited number of suppliers  and pricing can be volatile 
iron ore is typically purchased near the start of each project 
concrete weight coating revenue accounts for a small percentage of our overall revenues 
the primary products and raw materials used by our commercial and structural segment in the manufacture of frp composite systems are carbon  glass  resins  fabric  and epoxy raw materials 
fabric and epoxies are the largest materials purchased  which are currently purchased through a select group of suppliers  although we believe these and the other materials are available from a number of vendors 
the price of epoxy historically is affected by the price of oil 
in addition  a number of factors such as worldwide demand  labor costs  energy costs  import duties and other trade restrictions may influence the price of these raw materials
