index to financial statements adjusted ebitdax  as defined by anadarko  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  anadarko s consolidated adjusted ebitdax should be considered in conjunction with net income loss attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income loss attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities

table of contents 
index to financial statements oil and gas activities anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities 
under this method  acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves 
exploration geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
acquisition costs acquisition costs of unproved properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities 
significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment  based on the company s current exploration plans  and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated 
significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play for example  the greater natural buttes area in the rockies  while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area 
unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis thereby establishing a valuation allowance over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment 
costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance  while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties  as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases  are included in exploration expense 
a majority of the company s unproved property costs are associated with properties acquired in the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions in and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed 
generally  economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests  but may be confirmed by the company s continuing exploration and development programs 
another portion of the company s unproved property costs are associated with the land grant acreage  where the company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage 
a change in the company s expected future plans for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the company s unproved property 
exploratory costs under the successful efforts method of accounting  exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized  or suspended  pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling 
at the end of each quarter  management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities  which includes  for example  analyzing whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or  in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning  analyzing whether development negotiations are underway or proceeding as planned 
if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur  associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed in that period 
therefore  at any point in time  the company may have capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period

index to financial statements proved reserves anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the sec and the fasb 
this definition includes crude oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods  government regulations  etc  ie  at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made 
prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements  and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions 
the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data  as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions  and governmental restrictions  as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier 
a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dd a and could result in property impairments 
fair value the company estimates fair value for derivatives  long lived assets for impairment testing  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing  assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non monetary transactions  guarantees  pension plan assets  initial measurements of aros  and financial instruments that require fair value disclosure  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt 
when the company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  the company utilizes the cost  income  or market valuation approach depending on the quality of information available to support management s assumptions 
the cost approach is based on management s best estimate of the current asset replacement cost 
the income approach is based upon management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
the market approach is based on management s best assumptions regarding prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving comparable assets 
such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput  development and operating costs and the timing thereof  future net cash flows  economic and regulatory climates  and other factors  most of which are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs  and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in the company s business plans and investment decisions 
business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the assets and liabilities of the acquired business to be recorded at fair value 
deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between asset and liability fair value and the tax basis of acquired assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

table of contents 
index to financial statements goodwill at december   the company had billion of goodwill  including million as a result of the wattenberg plant acquisition 
see note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for further discussion of the wattenberg plant acquisition 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at october  or more often as facts and circumstances warrant 
the first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
because quoted market prices for the company s reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests 
management uses all available information to make these fair value estimates  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit  and market multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units 
in estimating the fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit  the company assumes production profiles utilized in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the company s supplemental oil and gas disclosures  market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date adjusted for location and quality differentials  capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates  and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize based upon the risks inherent in anadarko s operations 
for the company s other gathering and processing  wes gathering and processing  and transportation reporting units  the company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected ebitda 
the company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the company s projected ebitda for these reporting units 
a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill 
factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines  cost increases  regulatory or political environment changes  and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market based transactions for similar assets  as well as difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits or other unanticipated events 
based on the most recent goodwill impairment tests  the company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the related reporting unit 
therefore  no impairment was indicated 
environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation  and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability is incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change the company s estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment  and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
the company s in house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and  in certain circumstances  consults with third party legal counsel or consultants to assist in forming the company s conclusion 

table of contents 
index to financial statements impairment of long lived assets a long lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows 
impairment  if any  is measured as the excess of an asset s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
the company utilizes a variety of fair value measurement techniques when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist 
derivative instruments all derivative instruments  other than those that satisfy specific exceptions  are recorded at fair value 
if market quotes are not available to estimate fair value  management s best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or determined through industry standard valuation techniques 
the company s derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over the counter market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments 
option fair values are measured using the black scholes option pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options 
unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded to current earnings 
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded by the company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences  operating losses  and tax credit carryforwards 
the company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and  if required  establishes accruals for such amounts 
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities  including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities  are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances 
although management considers its tax accruals adequate  material changes in these accruals may occur in the future  based on the progress of ongoing tax audits  changes in legislation  and resolution of pending tax matters 
benefit plan obligations the company has non contributory us defined benefit pension plans  including both qualified and supplemental plans  and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan 
the company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
determination of the benefit obligations for the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves many assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for funded pension plans  the rate of future increases in compensation levels of participating employees  and the future level of health care costs 
the company amortizes prior service costs and credits on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under each plan 
actuarial gains and losses that exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under each plan 

table of contents 
index to financial statements discount rate accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of future cash payments 
the company discounts those cash payments using a discount rate that reflects the weighted average of market observed yields for select high quality aa rated fixed income securities with cash flows that correspond to the expected amounts and timing of benefit payments 
discount rate selection for measurements prior to december   was based on a similar cash flow matching analysis  although  instead of using a portfolio of select high quality fixed income securities to determine the effective settlement rate for a given plan obligation  the company relied primarily on a published yield curve derived from market observed yields for a universe of high quality bonds 
both methods are acceptable and result in a discount rate assumption that represents an estimate of the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date 
however  the company believes a discount rate reflecting yields for high quality fixed income securities better corresponds to the company s expectations as to the amount and timing of its benefit payments 
assumed rates of compensation increases for active participants vary by age group 
the weighted average assumed rate weighted by the plan level benefit obligation used to measure the company s december  pension benefit obligations was  and the weighted average discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit obligations  which are longer in duration  was 
expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined using the year end pension investment balances by asset class and expected long term asset allocation 
the expected return for each asset class reflects capital market projections formulated using a forward looking building block approach  while also taking into account historical return trends and current market conditions 
equity returns generally reflect long term expectations of real earnings growth  dividend yield  and inflation 
returns on fixed income securities are generally developed based on expected inflation  real bond yield  and risk spread as appropriate  adjusted for the expected effect that changing yields have on the rate of return 
other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and fixed income markets 
because the assumption reflects the company s expectation of average annualized return over a long time horizon  generally  it is not expected to be significantly revised from year to year  even though actual rates of investment return from year to year often experience significant volatility 
to measure the net periodic pension cost for its funded pension plans  anadarko assumed an average long term rate of return of 
a variation in this assumption of basis points would have changed the measure of net periodic pension cost by approximately million pretax  with higher investment return assumption resulting in lower recognized expense 
rate of compensation increases the company s rate of compensation increases assumption is based on its long term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions 
the assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases  promotions  and general labor cost inflation within the oil and gas industry 
the benefit obligations at december   reflect assumed rates of long term compensation increases for active participants that vary by age group  with the resulting weighted average rate weighted by the plan level benefit obligation of 
health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for  decreasing gradually to in and beyond

index to financial statements recent accounting developments in  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu that permits an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
thus  determining a reporting unit s fair value is not required unless  as a result of a qualitative assessment  it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
this asu is effective for periods beginning after december  adoption of this asu will have no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks are attributable to fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate risk exists due to anticipated foreign currency denominated payments and receipts 
these risks can affect revenues and cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
the company s risk management policies provide for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks 
the types of commodity derivative instruments utilized by the company include futures  swaps  options  and fixed price physical delivery contracts 
the volume of commodity derivatives entered into by the company is governed by risk management policies and may vary from year to year 
both exchange and over the counter traded commodity derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements  and the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements

commodity price risk the company s most significant market risk relates to prices for natural gas  crude oil  and ngls 
management expects energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
as energy prices decline or rise significantly  revenues and cash flows are likewise affected 
in addition  a non cash write down of the company s oil and gas properties or goodwill may be required if commodity prices experience a significant and sustained decline 
below is a sensitivity analysis for the company s commodity price related derivative instruments 
derivative instruments held for non trading purposes the company had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future production of bcf of natural gas at year end the company had a net derivative asset position of million on these derivative instruments at december  based on actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would reduce the fair value of these derivatives by million  while a decrease in underlying commodity prices would increase the fair value of these derivatives by million 
however  any realized derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase  respectively  in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instruments 
derivative instruments held for trading purposes the company had a net derivative asset position of million gains of million and losses of million on derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes at december  based on actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase or decrease in underlying commodity prices would not materially impact the company s gains or losses on these derivative instruments

index to financial statements interest rate risk the company s billion of borrowings under its billion facility are subject to variable interest rates 
the remaining reported balance of anadarko s long term debt in the company s consolidated balance sheets was at fixed interest rates 
the company s billion of libor based obligations  which are presented net of preferred investments in two non controlled entities on the company s consolidated balance sheets  give rise to minimal net interest rate risk exposure because coupons on the related preferred investments are also libor based 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
a increase in libor would not materially impact the company s interest cost on debt already outstanding  but would affect the fair value of outstanding debt  as well as interest cost associated with future debt issuances 
at december   the company had a net derivative liability position of billion related to interest rate swaps 
a increase or decrease in the three month libor interest rate curve would increase or decrease  respectively  the aggregate fair value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements by approximately million 
however  any change in the interest rate derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by an increase or decrease  respectively  in borrowing costs associated with future debt issuances and the company s borrowings under its billion facility 
for a summary of the company s open interest rate derivative positions  see note derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
foreign currency exchange rate risk anadarko s operating revenues are realized in us dollars  and the predominant portion of anadarko s capital and operating expenditures are us dollar denominated 
exposure to foreign currency risk generally arises in connection with project specific contractual arrangements and other commitments 
near term foreign currency denominated expenditures are primarily in euros  brazilian reais  and british pounds sterling 
management periodically enters into transactions to mitigate a portion of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
with respect to international oil and gas development projects  anadarko is a party to contracts containing remaining commitments extending through november that are impacted by euro to us dollar exchange rates 
to manage euro exchange rate risk relative to euro denominated commitments  the company held approximately million  or million  cash and cash equivalents and also held euro us dollar collars during euro purchases mitigate the company s exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate inherent in its existing capital expenditure commitments 
the company also has risk related to exchange rate changes applicable to cash held in escrow pending final determination of the company s brazilian tax liability for its divestiture of the peregrino field offshore brazil 
at december   cash of million was held in escrow 
a increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate would not materially impact the company s gain or loss related to foreign currency
