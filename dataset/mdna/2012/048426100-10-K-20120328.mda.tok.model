item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  comparison of financial condition at december  and  non performing assets 
the following table sets forth the amounts and categories of non performing assets in the bank s loan portfolio at december  dollars in thousands non performing loans real estate one to four family     commercial     other      construction one to four family commercial      acquisition development  other home equity     consumer commercial business   total non performing loans    real estate owned real estate one to four family   commercial     other    construction one to four family  commercial acquisition development other home equity consumer commercial business total real estate owned     total non performing assets    ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing loans to total assets non performing assets to total assets consists of land and multi family loans 
at december   the bank had million in non performing loans  or of total loans 
our largest concentration of non performing loans at december  was million in non performing one to four family residential real estate loans 
at december   six of the non performing one to four family residential real estate loans were jumbo loans loan amount exceeds  totaling million 
due to the decline in real estate values over the last three years  the company believes it is appropriate and prudent to reduce the carrying balance of non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans by the expected loss amount at the time the loan becomes non performing  typically at days past due  rather than providing a general allowance 
accordingly  as of december  our non performing one to four family residential and home equity loan balances were net of million of partial charge offs 
commercial real estate non performing loans of million as of december  were principally comprised of three loan relationships totaling million with specific reserves of million 
the real estate collateral for these loans is either owner occupied with operating businesses or income producing properties 
other non performing real estate loans  consisting of land and multi family real estate loans  totaled million at december  land loans made to two commercial borrowers for the development of residential subdivisions or to purchase single family residential lots for builder inventory comprised million of that total 
we have established a specific allocation of  for these loans which were in the process of foreclosure as of december  non performing commercial real estate construction loans at december  consisted of two loans a million loan participation secured by a condominium hotel project located near disney world in orlando for which we are not the lead lender  is in the process of foreclosure  and the bank recorded a million charge off during and  a  loan for the construction of office condominiums in our jacksonville market 
the loan was in the process of foreclosure  but the borrower continues to market and sell units with two units sold in the fourth quarter of the following table shows the geographic location of our non performing loans by state as of december  florida georgia other states total dollars in thousands non performing loans by state real estate loans one to four family    commercial    other   real estate construction loans one to four family commercial   other other loans home equity    consumer commercial business   total     consists of land and multi family loans 
troubled debt restructurings 
loans for which the terms have been modified as a result of the borrower s financial difficulties are considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
loans modified as tdrs with market rates of interest are classified as impaired loans in the year of restructure and until the loan has performed for months in accordance with the modified terms 
the assessment of market rate of interest for homogenous tdr loans is done based on the weighted average rates of those loans compared to prevailing interest rates at the time of restructure 
tdrs which do not perform in accordance with modified terms are reported as non performing loans 
as of december  and such loans totaled million and  respectively 
tdrs classified as impaired as of december  and were as follows december  dollars in thousands real estate one to four family   commercial   other land multi family   construction construction one to four family construction commercial construction acquisition development other loans home equity   consumer commercial total   the majority of loans modified as tdrs are one to four family residential loans 
since the company has been proactive in attempting to modify residential and home equity loans in early stage delinquency because we believe modifying the loan prior to it becoming non performing results in the least cost to the bank 
the bank also modifies larger commercial and commercial real estate loans as tdrs rather than pursuing other means of collection when it believes the borrower is committed to the successful repayment of the loan and the business operations are likely to support the modified loan terms 
there were no further commitments to customers whose loans were troubled debt restructurings at december  loans which were previously modified as tdrs  are performing in accordance with the modified terms for months or longer and were reported as performing loans as of december  and were as follows december  dollars in thousands real estate one to four family   commercial  other land multi family construction construction one to four family construction commercial construction acquisition development other loans home equity   consumer   commercial total   real estate owned 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned 
at the time of foreclosure or repossession  the property is recorded at estimated fair value less selling costs  with any write down charged against the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   the bank had real estate owned of million  a decrease of million from december  classified assets 
banking regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets  such as other real estate owned  debt and equity securities considered by the bank and regulators to be of lesser quality  as substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered not collectable and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful  it may establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the board of directors 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
in connection with the filing of the bank s regulatory reports with the occ and in accordance with its classification of assets policy  management regularly reviews the problem assets in the portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
the total amount of classified assets consisting primarily of loans and real estate owned represented of the bank s equity capital and of the bank s total assets at december  the aggregate amount of classified assets at the dates indicated was as follows at december  dollars in thousands substandard   doubtful loss total   loans considered doubtful were  at december   an increase of  from  at year end assets considered substandard were million  up from million at year end the bank also designates certain loans as special mention when it is determined a loan relationship should be monitored more closely 
loans are considered as special mention for a variety of reasons including changes in recent borrower financial condition  changes in borrower operations  changes in value of available collateral  concerns regarding changes in economic conditions in a borrower s industry  and other matters 
a loan considered as special mention in many instances may be performing in accordance with the loan terms 
special mention loans were million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december  million of classified loans were on non performing status  as compared to million at year end allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses allowance is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is established as these losses are recognized through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
generally  loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
due to declining real estate values in our markets and the weak united states economy in general  it is increasingly likely that impairment reserves on non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans will not be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss 
as a consequence the company recognizes the charge off of impairment reserves on non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans in the period the loan is classified as such 
this process accelerates the recognition of charge offs but has no impact on the impairment evaluation process 
the reasonableness of the allowance is reviewed and established by management  within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory guidelines  based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the bank s key lending areas 
senior credit officers monitor the conditions discussed above continuously and reviews are conducted quarterly with the bank s senior management and the board of directors 
management s methodology for assessing the reasonableness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include a general loss component by type of loan and specific allowances for identified problem loans 
the allowance also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans 
the general loss component is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk evaluation of the loans or pools of loans 
changes to the risk evaluations relative to both performing and non performing loans affect the amount of this component 
loss factors are based on the bank s recent loss experience  current market conditions that may impact real estate values within the bank s primary lending areas  and on other significant factors that  in management s judgment  may affect the ability to collect loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
other significant factors that exist as of the balance sheet date that may be considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include credit quality trends including trends in non performing loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  geographic foreclosure rates  new and existing home inventories  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments and recent charge off experience in particular segments of the portfolio 
the impact of the general loss component on the allowance began increasing during and has continued to increase during  and the increases reflect the deterioration of market conditions  and the increase in the recent loan experience that has resulted from management s practice of charging off losses on impaired one to four family and home equity loans in the period the impairment is identified 
management also evaluates the allowance for loan losses based on a review of certain large balance individual loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows management expects to receive on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
for all specifically reviewed loans where it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement  impairment is determined by computing a fair value based on either discounted cash flows using the loan s initial interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as individual consumer and residential loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and are excluded from the specific impairment evaluation 
for these loans  the allowance for loan losses is calculated in accordance with the general allowance for loan losses policy described above 
accordingly  except for loans modified as troubled debt restructuring  we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of the total loan portfolio and of total non performing loans 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective and requires making material estimates  including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses represents all known and inherent loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimated as of december  the following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the years indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year    charge offs real estate loans one to four family     commercial     other land multi family   real estate construction loans construction one to four family construction commercial  acquisition development other loans home equity     consumer      commercial total charge offs     recoveries real estate loans one to four family commercial other land multi family real estate construction loans construction one to four family construction commercial acquisition development other loans home equity consumer  commercial total recoveries    net charge offs     provision for loan losses    balance at end of year    net charge offs to average loans during this year net charge offs to average non performing loans during this year allowance for loan losses to non performing loans allowance as of total loans end of year total loans are net of deferred fees and costs and purchase premiums or discounts 
loan charge offs in and included million and million  respectively  of partial charge offs of non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans  representing the expected loss amount at the time the loans became non performing 
due to delays in the foreclosure process and declining real estate values in florida  additional losses on these loans may be incurred in the future if the bank is unable to reach timely settlement with the borrower or the loan is sold in a distressed asset sale

the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses on loans by loan category at the dates indicated

the bank is required by federal regulations to maintain an amount of liquid assets  such as cash and short term securities  for the purposes of meeting operational needs 
the bank is also permitted to make certain other securities investments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and commitments 
cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is provided 
the bank is authorized to invest in various types of liquid assets  including us treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises  certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions  certain bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements and federal funds 
subject to various restrictions  federal savings associations may also invest their assets in investment grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally chartered savings association is otherwise authorized to make directly 
see supervision and regulation for a discussion of additional restrictions on the bank s investment activities 
the board of directors has adopted an investment policy which governs the nature and extent of investment activities  and the responsibilities of management and the board 
investment activities are directed by the chief financial officer and the treasurer in coordination with the company s asset liability committee 
various factors are considered when making decisions  including the marketability  maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment 
the maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions  including the current and anticipated short and long term interest rates  the level of interest rates  the trend of new deposit inflows  and the anticipated demand for funds through deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases 
the structure of the investment portfolio is intended to provide liquidity when loan demand is high  assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and maximize earnings while managing risk  including credit risk  reinvestment risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset and liability management and market risk 
investment securities 
the bank invests in investment securities  for example united states government sponsored enterprises and state and municipal obligations  as part of its asset liability management strategy 
gaap requires investments be categorized as held to maturity  trading securities or available for sale  based on management s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security 
securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before maturity 
all of the bank s securities are classified as available for sale 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment otti at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
in evaluating otti  management considers many factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions  and whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
the assessment of whether an other than temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the bank intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss 
if the bank intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the otti recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the bank does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
as of december   the company s security portfolio consisted of securities  of which were in an unrealized loss position 
nearly all unrealized losses are related to debt securities whose underlying collateral is residential mortgages 
however  the majority of these securities were issued by government sponsored organizations as discussed below 
at december   approximately million  or of the debt securities held by the company were issued by us government sponsored entities and agencies  primarily fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support 
because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity  and not credit quality  and because the company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery  the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the bank recorded other than temporary impairment charges of  during see also the item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securities available for sale 
these charges represented credit losses from our investments in non agency collateralized mortgage obligations  caused by defaults and losses on the underlying mortgages 
as of december  the bank held no non agency collateralized mortgages

the bank s sources of funds are deposits  payment of principal and interest on loans  interest earned on or maturation of investment securities  borrowings  and funds provided from operations 
deposits 
the bank offers a variety of deposit accounts to consumers with a wide range of interest rates and terms 
deposits consist of time deposit accounts  savings  money market and demand deposit accounts 
the bank s origin as a credit union enables it to enjoy the benefit of long term deposit customers 
as a community bank the bank has historically paid higher rates on deposit accounts than large regional or national banks 
the bank relies primarily on competitive pricing policies  marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
additionally  the bank has purchased time deposit accounts from brokers at costs and terms which are comparable or better to time deposits originated in the branch offices 
the bank had million of brokered deposits at december   which was of total deposits 
see supervision and regulation regulatory agreements with the office of thrift supervision supervisory agreements for additional restrictions on our ability to accept brokered deposits 
the variety of deposit accounts offered has allowed the bank to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand 
pricing of deposits are managed to be consistent with overall asset liability management  liquidity and growth objectives 
management considers numerous factors including the need for funds based on loan demand  current maturities of deposits and other cash flow needs  rates offered by market area competitors for similar deposit products  current cost of funds and yields on assets  and the alternative cost of funds on a wholesale basis  in particular the cost of advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
interest rates are reviewed regularly by senior management as a part of its asset liability management actions 
based on historical experience  management believes the bank s deposits are a relatively stable source of funds 
despite this stability  the bank s ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions

although deposits are the primary source of funds  the bank may utilize borrowings when it is a less costly source of funds  and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread  when additional capacity is required to fund loan demand or when they meet asset liability management goals 
borrowings have historically consisted primarily of advances from the fhlb of atlanta  however the bank also has the ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank frb of atlanta 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
advances from the fhlb of atlanta may be obtained upon the security of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
these advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate  range of maturities and call features 
at december   the company had million in fhlb advances outstanding

supervision and regulation general atlantic coast bank is examined and supervised by the occ and is subject to examination by the fdic 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance fund and depositors 
under this system of federal regulation  financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy  assets  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates 
following completion of its examination  the federal agency critiques the institution s operations and assigns its rating known as an institution s camels rating 
under federal law  an institution may not disclose its camels rating to the public 
atlantic coast bank also is a member of and owns stock in the federal home loan bank of atlanta  which is one of the twelve regional banks in the federal home loan bank system 
atlantic coast bank is also regulated to a lesser extent by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters 
the occ examines atlantic coast bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any operating deficiencies 
atlantic coast bank s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated to a great extent by federal law and  to a much lesser extent  state law  especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of atlantic coast bank s mortgage documents 
any change in these laws or regulations  whether by the fdic  the occ or congress  could have a material adverse impact on atlantic coast financial corporation and atlantic coast bank and their operations 
under the recently enacted dodd frank act  the ots functions relating to federal savings associations  including rulemaking authority  were transferred to the comptroller of the currency 
the thrift charter has been preserved and a new deputy comptroller of the currency will supervise and examine federal savings associations and savings banks 
at the same time  responsibility for the regulation and supervision of savings and loan holding companies was transferred to the federal reserve  which supervises bank holding companies 
as a savings and loan holding company  atlantic coast financial corporation is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the federal reserve  and is required to file certain reports with and is subject to examination by the federal reserve 
atlantic coast financial corporation is also subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission under the federal securities laws 
set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to atlantic coast financial corporation and atlantic coast bank 
the description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed  and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on atlantic coast financial corporation and atlantic coast bank 
regulatory agreements with the ots supervisory agreements 
effective december   the company  the bank and the ots entered into supervisory agreements 
the supervisory agreements have been assumed by the occ as to restrictions that relate to the bank and by the federal reserve as to restrictions that relate to the company 
the agreements provide  among other things  that the bank must not purchase additional bank owned life insurance boli or increase its investment in existing boli policies until the bank s boli exposure is within regulatory guidelines of of total capital  the bank must comply with regulations limiting its ability to accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits without receiving the written non objection of the ots  including reducing its level of brokered deposits to million by june   the bank and the company must comply with regulatory prior notification requirements with respect to changes in directors and senior executive officers  the bank will not be permitted to declare a dividend or make any other capital distributions without the prior written approval of the ots  and the company cannot declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions without prior written ots approval  the bank and the company will not be permitted to enter into  renew  extend or revise any contractual arrangement relating to compensation or benefits for any senior executive officers or directors  unless it provides days prior written notice of the proposed transaction to the ots  the bank may not enter into any arrangement or contract with a third party service provider that is significant to the financial condition of the bank or outside of its normal course of business unless the ots has received days prior written notice of such contract or arrangement and issued its written non objection  the bank and the company may not make any golden parachute payment or prohibited indemnification payment without ots prior written approval  the bank will not be permitted to increase its total assets during any quarter in excess of an amount equal to the net interest credited on deposit liabilities during the prior quarter  without the prior written non objection of the ots  the bank may not engage in any transactions with affiliates without providing days advance written notice to the ots and receiving its written non objection  and the company may not incur  issue  renew or rollover any debt or debt securities  increase any current lines of credit  guarantee the debt of any entity  or otherwise incur any additional debt without the prior written non objection of the ots 
imcr 
the ots the predecessor regulatory agency to the occ established an imcr with the bank on may  that required that the bank to achieve a tier core capital ratio of as of june  and as of september  while we achieved the required tier core capital ratio as of june   the bank was not in compliance with the imcr as of september   and as of december  had a tier core capital ratio of 
the occ has the authority to subject the bank to more restrictive enforcement orders including cease and desist orders  formal actions or other directives that may require the bank to meet and maintain capital levels at amounts higher than the imcr 
memorandum of understanding 
in august  atlantic coast bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the ots addressing certain areas of its operations 
this memorandum has been superseded by the supervisory agreements 
new federal legislation congress has enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act which has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act eliminated the bank s former primary federal regulator  the ots  and requires atlantic coast bank to be regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the primary federal regulator for national banks 
the dodd frank act also authorizes the board of governors of the federal reserve system to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies like atlantic coast financial corporation in addition to bank holding companies which it currently regulates 
the dodd frank act also requires the federal reserve board to set minimum capital levels for all depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries  and the components of tier capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be tier capital for insured depository institutions 
under the dodd frank act  the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from tier capital unless such securities were issued prior to may  by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than billion of assets 
savings and loan holding companies are subject to a five year transition period before the holding company capital requirement will apply 
the legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives 
the dodd frank act also created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as atlantic coast bank  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators 
the new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations  and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
the legislation also broadened the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  the dodd frank act requires companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and change in control payments 
the legislation also directs the federal reserve board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
further  the legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans  directs the federal reserve board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage origination 
many of the provisions of dodd frank involve delayed effective dates and or require implementing regulations 
accordingly  it will be some time before management can assess the full impact on operations 
however  there is a significant possibility that the dodd frank act will  at a minimum  result in an increased regulatory burden and compliance  operating and interest expense for atlantic coast bank and atlantic coast financial corporation 
federal banking regulation business activities 
a federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act  as amended  and the regulations of the occ 
under these laws and regulations  atlantic coast bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and nonresidential real estate  commercial business loans and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets  subject to applicable limits

capital distributions 
occ regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank  which include cash dividends  stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account 
a savings bank must file an application for approval of a capital distribution if the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings bank s net income for that year to date plus the savings bank s retained net income for the preceding two years  the savings bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution  the distribution would violate any applicable statute  regulation  agreement or occ imposed condition  or the savings bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings 
even if an application is not otherwise required  every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the federal reserve at least days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution 
the occ or federal reserve may disapprove a notice or application if the savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution  if after making such distribution the institution would be undercapitalized 
liquidity 
a federal savings bank is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation 
community reinvestment act and fair lending laws 
all savings banks have a responsibility under the community reinvestment act and related regulations of the occ to help meet the credit needs of their communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in connection with its examination of a federal savings bank  the occ is required to assess the association s record of compliance with the community reinvestment act 
in addition  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes 
an association s failure to comply with the provisions of the community reinvestment act could  at a minimum  result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers  or in restrictions on its activities 
the failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in enforcement actions by the occ  as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the department of justice 
atlantic coast bank received a satisfactory community reinvestment act rating in its most recent federal examination 
transactions with related parties 
a federal savings bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by occ regulations and by sections a and b of the federal reserve act and its implementing regulation w 
an affiliate is a company that controls  is controlled by  or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as atlantic coast bank 
atlantic coast financial corporation will be an affiliate of atlantic coast bank 
in general  loan transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliate are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements 
in this regard  transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliate are limited to of the institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions with any one affiliate and of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates 
collateral in specified amounts ranging from to of the amount of the transaction must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the association 
in addition  occ regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate  other than a subsidiary 
finally  transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices  not involve low quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
the occ requires savings banks to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates 
atlantic coast bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers and stockholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the federal reserve act and regulation o of the federal reserve board 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders i be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features  and ii not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of atlantic coast bank s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by atlantic coast bank s board of directors 
atlantic coast bank is in compliance with regulation o 
enforcement 
the occ has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all institution affiliated parties  including stockholders  attorneys  appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution 
formal enforcement action by the occ may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order  to removal of officers and or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions  and range up to  per day  unless a finding of reckless disregard is made  in which case penalties may be as high as million per day 
the fdic also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the occ that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution 
if action is not taken by the occ  the fdic has authority to take action under specified circumstances 
standards for safety and soundness 
federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions 
these standards relate to  among other things  internal controls  information systems and audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  compensation  and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate 
the federal banking agencies adopted interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines address internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  credit underwriting  loan documentation  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines  the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan 
prompt corrective action regulations 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the occ is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the savings bank s capital well capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  adequately capitalized at least leverage capital for savings banks with a composite examination rating of  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  undercapitalized less than leverage capital for savings banks with a composite examination rating of  tier risk based capital or total risk based capital  significantly undercapitalized less than total risk based capital  tier risk based capital or leverage capital  or critically undercapitalized less than tangible capital 
generally  the occ is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that is critically undercapitalized within specific time frames 
the regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the occ within days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
the criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include  among other things  the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis  procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations  the identification of the types and levels of activities the savings bank will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect  and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the savings bank 
any holding company for the savings bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to of a savings bank s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the occ  or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status 
this guarantee remains in place until the occ notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters  and the occ has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee 
failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the savings bank  such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends  pay executive compensation and management fees  and increase assets or expand operations 
the occ may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks  including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors

insurance of deposit accounts 
atlantic coast bank is a member of the deposit insurance fund  which is administered by the fdic 
deposit accounts in the bank are insured by the fdic 
in view of the recent economic crisis  the fdic temporarily increased the general individual deposit insurance available on deposit accounts from  to  the dodd frank act made that level of coverage permanent retroactive to january  in addition  pursuant to a provision of the dodd frank act  certain non interest bearing transaction accounts are fully insured regardless of the dollar amount until december  the fdic imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions 
under the fdic s risk based assessment system  insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by fdic regulations  with institutions deemed less risky paying lower rates 
assessment rates inclusive of possible adjustments currently range from to basis points of each institution s total assets less tangible capital 
the fdic may increase or decrease the scale uniformly  except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking 
the fdic s current system represents a change  effective april  and required by the dodd frank act  from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution s volume of deposits 
in  the fdic  in response to pressures on the deposit insurance fund caused by bank and savings association failures  required all insured depository institutions to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of  and the estimated assessments were based on assumptions established by the fdic  including an assumed annual growth rate and certain assumed assessment rate increases 
that pre payment  which was due on december  and amounted to million for atlantic coast bank  was recorded as a prepaid expense at december  and is being amortized to expense over three years 
any unused prepaid assessments would be returned to the institution in june the dodd frank act increased the minimum target deposit insurance fund ratio from of estimated insured deposits to of estimated insured deposits 
the fdic must seek to achieve the ratio by september  insured institutions with assets of billion or more are supposed to fund the increase 
the dodd frank act eliminated the maximum fund ratio  instead leaving it to the discretion of the fdic and the fdic has exercised that discretion by establishing a long term fund ratio of 
the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of atlantic coast bank 
management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
we do not currently know of any practice  condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance 
in addition to the fdic assessments  the financing corporation fico is authorized to impose and collect  with the approval of the fdic  assessments for anticipated payments  issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the fico in the s to recapitalize the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation

if the bank s non performing assets increase  the bank s earnings will suffer 
at december   our non performing assets totaled million  or of total assets  and have increased steadily since december   when non performing assets were million or of total assets 
our non performing assets may continue to increase in future periods 
our non performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways 
we do not record interest income on non performing loans or real estate owned 
we must establish an allowance for loan losses for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable through current period provisions for loan losses  which are recorded as a charge to income 
from time to time  we also write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values 
additionally  there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes  insurance and maintenance related to other real estate owned 
further  the resolution of non performing assets requires the active involvement of management  which can distract them from our overall supervision of operations and other income producing activities

the individual agreements take the form of term repurchase agreements with maturities beginning in and final maturities in the interest rate terms are variable based on an index tied to month libor or the counterparty has an option to lock in interest rates at a fixed rate each quarter 
due to the low libor interest rate environment that has existed over the last two years  each of the counterparties has exercised their options to fix the rate at ceiling maximums 
the weighted average rate of the reverse repos as of december  was  and the weighted average maturity was months 
due to the unusually low long term interest rate environment being promoted by the federal reserve  yields on the investment securities collateralizing the reverse repos have been decreasing and at december  the weighted average yield on these securities was approximately 
given the announced intentions of the federal reserve to hold interest rates at their current levels until  the reverse repo transactions are expected to have a negative impact to our net interest margin and represent a barrier to returning to profitability 
the bank has the option to terminate the reverse repos at the market rate of the debt 
as of december   the market rate of the debt exceeded the principal balance outstanding by million 
the agreements with the counterparty of the million reverse repo contain default conditions which if triggered would materially impact the bank s capital and results of operations

as of december  the market rate of the debt exceeded the principal balance outstanding by million 
the company has experienced net losses for each of the last three fiscal years and we may not return to profitability in the near future 
the company has experienced net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the losses have been primarily caused by a significant increase in non performing assets  which necessitated a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  we charged off million of loans during the year ended december   million of loans during and million of loans during non performing loans generally loans days or more past due in principal or interest payments increased to million  or of total loans at december   compared to million  or of total loans at december  we experienced other than temporary impairment losses in our investment portfolio of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  during the year ended december   management deemed it appropriate to write off our entire goodwill balance of million  and establish a valuation allowance of of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result of these factors and other conditions such as weakness in our local economy  we may not be able to generate sustainable net income or achieve profitability in the near future 
we may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy and as a result  our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 
our future success will depend upon management s ability to successfully implement its business strategy  which includes expanding warehouse lending  an emphasis on originating loans to small businesses  including loans guaranteed by the united states small business administration  expense reduction and transitioning the bank to a retail community banking model 
while we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully implement our strategy  it will take time and additional capital to fully implement our strategy 
we expect that it may take a significant period of time before we can achieve the intended results of our business strategy 
during the period we are implementing our plan our results of operations may be negatively impacted 
in addition  even if our strategy is successfully implemented  it may not produce positive results 
additionally  future success in the expansion of the warehouse and small business lending platforms as well as the ongoing development of the retail community banking model will depend on management s ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated employees 
an improving job market along with competition for banking talent from institutions with greater financial resources could negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain adequate talent and adversely affect our business and profitability 
future capital raises are subject to regulatory approval which could slow down or prevent timely acquisition of additional capital 
under conditions established by the ots upon approval of the company s second step conversion  the company must obtain approval of any stock offering public or private conducted for months after the completion of the second step conversion on february  from the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
in addition  without prior approval from the federal reserve bank of atlanta the company is prohibited from selling more than a ownership interest in the company for three years following the second step conversion 
the geographic concentration in loans secured by one to four family residential real estate may increase credit losses  which could increase the level of provision for loan losses 
as of december   approximately of the total loan portfolio was secured by first or second liens on one to four family residential property  primarily in southeastern georgia and northeastern florida 
the bank had million  or  of our loan portfolio secured by one to four family residential property in florida and million  or  of such properties in georgia 
the downturn in the local and national economy beginning in  through  particularly affecting real estate values and employment  have adversely affected our loan customers ability to repay their loans 
in the event we are required to foreclose on a property securing a mortgage loans or pursue other remedies in order to protect our investment  we may not be able to recover funds in an amount equal to any remaining loan balance as a result of prevailing economic conditions  real estate values and other factors associated with the ownership of real property 
in particular  the foreclosure process in florida often takes up to years to complete  thereby potentially increasing our risk of loss due to the property s deterioration in value during this period 
as a result  the market value of the real estate or other collateral underlying the loans may not  at any given time  be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
consequently  we would sustain loan losses and potentially incur a higher provision for loan loss expense 
the loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our number of commercial real estate  commercial business  construction and multi family loans and consumer loans  which could increase the level of provision for loan losses 
the outstanding commercial real estate  commercial business  construction  multi family  and manufactured home  automobile and other consumer loans accounted for approximately of the total loan portfolio as of december  generally  management considers these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on one to four family  owner occupied residential properties 
historically  these loans have had higher risks than loans secured by residential real estate for the following reasons commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
this risk has been exacerbated by the extended recession in commercial real estate and commercial land values  particularly in our markets 
commercial and multi family construction loans 
repayment is dependent upon the completion of the project and income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
single family construction loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful completion of the project and the ability of the contractor or builder to repay the loan from the sale of the property or obtaining permanent financing 
multi family real estate loans 
repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as automobile and manufactured home loans are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan due to depreciation  damage or loss 
if these non residential loans become non performing  we may have to increase our provision for loan losses which would negatively affect our results of operations 
the loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to portfolio lending during a period of rising real estate values  high sales volume activity and historically low interest rate environment 
much of the bank s portfolio lending is in one to four family residential properties generally located throughout southeastern georgia and northeastern florida 
as a result of lending during a period of rising real estate values and historically low interest rates  a significant portion of the loan portfolio is potentially under collateralized given the recent significant decline in real estate values 
sufficient time has not elapsed to ascertain the magnitude of potential losses resulting from lending during a period of intense changes in the real estate market 
additionally  given the historically low interest rate environment over this same period  the adjustable rate loans have not been subject to an interest rate environment that causes them to adjust to the maximum level and may involve repayment risks resulting from potentially increasing payment obligations by borrowers as a result of re pricing 
at december   there were million in adjustable rate loans  which made up of the loan portfolio 
high loan to value ratios on a portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio expose us to greater risk of loss 
many of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because of the decline in home values in our market areas 
the pressure on home values has increased due to the uncertainty caused by the us government s lawsuit against larger national loan servicers and the impact of distressed asset sales by us government agency mortgage lenders 
residential loans with high loan to value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan to value ratios and  therefore  may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses 
in addition  if the borrowers sell their homes  such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale 
as a result  these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses 
if the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses  income and capital will be negatively affected 
the bank s allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans  at december  in the event loan customers do not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral security for the payments of these loans is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  the bank may experience significant loan losses 
such credit risk is inherent in the lending business  and failure to adequately assess such credit risk could have a material adverse affect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of the borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of the loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  management reviews the loan portfolio and our historical loss and delinquency experience  as well as overall economic conditions 
for larger balance non homogeneous real estate loans the estimate of impairment is based on the underlying collateral if collateral dependent  and if such loans are not collateral dependent  the estimate of impairment is based on a cash flow analysis 
if management s assumptions are incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio  resulting in additions to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is also periodically reviewed by the office of the comptroller of the currency  who may require us to increase the amount 
additions to the allowance for loans losses would be made through increased provisions for loan losses and would negatively affect our results of operations 
interest rate volatility could significantly reduce the bank s profitability 
the bank s earnings largely depend on the relationship between the yield on its earning assets  primarily loans and investment securities  and the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings 
this relationship  commonly known as the net interest margin  is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors that influence the yields and rates  and the volume and mix of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk arises from the imbalance in the re pricing  maturity and or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities 
the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest earning assets 
significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
the bank s interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re pricing and cash flow attributes of its balance sheet and off balance sheet instruments as they relate to current and potential changes in interest rates 
the level of interest rate risk  measured in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income  is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques under multiple interest rate scenarios 
management s objectives are to measure  monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in the bank s balance sheet 
future changes in interest rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the federal reserve board maintained the federal funds rate at the historically low rate of during and the federal funds rate has a direct correlation to general rates of interest  including our interest bearing deposits 
our mix of asset and liabilities are considered to be sensitive to interest rate changes 
generally  customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time 
the speed at which such prepayments occur  as well as the amount of such prepayments  are within bank customers discretion 
if customers prepay the principal amount of their loans  and the bank is unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates  the bank s interest income will be reduced 
a significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
on the other hand  if interest rates rise  net interest income might be reduced because interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits  increases more quickly than interest received on interest earning assets  including loans and mortgage backed and related securities 
in addition  rising interest rates may negatively affect income because higher rates may reduce the demand for loans and the value of mortgage related and investment securities 
the bank has million in long term borrowings  comprised of million of fhlb advances and million of reverse repurchase agreements  with the earliest maturities beginning in and final maturities occurring in the weighted average rate of the long term borrowings as of december  was  and accounted for approximately of interest expense for the year ended december  given the announced intentions of the federal reserve bank to hold interest rates at their current levels until  the long term borrowings are expected to have a negative impact to the net interest margin 
operating expenses are high as a percentage of our net interest income and non interest income  making it more difficult to maintain profitability 
non interest expense  which consists primarily of the costs associated with operating our business  represents a high percentage of the income we generate 
the cost of generating our income is measured by our efficiency ratio  which represents non interest expense divided by the sum of our net interest income and our non interest income 
if we are able to lower our efficiency ratio  our ability to generate income from our operations will be more effective 
for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and  our efficiency ratio was  and  respectively 
generally  this means we spent  and during the years ended  and to generate of income if economic conditions continue to deteriorate or the economic recovery remains slow over an extended period of time in our primary market areas of jacksonville  florida and ware county  georgia  our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted as borrowers ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases 
financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including decreases in real estate values  changes in interest rates  which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads  adverse employment conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and the georgia and florida state governments and other significant external events 
we held approximately of the deposits in ware county  the county in which waycross  georgia is located as of december  we also have approximately of the deposits in the jacksonville  florida  metropolitan area as of december  additionally  our market share of loans in ware county is significantly greater than our share of the loan market in the jacksonville metropolitan area 
as a result of the concentration in ware county  we may be more susceptible to adverse market conditions in that market 
due to the significant portion of real estate loans in the loan portfolio  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
at december   million  or  of our loan portfolio consisted of real estate secured loans in florida and million  or  of such loans consisted of real estate secured loans in georgia 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on earnings 
the unemployment rate for the jacksonville  florida metropolitan area was an estimated as of december  the united states economy remains weak and unemployment levels are high 
continuing economic weakness  particularly in our geographic market area  will adversely affect our business and financial results 
the united states experienced a severe economic recession in and  the effects of which have continued through recent growth has been slow and unemployment remains at high levels and as a result economic recovery is expected to be slow 
loan portfolio quality has deteriorated at many financial institutions reflecting  in part  the weak united states economy and high unemployment rates 
in addition  the value of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages has declined and may continue to decline 
the real estate downturn also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing and increased delinquencies in construction  residential and commercial mortgage loans 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have declined substantially  and it is significantly more difficult for banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow funds 
future negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the market for and value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
we could experience reduced demand for our products and services  increases in loan delinquencies  problem assets or foreclosures  and the collateral for our loans may decline further in value 
moreover  future declines in the stock market in general  or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically  could adversely affect our stock performance 
the slowing and uncertain economy in florida has negatively impacted our ability to grow loans in our primary market area  and combined with strong competition  may further reduce our ability to obtain loans and also decrease our yield on loans 
from to mid  the jacksonville metropolitan area had been one of the fastest growing economies in the united states 
the area experienced substantial growth in population  new business formation and public works spending 
due to the considerable slowing of economic growth and migration into our market area since mid and the resulting downturn in the real estate market  management believes growth in our market area will be moderate in the near term 
growth in the first mortgage loan portfolio has been negatively impacted by a slowing in existing and new home sales activity in our markets 
a decrease in existing and new home sales decreases lending opportunities  and may negatively affect our income 
in addition  we are located in a competitive market that affects our ability to obtain loans through origination or purchase as well as originating them at rates that provide an attractive yield 
competition for loans comes principally from mortgage bankers  commercial banks  other thrift institutions  nationally based homebuilders and credit unions 
internet based lenders have also become a greater competitive factor in recent years 
such competition for the origination and purchase of loans may limit future growth and earnings prospects 
strong competition in our primary market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and also increase our cost of funds 
the bank operates in a very competitive market for the attraction of deposits  the primary source of our funding 
historically  our most direct competition for deposits has come from credit unions  community banks  large commercial banks and thrift institutions within our primary market areas 
in recent years competition has also come from institutions that largely deliver their services over the internet 
such competitors have the competitive advantage of lower infrastructure costs and substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer services we do not provide 
particularly during times of extremely low or extremely high interest rates  we have faced significant competition for investors funds from short term money market securities and other corporate and government securities 
during periods of regularly increasing interest rates  competition for interest bearing deposits increases as customers  particularly time deposit customers  tend to move their accounts between competing businesses to obtain the highest rates in the market 
as a result  atlantic coast bank incurs a higher cost of funds in an effort to attract and retain customer deposits 
we strive to grow our lower cost deposits  such as non interest bearing checking accounts  in order to reduce our cost of funds 
the company may not be able to realize our deferred tax asset 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
however  at december   we had no net deferred tax asset 
in  we established a valuation allowance for our net federal and state deferred tax asset after evaluating the positive and negative evidence under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires more weight be given to objective evidence  and since realization is dependent on future operating results  our three year cumulative operating loss carried more weight than forecasted earnings 
management regularly reviews the deferred tax asset for recoverability based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences 
realization of the deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income  including taxable income in prior carryback years  as well as future taxable income 
the net deferred tax asset at december  will not become fully realizable until our expected future earnings will support realization of the asset 
in addition  future capital raises or transactions that result in a change in control could trigger the application of certain tax laws which materially limit the utilization of deferred tax asset 
this is a complex analysis and requires us to make certain judgments in determining the annual limitation 
although it is currently not shown as an asset  it is possible that we could ultimately lose a significant portion of the deferred tax asset 
realization of our deferred tax asset would significantly improve our earnings and capital 
wholesale funding sources may be unavailable to replace deposits at maturity and support our liquidity needs or growth 
the bank must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers 
as a part of our liquidity management  we use a number of funding sources in addition to non maturity deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments 
ongoing financial difficulties and restrictions by the occ may limit these sources  which include federal home loan bank advances  proceeds from the sale of loans and liquidity resources of the holding company 
at december   we had million of federal home loan bank advances outstanding  and the remaining borrowing capacity was million 
in the past brokered deposits have been solicited as a source of funds 
however  under the supervisory agreement with the office of thrift supervision entered into in december  atlantic coast bank had to reduce the level of its brokered deposits to million by june  we had million of brokered deposits at december   which was of total deposits 
as our brokered deposits mature  we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources 
not being able to replace those deposits as they mature could adversely affect our liquidity 
paying higher interest rates to replace those deposits could adversely affect our net interest margin and our operating results 
our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates 
if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in this case  our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected 
atlantic coast bank operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
atlantic coast bank is currently subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation  which insures atlantic coast bank s deposits 
as a savings and loan holding company  atlantic coast financial corporation is currently subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which financial institutions and their holding companies may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operations of financial institutions  the classification of assets by financial institutions and the adequacy of financial institutions allowance for loan losses 
new financial reform legislation was enacted in by congress that will change the bank regulatory framework  create an independent consumer protection bureau that will assume the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies  and establish more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies 
the legislation will also result in new regulations affecting the lending  funding  trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies 
further changes in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  could have a material impact on atlantic coast bank and atlantic coast financial corporation 
atlantic coast bank s operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal  state and local governmental authorities  and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions that impose requirements and restrictions on operations 
these laws  rules and regulations are frequently changed by legislative and regulatory authorities 
in the future  changes to existing laws  rules and regulations  or any other new laws  rules or regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition or prospects 
financial reform legislation enacted by congress eliminated the office of thrift supervision and  among other things  will tighten capital standards  created a new consumer financial protection bureau and will result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act in july  which significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act eliminated our previous primary federal regulator  the office of thrift supervision  and required atlantic coast bank to be regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the primary federal regulator for national banks 
the dodd frank act also authorized the board of governors of the federal reserve system to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies like atlantic coast financial corporation  in addition to bank holding companies which it currently regulates 
as a result  the federal reserve board s current regulations applicable to bank holding companies  including holding company capital requirements  apply to savings and loan holding companies like atlantic coast financial corporation 
these capital requirements are substantially similar to the capital requirements currently applicable to atlantic coast bank  but will not be applicable to atlantic coast financial corporation for five years 
the dodd frank act also required the federal reserve board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries  and the components of tier capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be tier capital for insured depository institutions 
the legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives 
the dodd frank act also created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as atlantic coast bank  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators 
the new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations  and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
the legislation also broadened the base for federal deposit insurance corporation insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  lastly  the dodd frank act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments 
the legislation also directed the federal reserve board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
it is difficult to predict at this time what effect the new legislation and implementing regulations will have on community banks with regards to the lending and credit practices of such banks 
moreover  the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years 
although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time  it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations  particularly those relating to the new consumer financial protection bureau  will increase our operating and compliance costs 
changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income 
in response to the financial crisis of and early  congress has taken actions that are intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in financial institutions  and the federal deposit insurance corporation has taken actions to increase insurance coverage on deposit accounts 
the dodd frank act and implementing regulations are likely to have a significant effect on the financial services industry  which are likely to increase operating costs and reduce profitability 
in addition  there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount delinquent borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay on their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
the potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations  or changes in policy  affecting lending and funding practices and liquidity standards 
moreover  bank regulatory agencies have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements 
bank regulatory agencies  such as the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation  govern the activities in which we may engage  primarily for the protection of depositors  and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors 
in addition  new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business  and otherwise affect our operations 
new laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the markets for and value of our loans and investments  the fees we can charge  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
legislative proposals limiting our rights as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
risks relating to an investment in our common stock the company s stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume 
the company s common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market 
however  the average daily trading volume in the company s common stock is relatively small  approximately  shares per day in  and sometimes significantly less than that 
as a result  trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock  and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price 
if the company s market value of publicly held shares as defined under nasdaq rules falls below million or the price per share of the common stock falls below for a specified amount of time under nasdaq rules  the company has calendar days from the date of the receipt of the notification from nasdaq to regain compliance 
if the company is unable to regain compliance  the company may have to transfer its listing to the nasdaq capital market or begin trading on the over the counter bulletin board which is not a stock exchange 
the company s ability to pay dividends is limited 
atlantic coast financial corporation s ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory requirements and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital to meet the capital needs of the business  including capital needs related to future growth 
the primary source of income is the payment of dividends from atlantic coast bank to the company 
atlantic coast bank  in turn  is subject to regulatory requirements potentially limiting its ability to pay such dividends and by the need to maintain sufficient capital for its operations and obligations 
in addition  the company and bank are prohibited from paying dividends by the terms of the supervisory agreements entered into with our regulators 
thus  there can be no assurance the company will pay dividends to common stockholders  no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such dividends  and no assurance such dividends  if and when paid  will be maintained  at the same level or at all  in future periods 
on september   the company announced that it had suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend 
any future capital raises may dilute stockholders ownership  and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock 
the market price of the company s common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock at a price below the current market value 
because the company s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control  the company cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of any future offerings 
thus  the company s stockholders bear the risk of any future offerings reducing the market price of their common stock and diluting their stock holdings in the company s common stock

the company began paying quarterly dividends in may using earnings from investments and un invested proceeds received from the minority stock offering completed on october  on september   the company announced that it had suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend 
future dividend payments by atlantic coast financial corporation will be primarily dependent on dividends it receives from its subsidiary  atlantic coast bank 
under occ regulations  the dollar amount of dividends atlantic coast bank may pay is dependent upon its capital position and recent earnings 
under normal circumstances  if atlantic coast bank satisfies its capital requirements it may make dividend payments up to the limits prescribed in the occ regulations 
however  under the supervisory agreement entered into by the company on december   dividends or other capital distributions cannot be declared or paid prior to receiving a written non objection from the federal reserve 
the supervisory agreement also requires the bank obtain approval of the occ days prior to declaring a dividend payment or distribution of capital 
it is unlikely the company will be able to pay dividends to stockholders in the near future

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the bank s principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and the business community and making loans secured by various types of collateral  including real estate and other consumer assets 
the bank is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions  particularly interest rates  as well as government policies and regulations concerning among other things  monetary and fiscal affairs  housing and financial institutions 
attracting and maintaining deposits is influenced by a number of factors  including interest rates paid on competing investments offered by other financial and non financial institutions  account maturities  fee structures  and level of personal income and savings 
lending activities are affected by the demand for funds and thus are influenced by interest rates  the number and quality of lenders and regional economic growth 
sources of funds for lending activities of the bank include deposits  borrowings  payments on loans  maturities of securities and income provided from operations 
earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income and interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
interest income is a function of the balances of loans and investments outstanding during a given period and the yield earned on such loans and investments 
interest expense is a function of the amount of deposits and borrowings outstanding during the same period and interest rates paid on such deposits and borrowings 
provision for loan losses results from actual incurred losses when loans are charged off and the collateral is insufficient to recover unpaid amounts  as well as an allowance for estimated future losses from uncollected loans 
earnings are also affected by the bank s service charges  gains and losses from sales of loans and securities  commission income  interchange fees  other income  non interest expenses and income taxes 
non interest expenses consist of compensation and benefit expenses  occupancy and equipment costs  data processing costs  fdic insurance premiums  outside professional services  interchange fees  collection expenses and cost of repossessed assets  and other expenses 
earnings may also be negatively impacted by the supervisory agreements entered into by the company and the bank with the office of thrift supervision predecessor regulatory agency to the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal reserve 
please see supervision and regulation regulatory agreements with the office of thrift supervision and risk factors for more information 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances  including  but without limitation  changes in interest rates  performance of the economy  financial condition of borrowers and laws and regulations 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses  determining other than temporary impairment of securities  other real estate owned and accounting for deferred income taxes 
accounting policies are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses allowance is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is established as these losses are recognized through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
generally  loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibity of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
due to declining real estate values in our markets and the weak united states economy in general  it is increasingly likely that impairment reserves on non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans  will not be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss 
as a consequence the company recognizes the charge off of impairment reserves on non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans in the period the loan is classified as such 
this process accelerates the recognition of charge offs but has no impact on the impairment evaluation process 
the reasonableness of the allowance is reviewed and established by management  within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory guidelines  based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the bank s key lending areas 
senior credit officers monitor the conditions discussed above continuously and reviews are conducted quarterly with the bank s senior management and board of directors 
management s methodology for assessing the reasonableness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include a general loss component by type of loan and specific allowances for identified problem loans 
the allowance also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans 
the general loss component is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk evaluation of the loans or pools of loans 
changes to the risk evaluations relative to both performing and non performing loans affect the amount of this component 
loss factors are based on the bank s recent loss experience  current market conditions that may impact real estate values within the bank s primary lending areas  and on other significant factors that  in management s judgment  may affect the ability to collect loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
other significant factors that exist as of the balance sheet date that may be considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include credit quality trends including trends in non performing loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  geographic foreclosure rates  new and existing home inventories  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments and recent charge off experience in particular segments of the portfolio 
the impact of the general loss component on the allowance began increasing during and has continued to increase during each year through the increase reflected the deterioration of market conditions  and the increase in the recent loan loss experience that has resulted from management s proactive approach to charging off losses on impaired loans in the period the impairment is identified 
management also evaluates the allowance for loan losses based on a review of certain large balance individual loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows management expects to receive on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
for all specifically reviewed loans where it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement  impairment is determined by computing a fair value based on either discounted cash flows using the loan s initial interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
no specific allowance is recorded unless fair value is less than carrying value 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as individual consumer and residential loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and are excluded from the specific impairment evaluation  for these loans  the allowance for loan losses is calculated in accordance with the general allowance for loan losses policy described above 
accordingly  individual consumer and residential loans are not separately identified for impairment disclosures 
loans for which the terms have been modified as a result of the borrower s financial difficulties are considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
tdrs are measured for impairment based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s interest rate at inception of the loan or the appraised value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impairment of homogenous loans  such as one to four residential loans  that have been modified as tdrs is calculated in the aggregate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
loans modified as tdrs with market rates of interest are classified as impaired loans in the year of restructure and until the loan has performed for months in accordance with the modified terms 
the assessment of market rate of interest for homogenous tdr loans is done based on the weighted average rates of those loans compared to prevailing interest rates at the time of restructure 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   and million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   and as of december  the provision for loan losses for each quarter of and  and the total for the respective years is as follows in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total this data demonstrates the manner in which the allowance for loan losses and related provision expense can change over long term and short term periods 
changes in economic conditions  the nature and size of the loan portfolio and individual borrower conditions can dramatically impact the required level of allowance for loan losses  particularly for larger individually evaluated loan relationships  in relatively short periods of time 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to individually evaluated loan relationships was million at december  and million at december   an increase of million 
given the rapidly changing and uncertain real estate market coupled with changes in borrowers financial condition  weakening of collateral values  and the overall economic conditions  management anticipates there will continue to be significant changes in individual specific loss allocations in future periods as these factors are difficult to predict and can vary widely as more information becomes available or as projected events change 
fair value of securities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices  if available level 
for securities where quoted prices are not available  fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities level 
for securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available  fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators level 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment otti at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
in determining otti  management considers many factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions  and whether the company has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
the assessment of whether an other than temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
when otti is determined to have occurred  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss 
if the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the otti recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings 
the amount of the otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the company recorded an otti charge of  for the year ended december  other real estate owned assets acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value  less estimated selling costs  at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
if fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through expense 
costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized  whereas costs relating to the holding of property are expensed 
deferred income taxes after converting to a federally chartered savings bank  atlantic coast bank became a taxable organization 
income tax expense benefit is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary difference between carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates and operating loss carryforwards 
the company s principal deferred tax assets result from the allowance for loan losses and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the internal revenue code and applicable regulations are subject to interpretation with respect to the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities for credit unions that convert charters and become a taxable organization 
atlantic coast financial corporation records income tax expense based upon management s interpretation of the applicable tax regulations 
positions taken by the company in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities  and the review by taxing authorities of the positions taken by management could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered when determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax asset to a balance that is considered more likely than not to be realized 
the determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of such evidence 
positive evidence considered includes the probability of achieving forecasted taxable income and the ability to implement tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable income recognition 
negative evidence includes the company s cumulative losses 
following the initial establishment of a valuation allowance in  if the company is unable to generate sufficient pre tax income in future periods or otherwise fails to meet forecasted operating results  an additional valuation allowance may be required  offsetting the tax benefit for operating losses that would otherwise be recognized 
any valuation allowance is required to be recorded during the period identified 
as of december   the company had a valuation allowance of million  or of the net deferred tax asset 
business strategy overview 
our primary objective is to operate in our primary market areas as a retail community oriented financial institution  serving customers following a traditional retail banking model while providing stockholders a solid long term return on capital 
accomplishing this objective will require financial strength based on a strong capital position  and the implementation of business strategies designed to return the company to profitability consistent with safety and soundness considerations 
to strengthen the company s capital position the company is exploring all strategic alternatives to raise capital 
operating strategies are focused on credit management and reducing the cost of non performing assets  increasing revenues from mortgage warehouse lending and small business lending activities that maximize profits but with lower capital requirements  while reducing our expense base 
in addition  a key element of the company retail focus is to increase non maturity deposits which leads to deeper customer relationships and improve our cost of funds 
the following are the key elements of our business strategy strengthening our capital position 
based on the bank s non compliance with the imcr  current economic and market conditions  and the company s recent operating results  the company s board of directors began a review of strategic alternatives late in  engaging stifel  nicolaus weisel  incorporated to assist the board in exploring alternatives to enhance stockholder value  including consideration of a potential business combination in addition to a previously disclosed rights offering 
as part of its review of strategic alternatives  the company requested and has received approval from its primary regulator  the federal reserve  to pursue strategic alternatives that may lead to a transaction that requires stockholder approval 
there can be no assurances that the company will complete a business combination or raise additional capital 
the board of directors is reviewing all possible strategic alternatives and the relative benefits of such alternatives to stockholders 
continuing our proactive approach to reducing non performing assets by aggressive resolution and disposition initiatives 
as a result of the decline in our local economy beginning in  the bank experienced a substantial increase in our non performing assets 
at december   our non performing assets were million as compared to million at december  management has instituted a proactive strategy to aggressively reduce non performing assets through accelerated charge offs  loan work out programs  enhanced collection practices  the use of distressed asset sales and improved risk management 
an aggressive charge off policy 
beginning in  management began to implement an aggressive charge off strategy for one to four family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans by taking partial or full charge offs in the period that such loans became non accruing  generally when loans are days or more past due 
loan work out programs 
we remain committed to working with responsible borrowers to renegotiate residential loan terms 
the bank had million in troubled debt restructurings at december   compared to million at december  troubled debt restructurings avoid the expense of foreclosure proceedings and holding and disposition expenses of selling foreclosed property  and provide us increased interest income 
enhanced collection practices 
beginning in  due to the elevated delinquency of our one to four family residential mortgage loans and the increasing complexity of working out these types of loans  management engaged the services of a national third party servicer for certain loans 
initially  one to four family residential mortgage loans  and any associated home equity loan that was days past due  was assigned to the third party servicer for collection 
subsequently  the bank assigned other one to four family residential mortgage loans to the third party servicer irrespective of delinquency status  if it was determined the loan may have higher than normal collection risk 
at december   the outstanding balance of loans assigned to the third party servicer was million 
non performing asset sales 
in order to reduce the expenses of the foreclosure process  including the sale of foreclosed property  the bank has sold certain non performing loans through national loan sales of distressed assets  which may mitigate future losses 
from to december   the bank sold million of loans through distressed asset sales resulting in a loss on such sales of million 
the bank may continue distressed asset sales in the future to dispose of non performing assets when management believes it will result in the least overall loss to the company 
the bank also has accepted short sales of residential property by borrowers where such properties are sold at a loss and the proceeds of such sales are paid to us 
credit risk management 
the bank is also enhancing credit administration by improving internal risk management processes 
in  an independent risk committee of our board of directors was established to evaluate and monitor system  market and credit risk 
increasing revenue by expanding our warehouse lending operations and an increasing emphasis on commercial lending to small businesses 
historically  atlantic coast bank has emphasized the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans in northeastern florida and southeastern georgia 
at december   our one to four family residential loan portfolio was million  or  of our loan portfolio 
during late  the bank began to originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market on a limited scale 
as a result of our internal evaluation  management intends to shift our business model to sell mortgage loans originated by our internal sales force and sell mortgages purchased through warehouse lending arrangements 
in addition  the bank intends to increase production in its small business lending initiative 
warehouse lending strategy 
in the latter part of  the bank began a program for warehouse lending where we finance mortgages originated by third parties and hold a lien position for a short duration usually less than days while earning interest and often a fee until a sale is completed to an investor 
management expects to modestly expand this aspect of mortgage banking in the future 
commercial lending strategy 
management also plans to increase commercial business lending and owner occupied commercial real estate lending with an emphasis on small businesses  subject to regulatory capital requirements 
the bank intends to participate in government programs relating to commercial business loans such as the us small business administration sba and the us department of agriculture usda 
the bank began to implement this strategy in september  by hiring an executive to lead the small business lending along with an experienced sba lending team 
as of december  the sba loan pipeline grew from million at the beginning of the year to million at december  the company generally sells the guaranteed portion of sba loans to investors at attractive premiums 
our focus on owner occupied commercial real estate loans will be to professional service businesses 
the bank intends to target principal balances of up to million in our commercial business and owner occupied commercial real estate lending  while not originating or purchasing higher risk loans such as commercial real estate development projects  multi family loans and land acquisition and development loans 
expanding our retail franchise by growing our non maturity deposit 
we believe a strong core or non maturity deposit base is key to a retail community bank s success because customer relationships are deepened 
therefore we remain committed to generating lower cost and more stable non maturity deposits in our market 
the bank attracts and retains transaction accounts by offering competitive products and rates  excellent customer service and a comprehensive marketing program 
our deposit marketing programs are focused on individuals  businesses and municipalities located in our market area 
our non maturity deposits consisting of demand  savings and money market accounts increased million to million at december  from million at december  at december   non maturity deposits comprised of our total deposits  compared to of our total deposits at december  non maturity deposits are our least costly source of funds  which improves our interest rate spread and also contributes non interest income from account related services 
reducing our operating expense base 
the company has historically operated with a high cost structure as it has implemented growth and new business activities 
in order to improve profitability we are focused on reducing operating costs which do not add value to our other business strategies by implementing a review of all major vendors and operating processes 
these actions are expected to reduce the run rate of operating expenses  before credit costs  by approximately million in comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general 
in order to maintain its well capitalized status  the company strategically reduced its assets during total assets decreased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  specifically net portfolio loans decreased by million  investments in available for sale securities decreased by million  bank owned life insurance decreased by million and other real estate owned decreased by million 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million and loans held for sale of million 
non maturity deposits consisting of demand  savings and money market accounts grew by a combined million  while time deposits decreased by million and federal home loan bank advances decreased by million 
following is a summarized comparative balance sheet as of december  and december  december  december  increase decrease dollars percentage dollars in thousands assets cash and cash equivalents    securities available for sale    loans    allowance for loan losses    loans  net    loans held for sale    other assets    total assets    liabilities and stockholders equity deposits non interest bearing demand    interest bearing demand    savings and money market    time    total deposits    federal home loan bank advances    securities sold under agreements to repurchase   other borrowings   accrued expenses and other liabilities   total liabilities    stockholders equity    total liabilities and stockholders equity   cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents were comprised of cash on hand and interest earning and non interest earning balances held in other depository institutions 
at december   cash and cash equivalents were greater as compared to december  due to the decline in loans  net and securities available for sale  which increased our liquidity 
however  during much of  cash and cash equivalents were lower as compared to previous years due to the decline in total deposits  primarily time deposits 
as opportunities became available excess cash was invested in short term cash management accounts at other banks until more permanent and higher yielding assets are identified 
management expects the balances in cash and cash equivalents will continue to fluctuate as other interest earning assets mature  but generally be held at balances necessary to meet liquidity requirements while excess amounts are deployed to higher yielding assets 
the company believes it has sufficient contingent liquidity sources to meet liquidity demands 
securities available for sale 
securities available for sale was comprised primarily of debt securities of us government sponsored enterprises  and mortgage backed securities 
the investment portfolio decreased approximately million to million at december   net of purchases  sales and maturities  as these proceeds were primarily re invested in loans held for sale 
included in this decrease was the disposal of private label collateralized mortgage obligations which totaled million at the end of in order to eliminate the risk of additional other than temporary impairment charges  the company sold the four remaining private label securities totaling million at a loss of  during and accordingly had no private label securities at december  expense for other than temporary impairment otti of  was recorded in non interest income for the year ended december  at december   approximately million  or of the debt securities held by the company were issued by us government sponsored entities and agencies  primarily fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support 
the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  as the unrealized losses were attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity  and not credit quality  and the company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery 
approximately million of the company s available for sale securities were collateral for structured transactions totaling million that were entered into during and under agreements to repurchase see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
these transactions were entered into by the company to take advantage of favorable interest rate spreads and to reduce overall exposure to interest rate risk in and as a result of the unprecedented decline in interest rates beginning in  as well as illiquidity in the mortgage backed securities market  coupled with the overall decline in the bank s credit quality  the bank has been subject to additional collateral requirements by the third party counterparties to the repurchase agreements 
additionally  given the collateral requirements of these transactions  the current interest rate environment and the illiquidity in the marketplace  the available for sale securities portfolio is currently a limited source of liquidity 
loans held for sale 
loans held for sale were comprised entirely of loans secured by one to four family residential homes originated internally or purchased from third party originators as part of our warehouse lending program 
as of december   the weighted average number of days outstanding of real estate mortgages held for sale was days 
during the year ended december  the company originated a total of million of loans held for sale  comprised of approximately million of loans originated internally  and approximately million of loans purchased from third parties under warehouse loan agreements 
approximately million of the loans were sold  resulting in a gain of million and interest earned of approximately million or on outstanding balances was recorded in interest income 
for the year ended december  gains on sales and interest earned was million and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to focus on opportunities to grow this line of business in the near future due to its favorable margins and efficient capital management

sba loans as of december  which are included in commercial real estate  commercial construction and commercial loans  were million as compared to  at december  the balance of sba loans at year end includes approximately million of non guaranteed originated loan balances 
total portfolio loan originations decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to lessened loan demand 
until critical economic factors such as unemployment and residential real estate values stabilize and the bank increases its capital levels  management believes portfolio loan balances will continue to decline 
principal amortization and loan payoffs are expected to exceed growth in the sba portfolio and other small business lending production 
for a discussion regarding the effects of the decline in property values on the bank s one to four family residential loan portfolio  see item business lending activities one to four family real estate portfolio lending 
however  due to a favorable interest rate environment  production of one to four family loans held for sale in the secondary market is expected to continue its moderate pace 
the strategy of selling the majority of originated loans in the secondary market also compliments the bank s desire to reduce portfolio loan balances in order to maximize capital efficiently 
the composition of the bank s loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward one to four family residential loans 
as of december   first mortgages including residential construction loans  second mortgages and home equity loans totaled million  or of total gross loans

due to the decline in real estate values over the past two years  management believes it is appropriate and prudent to reduce the carrying balance of loans collateralized by non performing one to four family residential property by the expected loss amount which is both probable and reasonable to estimate  rather than providing a general allowance 
the million decline in net charge offs for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily due to a million loss on a distressed asset sale of million of non performing residential loans and a million charge off on one commercial construction real estate loan  both of which occurred in the decrease in the provision for loan losses of million in as compared to was primarily due to lower charge offs on one to four family and commercial construction loans  partially offset by higher charge offs on home equity loans

the increase in non performing commercial real estate loans was primarily due to two income producing properties which had been restructured and previously classified as performing  but began to demonstrate some weakness  prompting management to classify them as non performing 
the million increase in non performing commercial business and other real estate loans was comprised of one undeveloped land loan and one multi family condominium loan 
the million increase in non performing home equity loans was primarily due to two first lien position home equity loans which are in the process of foreclosure 
the million increase in non performing other commercial loans was comprised primarily of three loans two commercial lines of credit of  each and one commercial business loan of approximately  as of december   total non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans of million included million of one to four family residential loans that had been written down to the estimated fair value of their collateral 
further declines in the fair value of the collateral  or a decision to sell loans as distressed assets  could result in additional losses 
as of december   and december   all non performing loans were classified as non performing  and there were no loans days past due and accruing interest as of december  and other real estate owned declined million primarily due to greater sales of foreclosed assets

the allowance for loan losses allocated to consumer loans decreased million primarily due to the decrease in allowance required for mobile home loans 
in the bank assumed full liability for mobile home loans purchased from a broker based on a settlement of deposits maintained at the bank for loan losses 
initially the allowance estimated for these loans was of outstanding balances 
based on historical losses and other factors this reserve is now maintained at of outstanding balance

impaired loans also include troubled debt restructurings tdrs where the borrower has performed for less than months under the terms of the modification and or the tdr loan is at less than market rate at the time of restructure 
the assessment of market rate of interest for homogenous tdr loans is done based on the weighted average rates of those loans compared to prevailing interest rates at the time of restructure 
when a tdr loan with a market rate of interest has performed for over months under terms of the modification it is classified as a performing loan 
non performing impaired loans increased million primarily due to six commercial loans  five of which had been restructured during  which moved to non performing status during performing tdrs decreased primarily due to the reclassification of one commercial real estate loan of million to non performing when the borrower failed to perform  and the reclassification of residential loans to performing status following months of performance under terms of the modification 
non performing loans as of december  and of million and  respectively  were previously modified as tdrs but failed to perform under the terms of the modification 
tdrs decreased million at year end  as compared to the year end at december   approximately million or of the tdrs were one to four family loans of which approximately million were not performing according to the restructured terms 
impairment due to modification in troubled debt restructurings of non performing loans  such as one to four family residential loans is included in general reserve 
as of december  and this reserve was  and  respectively 
deferred income taxes 
as of both december  and  the bank concluded that  while improved operating results are expected as the economy begins to improve which would reduce our non performing assets  the variability of the credit related costs are such that a more likely than not conclusion of realization of our deferred tax asset could not be supported 
consequently  management recorded a valuation allowance of million for the full amount of the net federal and state deferred tax assets as of december  until such time as the determination is made it is more likely than not that the company is able to generate taxable income  no tax benefits will be recorded in future periods to reduce net losses before taxes 
however  at such time in the future that we record taxable income or determine that realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  some or all of the valuation allowance may be available as a tax benefit 
deposits 
total deposit account balances were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  time deposits decreased million but non maturity deposits increased million as consumers demonstrated a preference for shorter duration  more liquid deposit products rather than re investing in time deposits due to the low interest rate environment 
the increase in non maturity deposits occurred as depositors increased their savings and money market accounts by million and also increased their interest bearing demand accounts by million between december  and management believes near term deposit growth will be moderate with an emphasis on non maturity deposits to match asset growth expectations 
dramatic changes in the short term interest rate environment could affect the availability of deposits in our local market however and therefore cause the bank to promote time deposit growth in order to meet liquidity needs 
under atlantic coast bank s supervisory agreement with the office of thrift supervision dated december   the bank may not increase brokered deposits without prior written approval 
according to the terms of the agreement the bank could not have more than million of brokered deposits outstanding 
at december  the bank had brokered deposits of million 
the company s management does not believe the restriction has a significant effect on the company s liquidity

securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the bank has million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase reverse repo comprised of structured notes with two different counterparties in amounts totaling million and million  respectively 
the individual agreements take the form of term repurchase agreements with maturities beginning in and final maturities in the fair value of the securities collateralizing the reverse repos at december  was million 
the market value of the debt and certain other collateral requirements exceeded the principal balance outstanding by million 
the agreements with the counterparty of the million reverse repo contain default conditions which if triggered would materially impact the bank s capital and results of operations 
in the event the bank becomes less than adequately capitalized or receives a cease and desist order from the occ the counterparty has the option to terminate the reverse repo agreements at the market rate of the debt 
as of december  the market rate of the debt exceeded the principal balance outstanding by million 
information concerning securities sold under agreements to repurchase as of december  is summarized as follows dollars in thousands average daily balance during the period  average interest rate during the period maximum month end balance  weighted average interest rate at period end weighted average maturity months federal home loan bank advances 
fhlb advances of million had a weighted average maturity of months and a weighted average rate of at december  the million decrease in fhlb borrowings at december  as compared to december  was due to repayments of million offset by additional borrowings of million 
the company expects to continue to utilize fhlb advances to manage both short and long term liquidity needs to the extent it has borrowing capacity  needs funding and the interest expense of fhlb advances is attractive compared to deposits and other alternative sources of funds 
other borrowings 
other borrowings were and million at december  and  respectively 
the company borrowed million  at a market rate  from another financial institution in june secured by shares of atlantic coast federal corporation s common stock owned by atlantic coast federal  mhc 
the company s chairman of the board also serves as the president and chief executive officer and a director of the financial institution from which the borrowing was obtained 
the company repaid the million loan with proceeds from the second step conversion and offering in february stockholders equity stockholders equity increased by approximately million to million at december  from million at december  due to the completion of the second step conversion and offering  which was nearly offset by the net loss of million for the year ended december  and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
on february   the second step conversion of atlantic coast federal  mhc into the stock holding company structure and related stock offering of atlantic coast financial corporation was completed 
net proceeds of million were raised in the stock offering  which included  loaned by the company to a trust for the esop enabling it to purchase  shares of common stock in the stock offering for allocation under such plan 
million of the proceeds was also used to repay the other borrowings described above 
during and  the company implemented strategies to preserve capital including the suspension of cash dividends and its stock repurchase program 
resumption of these programs is not expected to occur in the near term 
the company s equity to assets ratio increased to at december   from at december  atlantic coast bank continued to be in excess of all minimum regulatory capital requirements  and is considered well capitalized under those formulas 
however  as of december   the bank was not in compliance with the individual minimum capital requirement imcr agreed to by the bank with the office of thrift supervision on may  under the imcr  the bank agreed to achieve a tier leverage ratio of as of september   and maintain such ratio for future quarters 
total risk based capital to risk weighted assets was  tier capital to risk weighted assets was  and tier capital to adjusted total assets tier leverage ratio was at december   respectively

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
the company s net loss for the year ended december   was million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decreased net loss of million was primarily due to the million decrease in our provision for loan losses as a result of lower net charge offs 
the provision for loan losses was million in  a decrease of from million in net interest income decreased  or million for the year ended december  to million  as compared to  due to the decrease in average balances of interest earning assets as a result of the company s capital preservation plan  as well as a decrease in average yield of interest earning assets 
non interest income for the year ended december  increased by to million  as compared to million in  due primarily to higher gains on sales of available for sale securities and loans as well as lower other than temporary impairment charges on available for sale securities 
non interest expense increased to million in from million for the year ended december  primarily due to increased expenses associated with our mortgage banking and small business lending platforms

interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as shown in the table above the decrease in interest income for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to both a decrease in average balances of interest earning assets of million as well as a decrease in average yield of basis points 
the decline in interest income earned on loans was due to payoffs on higher rate one to four family residential loans as borrowers refinanced at historically low rates 
proceeds from payoffs on one to four family loans were primarily re invested in loans held for sale  which yielded approximately during the year ended december  the decrease in average outstanding balances of one to four family real estate loans for the year ended december   as compared to  accounted for substantially all of the total million decrease in average loan balances 
interest income in from securities decreased by approximately million due to a million decline in average balances  as well as a basis point decrease in average yields on purchases of new securities 
our interest income could continue to decrease in the near term due to continued low interest rates and limited loan growth 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to the lower average balances of interest bearing liabilities which decreased by million as well as lower interest rates paid on average outstanding balances of deposit accounts 
during the year ended december   the federal reserve board maintained the target rate for federal funds borrowings at

however  future reduction in deposit costs are likely to be less and therefore  considering the fixed rate cost of the borrowings  net interest income is expected to continue to decrease in provision for loan losses 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses based on all known and inherent losses that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and changes in borrower situations 
in addition  the office of the comptroller of the currency  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
provisions for loan losses of million and million were made during the years ended december  and  respectively

the decline of interest income earned on loans was due to payoffs on higher rate one to four family loans as borrowers refinanced at historically low rates 
the decrease in average outstanding balances of one to four family real estate loans for the year ended december   as compared to  accounted for the majority of the total million decrease in average loan balances 
interest income earned in from securities decreased by approximately  due to an basis point decrease in average rates on new purchases of comparable securities  which was partially offset by higher average outstanding balances as a result of reinvesting liquidity from loan pay offs securities

see also the item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of financial condition at december  and securities available for sale 
these charges represent credit losses from our investments in non agency collateralized mortgage obligations  caused by defaults and losses on the underlying mortgages 
as of december  the bank held approximately million of non agency collateralized mortgages 
due to the weak ongoing economic conditions there is no assurance that additional losses may not be incurred in the future 
the million decrease in other non interest income was the result of two non recurring items in  a gain of approximately  on the sale of the lake city branch on december  and approximately million resulting from a settlement agreement with an on going third party originator whereby the company assumed responsibility for credit losses on a pool of loans 
the decrease in loss on sale of loans for the year ended december  as compared to  results from bulk sales of non performing one to four family residential loans through a third party national sales advisor 
this approach is occasionally used when management believes it will reduce ongoing collection costs and  ultimately  result in the least cost to the bank 
the bank incurred losses of million on such sales in services charges and fees  which are earned primarily based on transaction services for deposit account customers  decreased as a result of decreased activity resulting in lower atm and check card overdraft fees

income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased to for the year ended december   from a tax expense of million for the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately million during resulted in a much higher tax expense than what may be expected based upon our pre tax loss 
the valuation allowance also caused significant distortion in the effective income tax rate on income before income taxes for the year ended december   which was  compared to for liquidity management maintains a liquidity position it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
atlantic coast financial corporation relies on a number of different sources in order to meet its potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources of funds are increases in borrowings  deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and securities sales 
the scheduled amortization of loans and securities as well as proceeds from borrowings  are predictable sources of funds 
in addition held for sale loans  principally warehouse loans  repay rapidly with an average duration of less than days  with repayments generally funding advances 
other funding sources  however  such as inflows from new deposits  mortgage prepayments and mortgage loan sales are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several contingent liquidity sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   and december  the company had additional borrowing capacity of million and million  respectively  with the fhlb of atlanta 
subsequent to year end  the company s borrowing capacity was reduced by approximately million following a fhlb of atlanta credit and collateral review 
the company also maintains a secured line of credit with the federal reserve bank and at december  and the borrowing capacity was million and million  respectively 
unpledged marketable investment securities were approximately million as of december  the company also utilizes a non brokered direct deposit certificate of deposit listing to meet funding needs at interest rates equal to or less than local market rates 
threats to the bank s liquidity position include rapid declines in deposit balances due to market volatility caused by major changes in interest rates or negative public perception about the bank  or the financial services industry in general 
in addition  the bank s agreements for sales of securities under agreements to repurchase reverse repo which total million have collateral requirements in excess of the debt  this limiting the amount of investment securities available to meet liquidity needs 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million as of december   to million as of december  cash from investing activities of million was more than cash used for operating activities of million and cash used for financing activities of million 
primary sources of cash were from proceeds from sales of securities available for sale of million  proceeds from maturities and payments of available for sale securities of million  proceeds from the sale of stock in the second step conversion and offering of million  proceeds from the surrender of boli of million and proceeds from the sale of other real estate owned of million

inflation the effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions 
while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets and our profitability  management believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having corresponding effect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by us 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the opposite may occur 
off balance sheet arrangements as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and fhlb advances  re price more rapidly or at different rates than our interest earning assets 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material prolonged increases or decreases in interest rates on our results of operations  management has adopted an asset and liability management policy 
the board of directors sets the asset and liability management policy for us  which is implemented by the asset liability committee 
the purpose of the asset liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the asset liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk  and profitability goals 
the asset liability committee generally meets at least monthly to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to market value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations 
the asset liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at least quarterly 
a key element of our asset liability plan is to protect net earnings by managing the maturity or re pricing mismatch between our interest earning assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
historically  management has sought to reduce exposure to earnings through the use of adjustable rate loans and through the sale of certain fixed rate loans in the secondary market  and by extending funding maturities through the use of fhlb advances 
net portfolio value 
given the current relatively low level of market interest rates  an npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the bank earns on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  management estimates what net interest income would be for a rolling forward twelve month period using historical data for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  the current term structure for interest rates  and current deposit and loan offering rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous  and basis point increase or a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
at december  net interest income estimated decrease in npv npv as a percentage of present value of assets increase decrease in estimated net interest income change in interest rates basis points estimated npv amount percent npv ratio increase decrease basis points estimated net interest income amount percent in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
pv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income 
modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value and net interest income information presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or re pricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
