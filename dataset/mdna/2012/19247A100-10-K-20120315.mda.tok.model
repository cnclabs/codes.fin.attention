it is our policy to continuously monitor and evaluate the adequacy of our capital 
we have consistently maintained net capital in excess of the regulatory requirements for our broker dealer  as prescribed by the securities and exchange commission sec

the ultimate co investment amount and actual timing of the funding of this commitment is currently unknown  as the co investment amount will be based on investor commitments to grp through october  and the drawdown of our commitment is contingent on the timing of drawdowns by the underlying funds and co investments in which grp invests

off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity  capital resources  market or credit risk support  or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we believe the estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a thorough understanding of our accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
management considers the following accounting policies critical to an informed review of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of these and additional accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investments we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such determination at each statement of financial condition date 
securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as trading securities and are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices  market prices obtained from independent pricing services engaged by management or as determined by our fair value committee 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as gain loss from trading securities reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments classified as equity investments are accounted for using the equity method  under which we recognize our respective share of the investee s net income or loss for the period 
the carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair value 
investments classified as available for sale are comprised of equity securities  investment grade preferred instruments and investments in our sponsored open end and closed end mutual funds 
these investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or market prices obtained from independent pricing services engaged by management  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we periodically review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss  or impairment  to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 
if we believe an impairment of a security position is other than temporary  the loss will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
an other than temporary impairment is generally presumed to have occurred if the available for sale investment has an unrealized loss continuously for or more months 
from time to time  our consolidated funds enter into derivative contracts to hedge market and credit risks of the underlying portfolios utilizing options  total return swaps and credit default swaps 
we recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
the fair value of these instruments are recorded in other assets or other liabilities and accrued expenses in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
these investments are measured at fair value with gains and losses recorded as gain loss from trading securities net in our consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of an acquired company over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value to their carrying amounts 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
we determined that the fair values of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their carrying values as a result of the most recent impairment test performed as of november  stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments granted to employees 
this expense is recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service 
we also estimate forfeitures 
income taxes we record the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable income in future years 
we record a valuation allowance  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
this new guidance is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the new guidance requires changes to the components of net income and comprehensive income in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and the total of comprehensive income 
the new guidance should be applied retrospectively 
in december  the fasb issued guidance to defer the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this new guidance is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosures 
the new guidance results in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting requirements 
this new guidance changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this new guidance is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to the risk from changes in interest and currency rates and securities market and general economic fluctuations  which may have an adverse impact on the value of our investments 
at december   we had approximately million securities owned and approximately million securities sold but not yet purchased as a result of consolidating our onshore global real estate long short fund and cohen steers global listed infrastructure fund 
at december   we had approximately million of equity investments  which represented our equity interests in the offshore global real estate long short fund 
as of december   we had approximately million of investments  available for sale which were comprised of approximately million invested in our sponsored mutual funds  million invested in perpetual preferred securities and million invested in foreign and domestic common stocks 
the following is a summary of the effect that a percent increase or decrease in equity prices would have on our investments subject to equity price fluctuation at december  carrying value carrying value assuming a increase carrying value assuming a decrease securities owned equity investments investments  available for sale a significant majority of our revenue approximately  and in the years ended december   and  respectively was derived from investment advisory agreements with our clients 
under these agreements  the investment advisory and administration fee we receive is based on the market value of the assets we manage 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally  and real estate securities in particular  attributable to such market factors as inflation  interest changes and economic downturn  may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease  which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees  or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk  which would also result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 
in addition  market conditions may preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in closed end mutual funds 
the market conditions for these offerings may not be as favorable in the future  which could adversely impact our ability to grow the assets we manage and realize higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
further  depending on market conditions  the closed end funds we manage may increase or decrease their leverage in order to maintain the funds target leverage ratios  thereby increasing or decreasing the assets we manage 
as of december   and of the assets we managed were concentrated in us real estate common stocks and international real estate common stocks  respectively 
an increase in interest rates or prolonged economic downturn could have a negative impact on the valuation of reits and other securities in our clients portfolios  which could reduce our revenue 
in addition  an increase in interest rates or prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact our ability to increase open end mutual fund assets and to offer new mutual funds
