when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset  long lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset  long lived asset or goodwill  including its eventual residual value  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million  million and million  respectively  as of december  the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january of each year 
for goodwill impairment review purposes  the company has two reporting units  the waters division and ta division

income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 
in addition  the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard  which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances  but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money 
at december   the company had unrecognized tax benefits of million 
litigation as described in item  legal proceedings  of part i of this form k  the company is a party to various pending litigation matters 
with respect to each pending claim  management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and  if so  the probable range of that loss 
if and when management has determined  with respect to a particular claim  both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss  the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss 
the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 
with respect to the claims referenced in item  legal proceedings  of part i of this form k  management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to certain claims 
as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available  management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range  which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company s results of operations or financial position 
pension and other retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are evaluated and updated annually 
the company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be for its us benefit plans and for its us benefit plans 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december  that best matched the timing of the plan s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
once the interest rates were determined  the plan s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
at december   the company determined the weighted average discount rate to be for the us benefit plans and for the non us benefits plans 
a one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than million 
a one quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long term rate of return would decrease the company s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than million 
stock based compensation the accounting standard for stock based compensation requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
the company has used the black scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
this accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard  the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stock based compensation accounting standard and  consequently  has not adjusted results from prior years 
under the modified transition method  compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december  and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december  the company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method 
as of december   unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions unrecognized compensation costs weighted average life in years stock options restricted stock units restricted stock total recent accounting standard changes and developments information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from part ii
