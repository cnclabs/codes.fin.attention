item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business included in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  prepared avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states 
our history and expertise in handling california grown avocados has allowed us to develop a reputation of delivering quality products  at competitive prices  while providing competitive returns to our growers 
this reputation has enabled us to expand our product offerings to include avocados sourced on an international basis  prepared avocado products  and other perishable foods 
we report our operations in two different business segments fresh products and calavo foods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our fresh products business grades  sizes  packs  cools  and ripens if desired avocados for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate two packinghouses and three operating and distributing facilities that handle avocados across the united states 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs is fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts to retain and recruit growers that meet our business model 
additionally  our fresh products business also procures avocados grown in chile  mexico and peru  as well as other various commodities  including tomatoes  papayas  and pineapples 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that  together with certain co packers that we frequently purchase fruit from  handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market and approximately of the avocados exported from mexico to countries other than the united states during the mexican season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to increase our market share of currently sourced avocados to all accepted marketplaces 
we believe our diversified avocado sources provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing our other various commodities  such as those shown above  complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 
our calavo foods business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
all of our prepared avocado products are now cold pasteurized and include both frozen and fresh guacamole 
due to the long shelf life of our frozen guacamole and the purity of our fresh guacamole  we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today s customers 
additionally  we also prepare various fresh salsa products and ready to eat produce and deli products 
see note and note for additional information related to the acquisitions of csl and rfg 
customers include both food service industry and retail businesses 
we continue to seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
net sales of frozen products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and the operating results of all of our businesses have been  and will continue to be  affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and calavo foods we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future 
recent developments dividend payment on december   we paid a per share dividend in the aggregate amount of  to shareholders of record on december  contingencies hacienda suits we are currently under examination by the mexican tax authorities hacienda for the tax years ended december   and during the third quarter of fiscal year  we received an update from our outside legal counsel regarding the examination of the tax year ended december  the appellate court upheld a lower court s decision on the two remaining items that we previously received an unfavorable ruling on 
based on discussions with our legal counsel  however  we believe that there were certain administrative errors made by the appellate court and that one of the outstanding tax issues will be resolved in favor of the company  while the other remaining issue remains unsettled 
the total assessment related to this examination is estimated to be approximately million 
based on discussion with our legal counsel  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be successful in our defense and our tax position will be upheld based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
as such  no accrual has been recorded as of october  in the first quarter of fiscal  we received an assessment totaling approximately  related to the tax year ended december  this assessment relates to depreciation expense taken on our tax return 
based on discussions with legal counsel  we believe that the hacienda s position is without merit and do not believe that the resolution of this examination will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the hacienda has concluded their examination for the year ended december   noting no changes 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the examination of the tax year ended december  was settled by the court in our favor

johnson and rfg nominee trust collectively  the sellers entered into an agreement and plan of merger dated may  the acquisition agreement  which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which calavo would acquire a percent ownership interest in rfg 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  newco  a newly formed delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of calavo  merged with and into rfg  with rfg as the surviving entity 
rfg is a fresh food company that produces  markets  and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy  high quality products for consumers via the retail channel

in addition  if rfg attains specified financial goals for certain month periods prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing  we have agreed to pay rfg up to an additional approximate million in earn out consideration  based on the fair value of calavo s common stock on june   payable in cash and shares of unregistered calavo common stock  as described below in greater detail 
as a result  if the maximum earn out consideration is earned  the total consideration payable to rfg pursuant to the acquisition agreement could be approximately million 
the fair value of consideration is currently being determined by the company and will be less than the maximum consideration noted above 
the acquisition agreement contains covenants  representations and warranties of calavo and rfg that are customary for transactions of this type 
prior to entering into the acquisition agreement  and other than with respect to the acquisition agreement  neither we  nor any of our officers  directors  or affiliates had any material relationship with rfg or the sellers

in the event that the maximum ebitda and revenue achievements have not been reached within five years after the closing date  but rfg s month ebitda during such period equals or exceeds million and rfg has concurrently reached a corresponding revenue achievement  a sliding scale  as defined  will be used to calculate payment 
the minimum amount to be paid in the sliding scale related to the st earn out payment is approximately million  payable in both cash and shares of unregistered calavo common stock 
rfg has five years to achieve any consideration pursuant to the st earn out payment 
assuming that the maximum earn out payment has been achieved in the st earn out payment  if rfg s ebitda  for a month period commencing after the closing date and ending prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing date  is equal to or greater than million for each of the month periods therein  and rfg has concurrently reached a corresponding revenue achievement  we have agreed to pay the sellers million in cash and to issue to the sellers  shares of unregistered calavo common stock  representing total consideration of approximately million 
this represents the maximum that can be awarded pursuant to the nd earn out payment 
in the event that the maximum ebitda and revenue achievements have not been reached within five years after the closing date  but rfg s month ebitda during such period equals or exceeds million  and rfg has concurrently reached a corresponding revenue achievement  a sliding scale will be used to calculate payment 
the minimum amount to be paid in the sliding scale related to the nd earn out payment is approximately million  payable in both cash and shares of unregistered calavo common stock 
rfg has five years to achieve any consideration pursuant to the nd earn out payment 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and equity issued at the date of acquisition in thousands 
we obtained third party valuations for the long term assets acquired and incurred approximately million in acquisition costs  which have been expensed in selling  general and administrative expenses in the period incurred 
for the two months ended july   since the acquisition of rfg  total selling  general and administrative expenses for rfg was million

as discussed above  we will be required to pay a maximum of approximately million if rfg achieves specified revenue targets 
the fair value of this contingent consideration was determined based on a probability weighted method  which incorporates management s forecasted revenue  and the likelihood of the revenue targets being achieved

critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales 
the derived percentage is then applied to the current period s sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period 
the offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities 
when certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional  they are written off against this allowance 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
a change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately million 
income taxes 
we account for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  we perform an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from management s estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
goodwill  defined as unidentified asset s acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition  is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and determined that no impairment existed as of october  allowance for accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income interest income interest expense other income  net net income net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
firstly  americans are eating more avocados 
over the last years  united states us consumption of avocados has expanded at a compounded annual growth rate of and we do not anticipate this growth significantly changing 
we believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the united states contributes to such growth  as avocados  which are cholesterol and sodium free  are dense in fiber  vitamin b  antioxidants  potassium  folate  and contain unsaturated fat  which help lower cholesterol 
also  a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients  which avocados are rich in  help fight chronic illnesses  such as heart disease and cancer 
additionally  we believe that the demographic changes in the us will greatly impact the consumption of avocados and avocado based products 
the hispanic community currently accounts for approximately of the us population  and the total number of hispanics is estimated to triple by the year avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers  as the per capita avocado consumption in mexico is estimated to be more than seven fold that of the us we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by year round availability of fresh avocados due to imports  a rapid growing hispanic population  and the promotion of the health benefits of avocados 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
additionally  we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in  as interest in avocados continues to expand 
in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
this board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses 
during fiscal  and  on behalf of avocado growers  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the california avocado commission 
during fiscal  and  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the hass avocado board related to avocados 
additionally  through the acquisition of rfg  we substantially expanded and accelerated the company s presence in the fast growing refrigerated fresh packaged foods category through an array of retail product lines for produce  deli  meat and food service departments 
we also believe that our diversified fresh products  specifically tomatoes and papayas  are positioned for future growth and expansion 
the tomato is the fourth most popular fresh market vegetable behind potatoes  lettuce  and onions in the united states 
although stabilizing in the first decade of the s  annual average fresh market tomato consumption remains well above that of the previous decade 
over the past few decades  per capita use of tomatoes has been on the rise due to the enduring popularity of salads  salad bars  and bacon lettuce tomato and submarine sandwiches 
perhaps of greater importance has been the introduction of improved tomato varieties  heightened consumer interest in a wider range of tomatoes  a surge of new immigrants who eat vegetable intensive diets  and expanding national emphasis on health and nutrition 
papayas have become more popular as the consumption in the united states has more than doubled in the past decade 
papayas have high nutritional benefits 
they are rich in anti oxidants  the b vitamins  folate and pantothenic acid  and the minerals  potassium and magnesium  and fiber 
together  these nutrients promote the health of the cardiovascular system and also provide protection against colon cancer 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
we provide for sales returns and promotional allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience

see note in the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition of rfg 
net sales for the year ended october   when compared to  increased by million  or  principally as a result of an increase in both our fresh products and calavo foods segments 
while the procurement of fresh avocados related to our fresh products segment is very seasonal  our calavo foods business is generally not subject to a seasonal effect 
the significant increase in sales of our calavo foods business for the year ended october   when compared to  is primarily related to the sales of our newly acquired business  rfg  on june  this increase was partially offset  however  by a decrease in sales related to our guacamole products 
this was primarily due to a decrease in total pounds of product sold 
net sales to third parties by segment exclude value added services billed by our uruapan packinghouse and our uruapan processing plant to the parent company 
all intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations 
fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase in fresh product sales during fiscal was primarily related to an increase in sales of mexican sourced avocados 
this increase was partially offset  however  by decreased sales from tomatoes and california sourced avocados 
see details below 
sales of mexican sourced avocados increased million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in mexican sourced avocados was due to a combination of an increase in pounds sold and an increase in the sales price per carton 
mexican sourced avocados sales reflect an increase in million pounds of avocados sold  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute most of this increase in volume to the significant decrease in the california avocado crop see below 
in addition  the sales price per carton increased by approximately 
we attribute this increase primarily to a lower overall volume of avocados in the marketplace  as well as a steady to higher demand for avocados when compared to the same prior year period 
mexican grown avocados are primarily sold in the us  japanese  and or european marketplace 
we anticipate that sales of mexican grown avocados will decrease in fiscal  due to a higher volume of avocados in the marketplace which will decrease overall sales prices 
partially offsetting the overall increase was a decrease in sales of tomatoes of million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for tomatoes was primarily due to a decrease in volume by when compared to the same prior year period 
this significant decrease was mainly due to a freeze in mexico that resulted in less units in the marketplace 
in addition  tomatoes had a decrease in the average selling price per carton of approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
sales of california sourced avocados decreased million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in california sourced avocados was due to a decrease of million pounds of avocados sold or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute most of this decrease in volume to the smaller california avocado crop in the current year 
partially offsetting this decrease  california sourced avocado sales reflect an increase in the sales price per carton of approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute this increase primarily to a lower overall volume of avocados in the marketplace  as well as a higher demand for avocados  when compared to the same prior year period 
california avocados are primarily sold in the us marketplace 
we anticipate that sales volume of california grown avocados will increase in fiscal  due to a larger expected avocado crop 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase was primarily related to an increase in sales of california sourced avocados due primarily to a significant increase in cartons sold as well as tomatoes due primarily to an increase in units sold and an increase in per unit sales price 
these increases were partially offset  however  by decreased sales from mexican sourced avocados due primarily to a decrease in cartons sold and a decrease in sales price per unit  pineapples due primarily to a decrease in units sold  as well as chilean sourced avocados due primarily to a decrease in cartons sold and a decrease in sales price per unit 
sales of california sourced avocados increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
california sourced avocado sales reflect a increase in pounds of avocados sold  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in california sourced avocados was primarily related to the larger california avocado crop for fiscal our market share of california avocados decreased to for fiscal year  when compared to a market share for the same prior year period 
the average selling price  on a per carton basis  of california avocados sold decreased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute this decrease to the higher overall volume of california avocados in the marketplace 
california avocados are primarily sold in the us marketplace 
we anticipate that sales of california grown avocados will significantly decrease in fiscal  due to a significantly smaller expected avocado crop 
sales of tomatoes increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in sales for tomatoes is due to an increase in the average per carton selling price of  in addition to a increase in the number of units sold 
we attribute most of the increase in the per carton selling price to the lower volume of tomatoes in the us marketplace due to weather conditions in florida for fiscal  as compared to the same prior period 
we attribute most of the increase in units sold to growers supplying us with significantly more volume  due primarily to market conditions 
we do not anticipate a significant change in the sales of tomatoes for fiscal  based on current weather conditions in florida 
partially offsetting such increases described above was a decrease in sales of mexican sourced avocados  which decreased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in mexican sourced avocados was primarily related to the decrease in the volume of mexican fruit sold by million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
in addition  mexican sourced avocados had a decrease in the average selling price per carton of approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
as mentioned above  we attribute most of this decrease in volume and price to the increase in volume of california sourced avocados in the us marketplace during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period 
sales of pineapples decreased million  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for pineapples was primarily due to a decrease in volume by when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease is primarily related to the expiration of our agreement with maui pineapple company maui in december  which was primarily related to maui exiting the pineapple business 
we do not anticipate a significant change in pineapple sales during fiscal sales of chilean sourced avocados decreased million  or for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of chilean fruit sold decreased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to the smaller chilean avocado crop in fiscal year when compared to the crop in fiscal year in addition to the increase in pounds sold  our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  experienced a decrease of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
we attribute most of this decrease in volume and price to the increase in volume of california sourced avocados in the us marketplace during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period 
calavo foods fiscal vs 
fiscal calavo foods sales for the year ended october   when compared to the same period for fiscal  increased million  or 
the significant increase in sales of our calavo foods business for the year ended october   when compared to the corresponding prior year period  is due to addition of the recently acquired rfg  which contributed approximately million for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was partially offset  by a decrease in sales related to our prepared guacamole products 
this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in total pounds sold 
the decrease in pounds sold primarily related to a decrease in the pounds sold of our frozen guacamole products  which decreased approximately  and a decrease in the sale of our refrigerated guacamole products formerly high pressure  see below  which decreased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
in an effort to enhance product safety and quality in the segment  we implemented changes in our food safety standards that added steps in our manufacturing process during the first quarter of fiscal as a result  there was a temporary disruption  which adversely impacted supply and sales in the segment 
in addition  sales were impacted  as substantially all guacamole products are now high pressured for food safety purposes and that the packaging requested from certain customers does not allow for high pressured products 
this resulted in the discontinuance of sales to some high volume  low margin customers 
the net average selling price increased during the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase is primarily related to a change in sales mix and a price increase that went into effect in july on substantially all products 
we believe that retail sales  as a percentage of total net calavo foods sales  will increase in the future 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this increase is primarily related to a increase in total pounds sold for fiscal year and an increase in the average net selling price per pound of  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in average net selling price is primarily related to a change in sales mix 
in addition  the recently acquired csl contributed approximately million for fiscal year we currently have two l ultra high pressure machines located in uruapan 
starting in fiscal year  we have begun using the two l ultra high pressure machines to pressurize all product lines within calavo foods including frozen products 
this has caused our operating capacity for these two l ultra high pressure machines to be approximately as of october  our estimated combined operating capacity for these two machines was approximately as of october  net sales of our ultra high pressure fresh products  typically sold to retail customers  represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and we believe that these ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado and other products to our customers 
consequently  we believe that we are positioned to expand our ultra high pressure product line to include more avocado related products  mangoes and other readily available fruit products 
we anticipate a marginal increase in sales related to our calavo foods 
gross margins our cost of sales consists predominantly of fruit costs  packing materials  freight and handling  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with preparing food products  and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold 
gross margins decreased by approximately million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same period for fiscal this decrease was attributable to both our fresh products and our calavo foods segments 
the following table summarizes our gross margins and gross profit percentages by business segment change change dollars in thousands gross margins fresh products calavo foods total gross margins gross profit percentages fresh products calavo foods consolidated includes gross margin of million in fiscal related to recently acquired rfg 
see note in the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition of rfg 
fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period  the decrease in our fresh products segment gross margin percentage was primarily related to higher costs associated with california sourced avocados 
this was caused by fewer pounds being sold by approximately  increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
this decrease was primarily related to the smaller california avocado crop 
contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher mexican sourced avocado fruit costs year over year by approximately 
we were able to increase the selling prices of mexican sourced avocados  but not at the same rate at which fruit costs increased 
we attribute this increase primarily to a lower overall volume of avocados in the marketplace  in conjunction with a steady to higher demand for avocados  when compared to the same prior year period 
the combined effect of these negatively impacted gross margins 
in addition  despite the recent strengthening of the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate  on a year to date basis  the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate weakened during fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
all of these combined had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our fresh and calavo foods segments 
the gross margin and or gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including certain chilean avocados and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party growers packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party  which usually is a percent of the overall selling price 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal years  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
this is a million decrease in gross margin for consigned sales compared to previous year 
this decrease is due to a decrease in tomato sales of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for tomatoes was primarily due to a decrease in volume by when compared to the same prior year period 
this significant decrease was mainly due to a freeze in mexico that resulted in less units 
in addition  tomatoes had a decrease in the average selling price per carton of approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period  the increase in our fresh products segment gross margin and gross margin percentage was primarily related to an increase in the gross margin percentage for california avocados 
this was due to a significant increase in the volume of california avocados sold  which increased 
this increase was primarily related to the larger california avocado crop 
this had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
partially offsetting this increase in gross margin was a decrease in margins for mexican sourced avocados due to a similar fruit cost year over year  but at a lower selling price  for mexican sourced avocados 
we believe this decrease in selling price is primarily related to a significantly higher volume of non mexican fruit in the u 
s marketplace  which put downward pressure on carton selling prices 
as a result of this downward pressure  we were not able to purchase mexican sourced fruit as effectively in relation to the selling price as we were able to in the same prior year period 
additionally  we experienced a decrease in the volume of mexican sourced avocados sold by million pounds or  which we believe was primarily related to the aforementioned pricing pressure 
in addition  the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate weakened during fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
all of these combined had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
as mentioned above  the weakening of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso negatively affected our gross margin for fiscal year any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our fresh and calavo foods segments 
the gross margin and gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including certain chilean avocados and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party growers packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party  which usually is a percent of the overall selling price 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction

for fiscal years  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
this is a million increase in gross margin for consigned sales compared to previous year 
this increase is due to an increase in tomato sales of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in sales for tomatoes is due to an increase in the average per carton selling price of  in addition to a increase in the number of units sold 
we attribute most of the increase in the per carton selling price to the lower volume of tomatoes in the us marketplace due to weather conditions in florida for fiscal  as compared to the same prior period 
we attribute most of the increase in units sold to growers supplying us with significantly more volume  due primarily to market conditions 
calavo foods fiscal vs 
fiscal gross profit percentages for calavo foods for the year ended october   as compared to the same prior year period  decreased primarily as a result of significantly higher fruit costs 
fruit costs increased for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute this increase primarily to a lower overall volume of avocados in the marketplace  in conjunction with a steady to higher demand for avocados  when compared to the same prior year period 
as discussed above  material fluctuations in fruit costs can have a significant impact on gross margins in the calavo foods segment 
the increase in our production costs was primarily related to the aforementioned change see net sales discussion in the food safety standards that added steps in our manufacturing process during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  in the fourth quarter of  our l ultra high pressure machine experienced a mechanical failure 
this restricted the amount of product that could be produced  which lowered our overall volume and increasing our production costs 
we have replaced this machine in the first quarter of  and believe our operating capacity to be sufficient to meet our production needs 
we anticipate that the gross profit percentage for our calavo foods segment will continue to experience significant fluctuations during the next year primarily due to the uncertainty of the cost of fruit that will be used in the production process 
partially offsetting the decrease in margins was the addition of the recently acquired rfg  which contributed approximately million in margins for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
in addition  the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate weakened during fiscal  as compared to the corresponding prior year period 
this had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
any significant fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our fresh product and calavo foods segments 
fiscal vs 
fiscal gross margin percentages for our calavo foods business are largely dependent on the pricing of our final product and the cost of avocados used in preparing guacamole 
the calavo foods gross profit percentages for the fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period  decreased million or  primarily as a result of higher fruit and operating costs  partially offset by an increase in total pounds sold by 
we anticipate that the gross profit percentage for our calavo foods segment will continue to experience significant fluctuations during the next fiscal year primarily due to the uncertainty of the cost of fruit that will be used in the production process

the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued revised guidance for the accounting of variable interest entities  which replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards approach with a qualitative approach that focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
this accounting guidance also requires an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary and requires additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities

recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the updated guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the adoption of this standard will only impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and will have no impact on the reported results

in december  the fasb issued an update to modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount
