item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information is provided in connection with  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we operate on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended april  overview we are a self advised equity real estate investment trust engaged in owning and operating income producing real properties 
our investments include multi family residential properties and commercial properties located primarily in the upper midwest states of minnesota and north dakota 
our properties are diversified in property type and location 
as of april   our real estate portfolio consisted of multi family residential properties containing  apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of annual report 
index million  and commercial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of billion 
our commercial properties consist of commercial office properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  commercial medical properties including senior housing containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  commercial industrial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial retail properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million 
our primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multi family residential and commercial leases 
our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy 
this strategy is focused on growing assets in desired geographical markets  achieving diversification by property type and location  and adhering to targeted returns in acquiring properties 
total revenues of iret properties  our operating partnership  increased by million to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new real estate properties 
we estimate that rent concessions offered to tenants during the twelve months ended april  lowered our operating revenues by approximately million  compared to million for fiscal year on an all property basis  physical occupancy levels in our total commercial property segments increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year physical occupancy rates in our commercial industrial and commercial retail segments increased  physical occupancy in our commercial office and commercial medical segments decreased 
physical occupancy in our multi family residential segment increased to in fiscal year on an all property basis  from in fiscal year we continued to experience a challenging market environment in fiscal year real estate operating fundamentals remained under pressure in our commercial office segment in particular  as the us economy and local economies in many of our markets continued to be negatively affected by a number of adverse macro conditions 
we expect that the ongoing recovery will remain slow and uneven  and that unemployment levels will remain elevated  with consequent challenges to the operating results in our commercial office segment in particular 
our multi family residential properties continue to perform well  but while we expect to see continued favorable results in this segment in fiscal year  our ability to maintain occupancy levels and selectively raise rents remains dependent on continued economic recovery and employment growth  and many economic forecasts  including those of the federal reserve  are predicting lingering high unemployment and slow growth through we plan during fiscal year to continue to pursue the selective disposition of assets in non core markets  and to work to increase our multi family residential properties in our identified core markets in the midwest 
additional information and more detailed discussions of our fiscal year operating results are found in the following sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
real estate 
real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment for impairment  if any 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
as described further below  the process of allocating property costs to its components involves a considerable amount of subjective judgments to be made by company management 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of annual report 
index its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a year estimated life for buildings and improvements and a year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and improvements that improve and or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life  generally five to ten years 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets including land  buildings and personal property  which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and considers whether there were significant intangible assets acquired for example  above and below market leases  the value of acquired in place leases  and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities  and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land  buildings  and personal property based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
the estimated fair value of the property is the amount that would be recoverable upon the disposition of the property 
techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and reference to recent sales of comparable properties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on estimated market value if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are estimated based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the company performs this analysis on a lease by lease basis 
the capitalized above market or below market intangible is amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based upon the company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the company also considers information about each property obtained during its pre acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration is received by the company and the company has no significant continuing involvement with the property sold 
real estate held for sale 
real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs 
depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale 
the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet requires management to make certain significant judgments 
the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it is probable that a sale will be consummated 
it is not unusual for real estate sales contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements  often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  or may not close at all 
due to these uncertainties  it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of the current accounting principles governing the classification of properties as held for sale prior to a sale formally closing 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements set forth in current accounting principles 
the company reports  in discontinued operations  the results of operations and the related gains or losses of a property that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and otherwise meets the classification of a discontinued operation 
impairment 
the company s long lived assets are reviewed for impairment quarterly if events or changes in circumstances such as adverse market conditions  including conditions resulting from an ongoing economic recession indicate that a long lived asset might be impaired 
judgments regarding existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and events that occur that affect the financial strength of significant tenants of the assets  including tenants who annual report 
index have filed for bankruptcy 
for long lived assets in which an impairment indicator is present  the company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long lived asset against the carrying amount of the asset  including any associated intangibles  subject to evaluation 
the evaluation of undiscounted cash flows is subjective and reflects assumptions regarding current market conditions relative to the long lived asset being evaluated  such as future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
a worsening real estate market may cause the company to re evaluate the assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
if there is an indication of impairment based on this evaluation because the expected undiscounted cash flows plus reversion are less than the asset s carrying value  impairment is recorded based on the estimated fair value typically based on a current independent appraisal of the long lived asset in comparison to its carrying value 
the results of the company s evaluation of impairment analysis could be material to the company s financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts approximately  as of april  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for deferred rents receivable arising from the straight lining of rents approximately million as of april  and from mortgage loans as of april  
the straight lining of rents receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent increases and abated rent under the leases 
certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the company records a receivable from tenants for rents that it expects to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable 
when the company acquires a property  the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation 
revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the reliability of such deferred rents receivable involves management s assumptions relating to such tenant s viability 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
expense reimbursement income revenue arising from tenant leases  which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
income taxes 
the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections of the internal revenue code 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
the company s taxable income is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following that the company s tenants perform their obligations under their leases with the company and that the company s tax and accounting positions do not change 
these factors  which impact the company s taxable income  are subject to change  and many are outside the control of the company 
if actual results vary  the company s taxable income may change

results of operations the discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and revenues total revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year revenues during fiscal year were million greater than revenues in fiscal year and revenues during fiscal year were million greater than in fiscal year for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent in fiscal from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year decrease in rental income on stabilized properties due primarily to a decrease in occupancy increase in straight line rent increase in tenant concessions for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent in fiscal from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year decrease in rental income on stabilized properties due primarily to a decrease in occupancy as illustrated above  the majority of the increase in our gross revenue for fiscal years and million and million respectively resulted from the addition of new real estate properties to the iret properties portfolio 
rental revenue in fiscal years and from stabilized properties decreased and million  respectively 
for the next months  we continue to look to acquisitions and development of new properties and recovery in our stabilized portfolio to be the most significant factors in any increases in our revenues and ultimately our net income 
however  identifying attractive acquisition possibilities remains a continuing challenge 
gain on sale of real estate the company realized a gain on sale of real estate  land and other investments for fiscal year of approximately  this compares to an approximately million gain on sale of real estate recognized in fiscal year and approximately  recognized in fiscal year properties sold in fiscal years and are detailed below in the section captioned property dispositions

we believe that noi is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit s operating real estate because it provides a measure of core operations that is unaffected by depreciation  amortization  financing and general and administrative expense 
noi does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income  net income available for commons shareholders or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance 
the following tables show real estate revenues  real estate operating expenses and noi by reportable operating segment for fiscal years  and for a reconciliation of net operating income of reportable segments to net income as reported  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the tables also show net operating income by reportable operating segment on a stabilized property and non stabilized property basis 
stabilized properties are properties owned for the entirety of the periods being compared  and  in the case of development or re development properties  which have achieved a target level of occupancy 
this comparison allows the company to evaluate the performance of existing properties and their contribution to net annual report 
index income 
management believes that measuring performance on a stabilized property basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how the company s properties are performing year over year 
management uses this measure to assess whether or not it has been successful in increasing net operating income  renewing the leases of existing tenants  controlling operating costs and appropriately handling capital improvements 
the discussion below focuses on the main factors affecting real estate revenue and real estate expenses from stabilized properties  since changes from one fiscal year to another in real estate revenue and expenses from non stabilized properties are due to the addition of those properties to the company s real estate portfolio  and accordingly provide less useful information for evaluating the ongoing operational performance of the company s real estate portfolio

an analysis of noi by segment follows 
multi family residential real estate revenue from stabilized properties in our multi family residential segment increased by approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year approximately million of this increase was due to increased occupancy across our multifamily portfolio  increased occupancy in some instances allows for rental rate increases  which accounted for approximately million of additional revenue in this segment in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the remainder of the real estate revenue increase is attributable to a decrease of  in allowances and concessions and an increase of  in other fee revenue items 
real estate expenses at stabilized properties decreased by  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the mild winter season permitted overall lower utilities usage for a reduction in expense of approximately  and reduced snow removal expenses by  additionally  of the  decrease in real estate expenses in this segment in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  approximately  was due to lower property management expense  which includes lower fees to third party managers  savings from the company s internal marketing initiative and less bad debt write off

ladysmith pamida ladysmith  wi total property dispositions funds from operations iret considers funds from operations ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit 
iret uses the definition of ffo adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
in addition  in october nareit clarified its computation of ffo so as to exclude impairment charges for all periods presented 
because of limitations of the ffo definition adopted by nareit  iret has made certain interpretations in applying the definition 
iret believes all such interpretations not specifically provided for in the nareit definition are consistent with the definition 
iret management considers that ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  is useful to investors in providing an additional perspective on iret s operating results 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation  that the value of real estate assets decreases predictably over time 
however  real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
nareit s definition of ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  reflects the fact that depreciation charges required by gaap may not reflect underlying economic realities 
additionally  the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  assists iret management and investors in identifying the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of iret s investments  and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
ffo is used by iret s management and investors to identify trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
while ffo is widely used by reits as a primary performance metric  not all real estate companies use the same definition of ffo or calculate ffo in the same way 
accordingly  ffo presented here is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of iret s performance  but rather should be considered as an additional  supplemental measure  and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
annual report 
index ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of iret s needs or its ability to service indebtedness or make distributions 
ffo applicable to common shares and limited partnership units for the fiscal year ended april  was million  compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended april  and  respectively

ffo is calculated on a per share and unit basis 
cash distributions the following cash distributions were paid to our common shareholders and upreit unitholders during fiscal years  and fiscal years quarters first second third fourth the fiscal year cash distributions decreased over the cash distributions paid during fiscal year  and fiscal year cash distributions increased over the cash distributions paid during fiscal year annual report 
index liquidity and capital resources overview the company s principal liquidity demands are maintaining distributions to the holders of the company s common and preferred shares of beneficial interest and upreit units  capital improvements and repairs and maintenance to the company s properties  acquisition of additional properties  property development  tenant improvements and debt service and repayments 
the company has historically met its short term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by its operating activities  and  from time to time  through draws on its unsecured lines of credit 
management considers the company s ability to generate cash from property operating activities  cash out refinancing of existing properties and  from time to time  draws on its line of credit to be adequate to meet all operating requirements and to make distributions to its shareholders in accordance with the reit provisions of the internal revenue code 
budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations to our real estate portfolio are also generally expected to be funded from existing cash on hand  cash flow generated from property operations  cash out refinancing of existing properties  and or new borrowings  and the company believes it will have sufficient cash to meet its commitments over the next twelve months 
however  the commercial and residential real estate markets continue to experience significant challenges including reduced occupancies and rental rates as well as restrictions on the availability of financing 
in the event of further deterioration in property operating results  or absent the company s ability to successfully continue cash out refinancing of existing properties and or new borrowings  the company may need to consider additional cash preservation alternatives  including scaling back development activities  capital improvements and renovations 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company paid distributions totaling million in cash and million in common shares pursuant to our drip to common shareholders and unitholders of the operating partnership  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and funds from operations of million 
to the extent the company does not satisfy its long term liquidity requirements  which consist primarily of maturities under the company s long term debt  construction and development activities and potential acquisition opportunities  through net cash flows provided by operating activities and its credit facilities  the company intends to satisfy such requirements through a combination of funding sources which the company believes will be available to it  including the issuance of upreit units  additional common or preferred equity  proceeds from the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured indebtedness 
however  our ability to raise funds through the sale of equity securities  the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured borrowings is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  our operating performance  and the current trading price of our common shares  and the capital and debt markets may not consistently be available at all or on terms that we consider attractive 
in particular  as a result of the economic downturn and turmoil in the capital markets  the availability of secured and unsecured loans was for a time sharply curtailed 
we cannot predict whether these conditions will recur 
as a result of general economic conditions in our markets  economic downturns affecting the ability to attract and retain tenants  unfavorable fluctuations in interest rates or our share price  unfavorable changes in the supply of competing properties  or our properties not performing as expected  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we may not be able to pay the distribution required to maintain our status as a reit  make required principal and interest payments  make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements or undertake re development opportunities with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset values 
sources and uses of cash as of april   the company had one secured line of credit with first international bank and trust  watford city  north dakota  as lead bank 
this line of credit matures on august   and had  as of april   lending commitments of million 
participants in this secured credit facility as of april  included  in addition to first international bank  the following financial institutions the bank of north dakota  first western bank and trust  dacotah bank  united community bank of north dakota  american state bank trust company annual report

as of april   the company had advanced million under the line of credit 
the line of credit has a minimum outstanding principal balance requirement of million 
the interest rate on borrowings under the facility during fiscal year was wall street journal prime rate  with a floor of and a cap of  interest only payments are due monthly based on the total amount of advances outstanding 
the line of credit may be prepaid at par at any time 
the facility includes covenants and restrictions requiring the company to achieve on a calendar quarter basis a debt service coverage ratio on borrowing base collateral of x in the aggregate and x on individual assets in the collateral pool  and the company is also required to maintain minimum depository account s totaling million with first international  of which million is to be held in a non interest bearing account 
as of april   properties with a total cost of million collateralized this line of credit 
as of april   the company believes it is in compliance with the facility covenants 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  effective june   iret properties agreed to an amendment to the line of credit to increase the interest rate spread on borrowings to the wall street journal prime rate and to lower the floor interest rate to 
all other terms of the line of credit remain unchanged 
the company maintains compensating balances  not restricted as to withdrawal  with several financial institutions in connection with financing received from those institutions and or to ensure future credit availability 
at april   the company s compensating balances consisted of the following dacotah bank  minot  north dakota  deposit of  united community bank  minot  north dakota  deposit of  commerce bank  a minnesota banking corporation  deposit of  first international bank  watford city  north dakota  deposit of million  peoples state bank of velva  north dakota  deposit of  equity bank  minnetonka  minnesota  deposit of  associated bank  green bay  wisconsin  deposit of  venture bank  eagan  minnesota  deposit of  and american national bank  omaha  nebraska  deposit of  the company has an effective shelf registration statement under which it has registered common and preferred shares of beneficial interest with an aggregate public offering price of up to million 
on january   the company entered into a continuous equity offering program under this shelf registration statement with bmo capital markets corp 
bmo as sales agent  pursuant to which the company may from time to time offer and sell its common shares of beneficial interest having an aggregate gross sales price of up to million 
sales of common shares  if any  under the program will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by iret 
during fiscal year  iret issued million common shares under this program for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds before offering expenses but after underwriting discounts and commissions of million 
we use net proceeds from the sale of common shares under this program for the repayment of borrowings under our line of credit  acquisitions and developments and general corporate purposes 
during fiscal year  iret sold million common shares under its previous continuous equity offering program with robert w 
baird co  incorporated as sales agent  for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of approximately million  before offering expenses but after underwriting discounts and commissions 
the shelf registration statement under which the company had reserved shares for issuance under this previous continuous equity offering program expired at the end of its three year life during the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  economic conditions in the united states began to show signs of improvement  but the ongoing recovery has been slow and uneven  and economic forecasters continue to predict lingering high unemployment 
credit markets  however  continued to be stable  with credit availability relatively unconstrained  and benchmark interest rates remaining at or near historic lows 
underwriting on commercial real estate continues to be more conservative compared to the underwriting standards employed prior to the recessionary period  however  and we continue to find recourse security more frequently required  lower amounts of proceeds available  and lenders limiting the amount of financing available to existing relationships in an effort to manage capital allocations and credit risk 
while we continue to expect to be able to refinance our maturing debt without significant issues  we also expect lenders to continue to employ conservative underwriting regarding asset quality  occupancy levels and tenant creditworthiness 
as we were in regard to fiscal year  we remain cautious regarding our ability in fiscal year to rely on cash out refinancing at levels we had achieved in recent years to provide funds for investment opportunities and other corporate purposes 
additionally  while to date there has been no material negative impact on our ability to borrow in our multi family segment  we continue to closely monitor proposals to modify the roles of the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the federal national mortgage association fannie mae in financing multi family residential properties  we consider that one of the consequences of a modification in the agencies roles could potentially be a narrowing of their lending focus away from the smaller secondary or tertiary markets which we generally target  to multi family residential properties in major metropolitan markets 
iret obtains a majority of its multi family debt from primarily freddie mac  and we continue to plan to refinance a majority of our maturing multi family debt with these two entities  so any change in annual report 
index their ability or willingness to lend going forward would most likely result in higher loan costs and or more constricted availability of financing for us 
as of april   approximately  or million of our mortgage debt maturing in the next twelve months is placed on multi family residential assets  and approximately  or million  is placed on properties in our four commercial segments 
mortgage debt maturing in the first two quarters of fiscal year totaled approximately million under a mortgage loan secured by a property in wisconsin  this loan was paid in full by the company in may despite these market uncertainties  and a continued tightening in credit standards by lenders  iret during fiscal year acquired properties with an investment cost totaling million 
in fiscal year  iret disposed of two retail properties for sales prices totaling approximately million  compared to dispositions totaling million in fiscal year the company has a distribution reinvestment and share purchase plan drip

the maximum monthly investment permitted without prior company approval is currently  the company can issue waivers to drip participants to provide for investments in excess of the  maximum monthly investment

net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to million of net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal year the increase in net cash used by investing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily a result of a decrease in proceeds from the sale of real estate coupled with an increase in expenditures for acquisitions and improvements of real estate investments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations  and secondarily to our deposits with and investments in certain products issued by various financial institutions 
variable interest rates 
because approximately of our mortgage debt  as of april  and as of april  and  respectively  is at fixed interest rates  we have little exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk on our existing mortgage debt 
however  even though our goal is to maintain a fairly low exposure to interest rate risk  we are still vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates on any future repricing or refinancing of our fixed or variable rate debt and on future debt 
we primarily use long term more than nine years and medium term five to seven years debt as a source of capital 
we do not currently use derivative securities  interest rate swaps or any other type of hedging activity to manage our interest rate risk 
as of april   we had the following amount of future principal and interest payments due on mortgages secured by our real estate 
future principal payments in thousands  except percentages long term debt thereafter total fair value fixed rate average fixed interest rate variable rate average variable interest rate future interest payments in thousands long term debt thereafter total fixed rate variable rate as of april   the weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate and variable rate loans was and  respectively

any fluctuations in variable interest rates could increase or decrease our interest expenses
