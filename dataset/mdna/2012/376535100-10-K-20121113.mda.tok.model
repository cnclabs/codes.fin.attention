item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
except per share amounts  dollar amounts are in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
overview general we were incorporated under the maryland general corporation laws on may  our board of directors approved revisions to our investment objectives as noted below and strategies  effective on or about january  see recent developments board of director actions for more information 
our investment objectives are to achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses  make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time  and provide our stockholders with long term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company bdc under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
in addition  for federal tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ric under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
business environment while economic conditions generally appear to be improving  we remain cautious about a long term economic recovery 
the recent recession in general  and the disruptions in the capital markets in particular  have impacted our liquidity options and increased our cost of debt and equity capital 
many of our portfolio companies  as well as those that we evaluate for investment  are impacted by these economic conditions  and if these conditions persist  it may affect their ability to repay our loans or engage in a liquidity event  such as a sale  recapitalization or initial public offering 
the economic conditions could also disproportionately impact some of the industries in which we have invested  causing us to be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio  which could cause the number of our non performing assets to increase and the fair market value of our portfolio to decrease 
we do not know if market conditions will continue to improve or if adverse conditions will again intensify  and we do not know the full extent to which the economic downturn will affect us 
if market instability persists or intensifies  we may experience difficulty in raising capital 
during  we experienced a net contraction in our overall portfolio  a net decrease of nine portfolio companies when compared to the year ending the primary reason was due to million in unscheduled principal payments with ten portfolio investments paying off early  but also due to fewer new investments being made during the year 
while we invested in several new proprietary and syndicate investments in  there is increased competitive pressure in the bdc and investment company marketplace for senior and senior subordinated debt resulting in lower yields for increasingly riskier investments 
going into  we will continue to focus on building our pipeline and making investments that meet our objectives and strategies and that provide appropriate returns given the risks 
subsequent to september   we have made one new investment for an aggregate total of million 
despite the challenges during these uncertain economic times  during the year ended september   we completed both a preferred stock offering and a renewal of our million line of credit our credit facility  described more fully under recent developments renewal of credit facility below 
in november  we issued million shares of term preferred stock our term preferred stock  defined under recent developments term preferred stock offering below for gross proceeds of million and in january  we closed on an amendment on our credit facility to extend its maturity until january in addition  in july  the securities and exchange commission sec granted an exemptive order that  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  expands our ability to co invest in portfolio companies with certain of our affiliated investment funds  which we believe this will enhance our ability to further our investment strategy and objectives 
see recent developments co investment order for more information 

table of contents we believe that market conditions have affected the trading price of our common stock and our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity 
on november   the closing market price of our common stock was  a discount to our september   net asset value nav per share of 
when our stock trades below nav per common share  as it has consistently traded over the last three years  our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the act  which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock below nav per common share without stockholder approval  other than through sales to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on february   our stockholders approved a proposal which authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current nav per common share subject to certain limitations including  but not limited to  that the number of shares issued and sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale for a period of one year from the date of approval  provided that our board of directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale 
at the upcoming annual stockholders meeting scheduled for february   our stockholders will again be asked to vote in favor of renewing this proposal for another year 
challenges in the current market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the code and the act  as well as contractual restrictions under the agreement governing our credit facility that further constrain our ability to access the capital markets 
to maintain our qualification as a ric  we must satisfy  among other requirements  an annual distribution requirement to pay out at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders 
because we are required to distribute our income in this manner  and because the illiquidity of many of our investments makes it difficult for us to finance new investments through the sale of current investments  our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing 
our external financing sources include the issuance of equity securities  debt securities or other leverage such as borrowings under our credit facility 
our ability to seek external debt financing  to the extent that it is available under current market conditions  is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the act that require us to have an asset coverage ratio as defined in section h of the act of at least on senior securities representing indebtedness and senior securities that are stock  which we refer to collectively as senior securities 
we expect that  given these regulatory and contractual constraints in combination with current market conditions  debt and equity capital may be costly for us to access in the near term 
however  we believe that our public offering of term preferred stock in november  our three year renewal on our credit facility and our new ability to co invest with gladstone investment corporation gladstone investment and other affiliated investment funds  will increase our ability to make investments in businesses that we believe will weather the current economic conditions and will be likely to produce attractive long term returns for our stockholders

we did not issue any common shares under this agreement 
prepaid costs of million related to the origination of this agreement were expensed in the three months ended september  
table of contents investment strategy to achieve our investment objectives  we seek to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities  with each investment generally ranging from million to million  although investment size may vary  depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment 
in general  our investments in debt securities have a term of no more than seven years  accrue interest at variable rates based on libor and  to a lesser extent  at fixed rates 
we seek debt instruments that pay interest monthly or  at a minimum  quarterly  have a success fee or deferred interest provision and are primarily interest only with all principal and any accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity 
generally  success fees accrue at a set rate and are contractually due upon a change of control in the business 
some debt securities have deferred interest whereby some portion of the interest payment is added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind pik 
typically  our equity investments consist of common stock  preferred stock  limited liability company interests  or warrants to purchase the foregoing 
often  these equity investments occur in connection with our original investment  recapitalizing a business  or refinancing existing debt 
the adviser and administrator the adviser is led by a management team which has extensive experience in our lines of business 
the adviser is controlled by david gladstone  our chairman and chief executive officer

the adviser and gladstone securities  each an affiliate of ours  receive fees for certain services they separately provide to certain of our portfolio companies 
such fees are generally paid directly to the adviser or gladstone securities  as applicable 
when the adviser receives such fees  of certain of those fees and of others are credited against the base management fee that we pay to the adviser 
gladstone securities provides certain of our portfolio companies with investment banking and due diligence services  these fees do not impact the overall fees that we pay the adviser 
the adviser also receives fees for monitoring and reviewing portfolio company investments 
these fees are recurring and are generally paid annually or quarterly in advance to the adviser throughout the life of the investment 
fees of this nature are recorded as revenue by the adviser when earned and are not credited against the base management fee 
we may receive fees for the origination and closing services we provide to portfolio companies through the adviser 
these fees are paid directly to us and are recognized as other income upon closing of the originated investment 

table of contents investment advisory and management agreement under the amended and restated investment advisory agreement advisory agreement  we pay the adviser an annual base management fee of of our average gross assets  which is defined as total assets  including investments made with proceeds of borrowings  less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings  valued at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter 
we also pay the adviser a two part incentive fee under the advisory agreement 
the first part of the incentive fee is an income based incentive fee which rewards the adviser if our quarterly net investment income before giving effect to any incentive fee exceeds of our net assets the hurdle rate 
the second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains based incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year or upon termination of the advisory agreement  as of the termination date  and equals of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year 
in determining the capital gains based incentive fee payable to the adviser  we will calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception  and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation  as applicable  with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio 
the adviser has not earned the capital gains based portion of the incentive fee since our inception

in july  our board of directors approved the renewal of the advisory agreement with the adviser through august  we expect that our board of directors will approve a further one year renewal in july administration agreement we entered into an administration agreement with the administrator the administration agreement  whereby we pay separately for administrative services 
the administration agreement provides for payments equal to our allocable portion of the administrator s overhead expenses in performing its obligations under the administration agreement including  but not limited to  rent and our allocable portion of the salaries and benefits expenses of our chief financial officer and treasurer  chief accounting officer  chief compliance officer  internal counsel and their respective staffs 
our allocable portion of expenses is derived by multiplying the administrator s total expenses by the percentage of our average assets the total assets at the beginning of each quarter in comparison to the average total assets of all companies managed by the adviser under similar agreements

liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september   was million as compared to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended september   of million 
the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in purchases of investments and the increase in scheduled and unscheduled principal repayments on investments and proceeds from sales of investments when comparing the two years 
the large increase in originations in the second half of fiscal year contributed to an increase in interest income during the year ended september  the majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the interest and principal payments on debt securities that we receive from our portfolio companies 
we utilize this cash primarily to fund new investments  make interest payments on our credit facility  make distributions to our stockholders  pay management fees to the adviser and pay for other operating expenses

distributions to qualify as a ric and thus avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required  under subchapter m of the code  to distribute at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
in accordance with these requirements  we declared and paid monthly cash distributions of per common share for each month during the years ended september  and from october through march and from april through september  we declared and paid monthly cash distributions of and per common share  respectively 
for the years ended september  and  our distribution payments were approximately million  respectively 
we declared these distributions based on our estimates of net investment income for the fiscal year 
section a disclosure our board of directors estimates the source of the distributions at the time of their declaration as required by section a of the act 
on a monthly basis  if conditions dictate under section a  we post a section a notice through the depository trust company s legal notice system lens and also send to our registered stockholders a written section a notice along with the payment of distributions for any payment which includes a distribution estimated to be paid from any source other than net investment income 
the estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on us gaap that are subject to revision  and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year 
following the calendar year end  after definitive information has been determined by us  if we have made distributions of taxable income or return of capital  we will deliver a form div to our stockholders specifying such amount and the tax characterization of such amount 
therefore  these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of section a of the act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes 
equity on october   we filed a registration statement the registration statement on form n file no 
that was amended on december   and which the sec declared effective on january  post effective amendments dated july  declared effective by the sec on january  and dated june  declared effective by the sec on june  were also filed under this registration statement 
the registration statement permits us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities  consisting of common stock  preferred stock  subscription rights  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock  including through a combined offering of such securities 
on october   pursuant to the terms of our articles of incorporation  as amended  our board of directors approved reclassifying million shares from common stock to preferred stock  in connection with our term preferred stock offering 
to date  under the registration statement  we have issued million in term preferred stock 

table of contents common stock on may   we and the adviser entered into an equity distribution agreement the agreement with bb t capital markets  a division of scott stringfellow  llc the agent  under which we could  from time to time  issue and sell through the agent  as sales agent  up to million shares of our common stock  par value per share 
at september   we had not issued any shares pursuant to this agreement and in october  we terminated this agreement 
prepaid costs of million related to the origination of this agreement were expensed in the three months ended september  we anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future 
however  we cannot determine the terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us  or at all 
additionally  when our common stock is trading below nav  as it has consistently traded over the last three years  we will have regulatory constraints under the act on our ability to obtain additional capital in this manner 
generally  the act provides that we may not issue and sell our common stock at a price below our then current nav per common share  other than to our then existing common stockholders pursuant to a rights offering  without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors 
as of september   our nav per common share was and as of november  our closing market price was per common share 
to the extent that our common stock trades at a market price below our nav per common share  we will generally be precluded from raising equity capital through public offerings of our common stock  other than pursuant to stockholder approval or a rights offering 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on february   our stockholders approved a proposal that authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current nav per common share for a period of one year  provided that our board of directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale 
we have not issued any common stock since february and have never issued common stock below nav per common share 
at the upcoming annual stockholders meeting scheduled for february  our stockholders will again be asked to vote in favor of renewing this proposal for another year

gross proceeds totaled million and net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses borne by us were approximately million and were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we incurred million in total offering costs related to these transactions  which have been recorded as an asset in accordance with gaap and amortized over the redemption period ending december  no preferred stock had been issued prior to this issuance 
our term preferred stock provides for a fixed dividend equal to per year  payable monthly which equates to approximately million per year 
we are required to redeem all of the outstanding term preferred stock on december  for cash at a redemption price equal to per share plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends  if any  to the date of redemption 
the term preferred stock has a preference over our common stock with respect to these dividends  whereby no distributions are payable on our common stock unless the stated dividends  including any accrued and unpaid dividends  on the term preferred stock have been paid in full 
in addition  there are two other potential redemption triggers for our term preferred stock if we fail to maintain an asset coverage ratio as calculated under section h of the act of at least  we are required to redeem a portion of the outstanding term preferred stock or otherwise cure the ratio redemption trigger  and at our sole option  at any time on or after december  the term preferred stock has been recorded as a liability in accordance with gaap and  as such  affects our asset coverage  exposing us to additional leverage risks

we incurred fees of million in january in connection with this amendment 
interest is payable monthly during the term of our credit facility 
available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed under our credit facility  based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by business loan  which varies as loans are added and repaid  regardless of whether such repayments are prepayments or made as contractually required 
the administrative agent also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with keybank as custodian 
keybank  who also serves as the trustee of the account  generally remits the collected funds to us once a month 
our credit facility contains covenants that require business loan to maintain its status as a separate legal entity  prohibit certain significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies 
our credit facility also limits payments on distributions to the aggregate net investment income for each of the twelve month periods ending september     and business loan is also subject to certain limitations on the type of loan investments it can apply toward availability credit in the borrowing base  including restrictions on geographic concentrations  sector concentrations  loan size  distribution payout  payment frequency and status  average life and lien property 
our credit facility further requires business loan to comply with other financial and operational covenants  which obligate business loan to  among other things  maintain certain financial ratios  including asset and interest coverage and a minimum number of obligors required in the borrowing base of the credit agreement

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we have lines of credit with certain of our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn or called  respectively 
since these commitments have expiration dates and we expect many will never be fully drawn  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

as of september   we had one guarantee outstanding to viapack up to a maximum of million 
as of september   we have not been required to make any payments on this guarantee and we consider the credit risks to be remote

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified our investment valuation process  as our most critical accounting policy 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our accompanying consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
general valuation policy we value our investments in accordance with the requirements of the act 
as discussed more fully below  we value securities for which market quotations are readily available and reliable at their market value 
we value all other securities and assets at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
asc provides a consistent definition of fair value that focuses on exit price in the principal  or most advantageous  market and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
asc also establishes the following three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active or inactive markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs are in those markets for which there are few transactions  the prices are not current  little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers  and level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and reflect assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
level inputs can also include our own assumptions based upon the best available information 
see note investments in the accompanying notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our adoption of asc 
table of contents we use generally accepted valuation techniques to value our portfolio unless we have specific information about the value of an investment to determine otherwise 
from time to time we may accept an appraisal of a business in which we hold securities 
these appraisals are expensive and occur infrequently but provide a third party valuation opinion that may differ in results  techniques and scopes used to value our investments 
when these specific third party appraisals are engaged or accepted  we would use estimates of value provided by such appraisals and our own assumptions including estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities  as of the measurement date  to value our investments 
in determining the value of our investments  the adviser has established an investment valuation policy the policy 
the policy has been approved by our board of directors  and each quarter our board of directors reviews whether the adviser has applied the policy consistently and votes whether or not to accept the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
the policy  which is summarized below  applies to the following categories of securities publicly traded securities  securities for which a limited market exists  and securities for which no market exists 
valuation methods publicly traded securities we determine the value of publicly traded securities based on the closing price for the security on the exchange or securities market on which it is listed and primarily traded on the valuation date 
to the extent that we own restricted securities that are not freely tradable  but for which a public market otherwise exists  we will use the market value of that security adjusted for any decrease in value resulting from the restrictive feature 
as of september  and  we did not have any investments in publicly traded securities 
securities for which a limited market exists we value securities that are not traded on an established secondary securities market  but for which a limited market for the security exists  such as certain participations in  or assignments of  syndicated loans  at the quoted bid price  which are non binding 
in valuing these assets  we assess trading activity in an asset class  evaluate variances in prices and other market insights to determine if any available quote prices are reliable 
if we conclude that quotes based on active markets or trading activity may be relied upon  firm bid prices are requested  however  if a firm bid price is unavailable  we base the value of the security upon the indicative bid price ibp offered by the respective originating syndication agent s trading desk  or secondary desk  on or near the valuation date 
to the extent that we use the ibp as a basis for valuing the security  the adviser may take further steps to consider additional information to validate that price in accordance with the policy  including but not limited to reviewing a range of indicative bids to the extent the adviser has ready access to such qualified information 
in the event these limited markets become illiquid such that market prices are no longer readily available  we will value our syndicated loans using alternative methods  such as estimated net present values of the future cash flows or discounted cash flows dcf 
the use of a dcf methodology follows that prescribed by asc  which provides guidance on the use of a reporting entity s own assumptions about future cash flows and risk adjusted discount rates when relevant observable inputs  such as quotes in active markets  are not available 
when relevant observable market data does not exist  the alternative outlined in asc is the valuation of investments based on dcf 
for the purposes of using dcf to provide fair value estimates  we consider multiple inputs such as a risk adjusted discount rate that incorporates adjustments that market participants would make both for nonperformance and liquidity risks 
as such  we develop a modified discount rate approach that incorporates risk premiums including  among others  increased probability of default  or higher loss given default  or increased liquidity risk 
the dcf valuations applied to the syndicated loans provide an estimate of what we believe a market participant would pay to purchase a syndicated loan in an active market  thereby establishing a fair value 
we apply the dcf methodology in illiquid markets until quoted prices are available or are deemed reliable based on trading activity 
as of september  and  we determined that the indicative bid prices were reliable indicators of fair value for our syndicate investments 
however  because of the private nature of this marketplace meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported  we believe that these valuation inputs are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc 
table of contents securities for which no market exists the valuation methodology for securities for which no market exists falls into four categories portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities  portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of securities  which can include debt and equity securities  portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities  and portfolio investments comprised of non publicly traded non control equity securities of other funds 
portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities debt securities that are not publicly traded on an established securities market  or for which a limited market does not exist non public debt securities  and that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity or equity like securities  are fair valued utilizing opinions of value submitted to us by standard poor s securities evaluations  inc spse 
we may also submit paid in kind pik interest to spse for their evaluation when it is determined that pik interest is likely to be received 
in the case of non public debt securities  we have engaged spse to submit opinions of value for our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies in which we own no equity  or equity like securities 
spse will only evaluate the debt portion of our investments for which we specifically request evaluation  and may decline to make requested evaluations for any reason at its sole discretion 
upon completing our collection of data with respect to the investments which may include the information described below under credit information  the risk ratings of the loans described below under loan grading and risk rating and the factors described hereunder  this valuation data is forwarded to spse for review and analysis 
spse makes its independent assessment of the data that we have assembled and assesses its independent data to form an opinion as to what they consider to be the market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  spse has issued the following paragraph spse provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what spse believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects spse s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  however  spse cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimates thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  spse cannot guarantee their accuracy 
spse opinions of value of our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity or equity like securities are submitted to our board of directors along with the adviser s supplemental assessment and recommendation regarding valuation of each of these investments 
the adviser generally accepts the opinion of value given by spse  however  in certain limited circumstances  such as when the adviser may learn new information regarding an investment between the time of submission to spse and the date of the board assessment the adviser s conclusions as to value may differ from the opinion of value delivered by spse 
our board of directors then reviews whether the adviser has followed its established procedures for determinations of fair value  and votes to accept or reject the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
the adviser and our management recommended  and the board of directors voted to accept  the opinions of value delivered by spse on the loans in our portfolio as denoted on the consolidated schedule of investments included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
because there is a delay between when we close an investment and when the investment can be evaluated by spse  new loans are not valued immediately by spse  rather  management makes its own determination about the value of these investments in accordance with our valuation policy using the methods described herein 
portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities the fair value of these investments is determined based on the total enterprise value of the portfolio company  or issuer  utilizing a liquidity waterfall approach 
for non public debt securities and equity or equity like securities eg preferred equity  common equity  or other equity like securities that are purchased together as part of a package  where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security  both the debt and equity securities of the portfolio investment would exit in the mergers and acquisitions market as the principal market  generally through a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
we generally exit the debt and equity securities of one issuer together 
applying the liquidity waterfall approach to all of the investments of an issuer  we first calculate the total enterprise value of the issuer by incorporating some or all of the following factors the issuer s ability to make payments  
table of contents the earnings of the issuer  recent sales to third parties of similar securities  the comparison to publicly traded securities  and dcf or other pertinent factors 
in gathering the sales to third parties of similar securities  we may reference industry statistics and use outside experts  total enterprise value tev is only an estimate of value and may not be the value received in an actual sale 
once we have estimated the total enterprise value of the issuer  we subtract the value of all the debt securities of the issuer  which are valued at the contractual principal balance 
fair values of these debt securities are discounted for any shortfall of total enterprise value over the total debt outstanding for the issuer 
once the values for all outstanding senior securities which include the debt securities have been subtracted from the total enterprise value of the issuer  the remaining amount  if any  is used to determine the value of the issuer s equity or equity like securities 
if  in the adviser s judgment  the liquidity waterfall approach does not accurately reflect the value of the debt component  the adviser may recommend that we use a valuation by spse or  if that is unavailable  a dcf valuation technique 
portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities we value non public debt securities that are purchased together with equity or equity like securities from the same portfolio company  or issuer  for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  using a hypothetical secondary market as our principal market 
in accordance with asc as amended by the fasb s accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  asu  we have defined our unit of account at the investment level either debt or equity and as such we determine the fair value of these non control investments assuming the sale of an individual security using the stand alone premise of value 
as such  we estimate the fair value of the debt component using estimates of value provided by spse and our own assumptions in the absence of observable market data  including synthetic credit ratings  estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date 
for equity or equity like securities of investments for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  we estimate the fair value of the equity based on factors such as the overall value of the issuer  the relative fair value of other units of account including debt  or other relative value approaches 
consideration also is given to capital structure and other contractual obligations that may impact the fair value of the equity 
furthermore  we may utilize comparable values of similar companies  recent investments and indices with similar structures and risk characteristics or dcf valuation techniques and  in absence of other observable market data  our own assumptions 
portfolio investments comprised of non publicly traded non control equity securities of other funds we generally value any uninvested capital of the non control fund at par value and value any invested capital at the value provided by the non control fund 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly and materially from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security in an arms length transaction in the security s principal market 
valuation considerations from time to time  depending on certain circumstances  the adviser may use the following valuation considerations  including but not limited to the nature and realizable value of the collateral  the portfolio company s earnings and cash flows and its ability to make payments on its obligations  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  the comparison to publicly traded companies  and dcf and other relevant factors 

table of contents because such valuations  particularly valuations of private securities and private companies  are not susceptible to precise determination  may fluctuate over short periods of time  and may be based on estimates  our determinations of fair value may differ from the values that might have actually resulted had a readily available market for these securities been available 
credit information the adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
we and the adviser participate in the periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold control and affiliate investments and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements 
using these statements or comparable information and board discussions  the adviser calculates and evaluates the credit statistics 
loan grading and risk rating as part of our valuation procedures above  we risk rate all of our investments in debt securities 
for syndicated loans that have been rated by an nrsro as defined in rule a under the act  we use the nrsro s risk rating for such security 
for all other debt securities  we use a proprietary risk rating system 
our risk rating system uses a scale of to  with being the lowest probability of default 
this system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
for the debt securities for which we do not use a third party nrsro risk rating  we seek to have our risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations  such as those provided by an nrsro 
while we seek to mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that our risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as an nrsro for these securities 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because our system rates debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro  there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
we believe our risk rating would be significantly higher than a typical nrsro risk rating because the risk rating of the typical nrsro is designed for larger businesses 
however  our risk rating has been designed to risk rate the securities of smaller businesses that are not rated by a typical nrsro 
therefore  when we use our risk rating on larger business securities  the risk rating is higher than a typical nrsro rating 
the primary difference between our risk rating and the rating of a typical nrsro is that our risk rating uses more quantitative determinants and includes qualitative determinants that we believe are not used in the nrsro rating 
it is our understanding that most debt securities of medium sized companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on an nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  our scale begins with the designation as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a bbb from an nrsro  however  no assurance can be given that a on our scale is equal to a bbb on an nrsro scale 
company s system first nrsro second nrsro description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next ten years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set forth are for a ten year term debt security 
if a debt security is less than ten years  then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period  which may move the security higher on our risk rating scale 
the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
generally  when a loan becomes days or more past due or if our qualitative assessment indicates that the debtor is unable to service its debt or other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
however  we remain contractually entitled to this interest 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to the cost 
table of contents basis depending upon management s judgment 
generally non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid and in management s judgment  are likely to remain current  or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
at september   six portfolio companies were either fully or partially on non accrual with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately million  or of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio  and an aggregate fair value of approximately million  or of the fair value of all debt investments in our portfolio 
at september   eight portfolio companies were on non accrual with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately million  or of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio  and an aggregate fair value of approximately million  or of the fair value of all debt investments in our portfolio 
additionally  we do not risk rate our equity securities

as a ric  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we must meet certain source of income  asset diversification and annual distribution requirements 
under the annual distribution requirements  we are required to distribute to stockholders at least of our investment company taxable income  as defined by the code 
our policy is to pay out as distributions up to of that amount 
in an effort to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute  during each calendar year  an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year  and any ordinary income and net capital gains from preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
additionally  under the ric modernization act the ric act  we are permitted to carry forward capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after september   for an unlimited period 
however  any losses incurred during those future taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to the losses incurred in pre enactment taxable years  which carry an expiration date 
as a result of this ordering rule  pre enactment capital loss carryforwards may be more likely to expire unused 
additionally  post enactment capital loss carryforwards will retain their character as either short term or long term capital losses rather than being considered all short term as permitted under the previous regulation 

table of contents we sought and received approval for a change in accounting method from the irs related to our tax treatment for success fees 
as a result  we  in effect  will continue to account for the recognition of income from the success fees upon receipt  or when the amount becomes fixed 
prior to january   we had treated the success fee amount as a capital gain for tax characterization purposes 
however  starting january   the tax characterization of the success fee amount was and will be treated as ordinary income 
the approved change in accounting method does not require us to retroactively change the capital gains treatment of the success fees received prior to january  revenue recognition interest income recognition interest income  adjusted for amortization of premiums and acquisition costs and for the accretion of discounts  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
generally  when a loan becomes days or more past due or if our qualitative assessment indicates that the debtor is unable to service its debt or other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
however  we remain contractually entitled to this interest 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to the cost basis depending upon management s judgment 
generally  non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid and  in management s judgment  are likely to remain current  or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible

as of september  and  we had and original issue discount oid loans  respectively  primarily from the syndicated loans in our portfolio 
we recorded oid income of million for the year ended september   as compared to million for the year ended september  the unamortized balance of oid investments as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively 
as of september   we had one investment that bore pik interest and as of september   we had no investments that bore pik interest 
pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in a loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of a loan and recorded as income 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to common stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
we recorded pik income of for the year ended september   as compared to for the year ended september  we collected no pik income in cash for the years ended september  and  respectively 
we also transfer past due interest to the principal balance as stipulated in certain loan amendments with portfolio companies 
there were no such transfers during the year ended september  and we transferred past due interest to the principal balance of million for the year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   we also rolled over past due interest to a portfolio company s principal balance of million  and then recorded an adjustment against that principal balance as a contra investment since the loan was on non accrual and the collectability of the additional principal was uncertain 
as a result of a restructure  we reversed this contra investment amount of million during these principal balance adjustments had no net impact on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
other income recognition we generally record success fees upon receipt 
success fees are contractually due upon a change of control in a portfolio company and are recorded in other income in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded million of success fees during the year ended september   which resulted from the exits of gmt  rcs  northern contours and winchester 
during the year ended september   we received million in success fees from the exits of pinnacle and interfilm and the prepayment of success fees from westlake 

table of contents dividend income on preferred equity securities is accrued to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected and if we have the option to collect such amounts in cash  and it is recorded in other income in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the years ended september   and we did not record or collect any dividend income on preferred equity securities 
in addition  we received million from two legal settlements related to portfolio companies during the year ended september   that were recorded in other income 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a description and our application of recent accounting pronouncements 
our adoption of these recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands  unless otherwise indicated market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events  including those directly involving the companies whose securities are owned by us  conditions affecting the general economy  overall market changes  local  regional or global political  social or economic instability  and interest rate fluctuations 
the primary risk we believe we are exposed to is interest rate risk 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
we use a combination of debt and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques from time to time to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  however  we did not use any for fiscal years ended  or such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we target to have approximately of the loans in our portfolio at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates 
as of september   our portfolio consisted of the following variable rates with a floor fixed rates variable rates without a floor or ceiling total all of our variable rate loans have rates generally associated with either the current libor or prime rate 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net decrease in net assets resulting from operations  we have performed the following hypothetical analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet and interest rates remain constant as of september  and no further actions are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
basis point change a increase in interest income increase in interest expense net increase in net assets resulting from operations up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points a as of september   our effective average libor was 
although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net decrease increase in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from those in the hypothetical analysis in the table above 

table of contents we may also experience risk associated with investing in securities of companies with foreign operations 
some of our portfolio companies have operations located outside the us these risks include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  imposition of foreign taxes  changes in exportation regulations and political and social instability
