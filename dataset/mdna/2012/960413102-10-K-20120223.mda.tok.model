item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals  polymers and fabricated building products 
our two principal business segments are olefins and vinyls 
we use the majority of our internally produced basic chemicals to produce higher value added chemicals and building products 
consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly over the past years 
our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value added chemical products used in many end markets 
petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies 
the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics  and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates  the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials 
the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply  leading to high operating rates and margins  followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of significant capacity additions 
due to the significant size of new plants  capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed 
beginning in and continuing through  a cost advantage for natural gas based ethylene producers over naphtha based ethylene producers allowed a strong export market and higher margins for north american chemical producers  including westlake 
increased global demand for polyethylene in and resulted in increased sales volumes and improved operating margins and cash flow for our olefins segment 
however  some olefins industry consultants predict that significant increases in worldwide ethylene and ethylene derivative capacity  which have occurred over the past four years  primarily in the middle east and asia  may continue for the next several years 
as a result  our olefins segment operating margins may be negatively impacted 
weakness in the us construction markets  which began in the third quarter of  and the subsequent budgetary constraints in municipal spending  have contributed to lower domestic demand for our vinyls products 
in addition  increases in feedstock costs  combined with the industry s inability to sufficiently raise domestic prices for pvc resin and building products in order to offset cost increases  significantly impacted our vinyls segment s operating results in and since late  the pvc industry has experienced an increase in pvc resin export demand  driven largely by more competitive ethylene and energy cost positions in north america 
in addition  pvc resin capacity in japan was negatively impacted for a period following the tsunami in early  which tightened global pvc resin availability 
as a consequence  prices and margins for domestic pvc resin and building products improved in looking forward  our vinyls segment operating rates and margins may continue to be negatively impacted by the slow recovery of us construction markets and north american pvc capacity additions 
while the economic environment continues to be challenging for our customers  we believe our customer base remains generally healthy 
as we continue to manage our business in this environment  including the slowdown in construction activity  we have taken steps designed to address the changes in demand and margins in our vinyls segment and its resulting impact on our operations by matching production with sales demand and continuing to operate our plants in an efficient manner 
we continue to monitor our cost management programs and discretionary capital spending 
the impact of the global economic environment has been challenging to our business and  depending on the performance of the economy in and beyond  could have a negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we purchase significant amounts of ethane and propane feedstock  natural gas  ethylene  chlorine and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains 
we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes 
while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane and propane feedstocks  natural gas  ethylene  chlorine  salt and electricity  the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand  
table of contents capacity constraints due to construction delays  strike action or involuntary shutdowns  the general level of business and economic activity  and the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation 
significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases 
conversely  when raw material costs decrease  customers may seek immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices 
we currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs 
normally  there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived 
when this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship 
our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity  our efficient use of the capacity and our ability to increase our capacity 
since our inception  we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions  new plant construction and internal expansion 
we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs 
as noted above in item a  risk factors  we are subject to extensive environmental regulations  which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future 
further  current concern about ghg emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations  and to proposed legislation and additional regulations that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel  other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products 
while we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term  we cannot predict the longer term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
recent developments on january   we announced that we submitted a proposal to georgia gulf to acquire all of the outstanding shares of georgia gulf for per share in cash  or a total of approximately billion 
our proposal was not subject to financing conditions 
georgia gulf rejected our proposal on january  and adopted a stockholder rights plan 
on february   we announced that we were increasing our offer to per share in cash  or a total of approximately billion  with the possibility of offering our common stock as part of the offer consideration 
on that date  georgia gulf also publicly rejected our increased offer 
as of february   we held shares representing approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of georgia gulf 
in december  we announced plans to perform a major modification of the ethylene production facility at our calvert city complex 
the modification is expected to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and energy consumption 
we currently expect the modification to be completed by mid in addition  we are currently evaluating conversion from propane to ethane feedstock for our ethylene production facility at calvert city in order to capitalize on available low cost ethane and other light feedstock being developed in north america 
in august  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program totaling million 
purchases under this program may be made either through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by our cash on hand  our cash flow from operations  general market conditions and other factors 
the program may be discontinued by our board of directors at any time 
in june  as a result of excess capacity in the pvc pipe market and in an effort to reduce costs and optimize production operations  we closed our springfield pvc pipe facility 
we recorded asset impairment  severance and other costs related to the pipe facility closure of million 

table of contents in may  we completed a planned major maintenance activity  or turnaround  at our calvert city facility 
the ethylene  vcm and pvc units were shut down for a total of days each to perform the planned major maintenance activities 
the chlor alkali unit was down for a shorter period 
in april  one of the ethylene units at our lake charles facility experienced an unscheduled shut down caused by a weather related power supply failure from a third party power provider 
we restarted the ethylene unit three days later but operated the unit at reduced capacity  until we returned it to normal operations in late may 
in addition to the lost production resulting from the outage  we incurred repair costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs which negatively impacted income from operations 
in april  we announced an expansion program to increase the ethane based ethylene capacity of both of the ethylene units at our lake charles complex 
we currently expect to complete the expansion of one of the two ethylene units by late the first cracker expansion is expected to increase ethylene capacity by approximately million pounds annually  while also increasing feedstock flexibility 
the additional capacity from this expansion is expected to provide ethylene for existing internal uses and may also be sold in the merchant market 
we expect this project will be funded with cash on hand  cash flow from operations  the net proceeds from the revenue bonds of the louisiana local government environmental facility and development authority the authority  a political subdivision of the state of louisiana  and if necessary  our revolving credit facility and other external financing 
in addition  we are currently evaluating expansion plans to increase the ethane based ethylene capacity of the second ethylene unit at our lake charles complex 
in august  we announced that we intend to proceed with the previously announced construction of a new chlor alkali plant to be located at our vinyls manufacturing complex in geismar 
in december  we announced that we were increasing the planned capacity of the chlor alkali plant 
the new chlor alkali unit is designed to produce up to  ecus annually upon completion  bringing our total ecu capacity to  per year 
the new plant will improve the vertical integration of our vinyls business from chlorine downstream into vcm and pvc and increase caustic soda sales 
the project is currently targeted for start up in the second half of we expect this project will be funded with cash on hand  cash flow from operations  the net proceeds from the revenue bonds of the authority  and if necessary  our revolving credit facility and other external financing

the balance of the proceeds  plus interest income  remains with a bond trustee pursuant to the terms and provisions of the loan agreement  and is classified on our consolidated balance sheet as a non current asset  restricted cash  until such time as we request reimbursement of amounts used to expand  refurbish and maintain our facilities in calcasieu parish 
senior notes in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes are unsecured and were issued with an original issue discount of million 
there is no sinking fund and no scheduled amortization of the notes prior to maturity 
the notes are subject to redemption and the holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change of control 
all domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of ours or of another guarantor of the senior notes in excess of million are guarantors of the senior notes 
the indentures governing the senior notes contain customary covenants and events of default 
accordingly  these agreements generally impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions  among other things  provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets 
however  the effectiveness of certain of these restrictions is currently suspended because the senior notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies 
the most significant of these provisions  if it were currently effective  would restrict us from incurring additional debt  except specified permitted debt including borrowings under our credit facility  when our fixed charge coverage ratio is below these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  including  without limitation  an exception for the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to per share currently per share 
if the restrictions were currently effective  distributions in excess of million would not be allowed unless  after giving pro forma effect to the distribution  our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least and such payment  together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after january   is less than the sum of of our consolidated net income for the period from october  to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed  plus of net cash proceeds received after october  as a contribution to our common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities  plus several other adjustments 

table of contents revenue bonds in december  we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the parish of calcasieu  louisiana 
the public trust issued million principal amount of tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant 
the waste disposal revenue bonds expire in december and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions 
interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly 
the interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at december  and was and  respectively 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in addition to long term debt  we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations 
the following table summarizes our minimum payments as of december  relating to long term debt  operating leases  pension benefits funding  post retirement healthcare benefits  unconditional purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter

operating leases 
we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases primarily related to rail car leases and land for various periods 
pension benefits funding 
we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible salaried and wage employees of one subsidiary 
we expect to contribute approximately million and million in and  respectively  for plan years and funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans have not been determined for plan years and beyond 
due to the uncertainty of the funding  no amounts with respect to such plan years have been included in the table above 
long term liabilities for pension benefits were million as of december  see the discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information

see the discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
unconditional purchase obligations 
we are party to various unconditional obligations  primarily to purchase goods and services  including commitments to purchase various utilities  nitrogen  oxygen  capital items  product storage and pipeline usage 
we also have various purchase commitments for our capital projects and for materials  supplies and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business which may not be unconditional and are not reflected in the table above 
interest payments

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate 
we apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with gaap 
our more critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition  long lived assets  accruals for long term employee benefits  inventories  accounts receivable  income taxes and environmental and legal obligations 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates 
we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts 
for export contracts  the title and risk of loss passes to customers at the time specified by each contract 
provisions for discounts  rebates and returns are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded 
long lived assets 
key estimates related to long lived assets include useful lives  recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations 
such estimates could be significantly modified 
the carrying values of long lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins  new technological developments  new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages  adverse changes associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions 
we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist 
our judgments regarding the existence 
table of contents of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses 
actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated 
long lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
additionally  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long lived assets of our businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from three to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
we defer the costs of planned major maintenance activities  or turnarounds  and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected unit 
in  we completed a major turnaround at our calvert city facility 
in  we completed a turnaround at one of our ethylene units in lake charles 
total costs deferred on these turnarounds were million in and million in there were no planned major maintenance activities in amortization in  and of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   deferred turnaround costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
expensing turnaround costs would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
additional information concerning long lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
fair value estimates 
we develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition  to assess impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets and to record equity securities  derivative instruments and pension plan assets 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the engagement of third party consultants 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million  all of which was associated with the acquisition of our longview facilities 
in addition  we record all equity securities  derivative instruments and pension plan assets at fair value 
the fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market based inputs 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
long term employee benefit costs 
our costs for long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits  are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is our responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties 
it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and  if necessary  adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors 
accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match  for each employee  that estimated cost to the period worked 
to accomplish this  we rely extensively on advice from actuaries  and we make assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded 
changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts 
two of the more significant assumptions relate to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
at december   the projected pension benefit obligation was calculated using an assumed weighted average discount rate of 
the discount rate was determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate 
the return on asset assumption of is based on historical asset returns  anticipated 
table of contents future performance of the investments and financial markets and input from our third party independent actuary and the pension fund trustee 
even with the increase in the value of plan assets that occurred during  we expect funding requirements for the pension plans to increase in as a result of our accumulated benefit obligation at december  additional information on the funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
assumed healthcare trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans because benefits for participants are capped at a fixed amount 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates 
inventories 
inventories primarily include product  materials and supplies 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
the use of other methods  such as last in  first out lifo  could result in differing amounts being reported as inventories and cost of sales depending on price changes and sales turnover levels 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in our determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  and consistent with our accounting policy  we estimate the amount of accounts receivable that we believe are unlikely to be collected and we record an expense of that amount 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strength of our customers  and  in our analysis  we combine the use of historical experience  our accounts receivable aged trial balance and specific collectibility analysis 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
balances over days past due and accounts determined by our analysis of financial strength of customers to be high risk are reviewed individually for collectibility 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes 
deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
environmental and legal obligations 
we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings 
we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of our profitability tend to 
table of contents fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable 
we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products 
based on our open derivative positions at december   a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before taxes by million and a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of propane would have decreased our income before taxes by million 
additional information concerning derivative commodity instruments appear in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had variable rate debt of million outstanding 
all of the debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility none was outstanding at december  and our loan relating to the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds are at variable rates 
we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt  but we may do so in the future 
the average variable interest rate for our variable rate debt of million as of december  was 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
also  at december   we had million principal amount of fixed rate debt 
we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced 
if interest rates are higher at the time of refinancing  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
