item business 
overview we are a world leader in the production of natural products derived from microalgae  with a core competency in cultivating and processing microalgae into high value  high quality natural products for the human nutrition market 
we produce our algae in hawaii and manufacture the finished products in hawaii and california 
our products are marketed worldwide and are sold in bulk quantities to manufacturers  formulators and distributors in the health foods and nutritional supplements markets and as packaged consumer products to distributors  retailers and direct consumers 
we generated  and of our revenues outside of the united states during the years ended march   and  respectively 
competing in a global marketplace  we are influenced by the general economic conditions of the countries in which our customers operate  including adherence to our customers local governmental regulations and requirements 
since all sales are made in us currency  we have no material foreign exchange exposure 
our production levels have a significant impact on our gross profit margin  as well as our ability to meet customer demand 
because our processes are agricultural  it is important to maintain production volumes in order to support the minimal resource levels required to sustain a large scale open culture agricultural facility 
our production costs include customary variables such as availability and costs of personnel  raw materials  energy  water and freight 
these variables fluctuate based on changes in the local  national and world economies 
more complex variables include cultivation methods  feeding formulations and harvesting processes  all of which include efforts to anticipate the extent of weather and environmental events and make timely and sufficient adjustments 
although the variability of such costs cannot be fully anticipated  we have focused increased effort in this area in order to produce both spirulina and astaxanthin at levels sufficient to fully absorb production costs into inventory 
fresh water is critical for our natural astaxanthin production and  while we have not experienced any constraint on fresh water availability  future availability could be negatively impacted by significant growth in the local population as well as by throughput constraints on the water delivery infrastructure owned by the county of hawaii 
given the criticality of fresh water to our operations and the community  we recycle fresh water where possible and have developed additional water recycling systems in our efforts to utilize fresh water efficiently 
both fresh and sea water require electricity for pumping  and electricity  our single largest expenditure  depends on the cost of fuel oil which is  in turn  tied to the global price of crude oil 
in our discussion of operating results  we refer to abnormal costs 
complex biological processes in the cultivation and processing of our microalgae are influenced by factors beyond our control the weather  for example 
as a result  we cannot assure that adequate production levels will be consistent period over period 
to the extent that our production levels are not sufficient to absorb these costs on a period basis  we recognize abnormal production costs  including fixed cost variances from normal production capacity  as an expense in the period incurred 
abnormal amounts of freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage are recognized as current period charges and fixed production overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
to offset increased production costs  we seek ways to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency  and quality consistent with our commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
we utilize two third party contractors for the process of extraction for our natural astaxanthin product for the human nutrition market  and several third party contractors are utilized for both encapsulation for gelcaps and micro encapsulation for beadlets 
although these services are available from a limited number of sources  we believe that we have the ability to use other parties if any of the current contractors become unavailable 
if pricing for any of these services significantly increases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there have not been any significant changes in the cost of extraction or encapsulation services  although we continue to investigate cost effective alternatives to outsourcing 

table of contents fiscal summary net sales for the year were million  an increase of million or over the prior year  driven primarily by an increase in demand for astaxanthin products net income was million  an increase of million or  driven by the volume increase and the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset 
earnings per diluted share were for fiscal compared to per diluted share for fiscal year cash from operating activities was million  an increase of million over the prior year  resulting from the increased volume and non cash items such as stock option compensation and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash and cash equivalents at march  were million  up million from a year ago 
as a result  working capital increased to million at march  from million a year ago 
results of operations for the  and fiscal years the following tables present selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands consolidated performance summary net sales net sales increase gross profit gross profit as of net sales sg a sg a as of net sales operating income operating income as of net sales income tax benefit expense net income net sales by product spirulina net sales increase spirulina astaxanthin net sales increase astaxanthin fiscal results compared with fiscal net sales the net sales growth of in fiscal was driven largely by increased demand for bioastin  fueled by continued mainstream media attention on the health benefits of astaxanthin 
our astaxanthin sales increased over the prior year 
our spirulina products also received the benefit of positive media on its health benefits and experienced growth 
both products are sold in bulk form for use worldwide and in consumer packaged goods distributed primarily in the us we cannot predict the impact of this publicity on future period sales 
we will continue to focus on growing the market for our high quality  higher margin consumer products by emphasizing the higher nutritional content of our hawaiian spirulina and the benefits of our natural astaxanthin over synthetics  however  increased competition may result in the decline of margins in the future 
two customers accounted for of astaxanthin net sales for the year ended march  competition for sales of spirulina remains intense due to the large number of suppliers 
we expect competitive pricing pressure to continue in future periods and will continue to focus on the higher quality of hawaiian spirulina in support of customers who demand higher quality raw materials for their formulations 
conversely  because of the limited number of suppliers and increasing demand for astaxanthin  the competitive forces are currently not quite as high 
because of this  we expect current producers to increase capacity to meet this increasing demand  placing further competitive pressures on us in the future 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit percent of net sales increased by in fiscal an increase in sales of our higher margin consumer and bulk astaxanthin sales  and increased astaxanthin production accounted for the growth 
this favorable mix impact was partially offset by abnormal production costs of million in compared to million in the prior year  mostly related to spirulina production 
in fiscal  astaxanthin production levels increased by over the prior year and spirulina production levels decreased by 
the increase in astaxanthin production levels was the result of improvements to our production processes as well as generally favorable growing conditions through the third quarter of fiscal these factors combined to increase output and reduce unit costs of astaxanthin 
the decrease in spirulina production levels was driven by a morphological change in the size of the algae that inhibited successful harvests 
we recently implemented process changes and ordered additional process equipment for culture media which should gradually increase production levels and help ensure more sustainable production over the long term 
continued volatility in fuel costs in the future is likely 
therefore  we expect that electricity  water and shipping costs could be higher due to the impact of fuel cost increases for fiscal we continue to strive to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency and quality consistent with our commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by million in but decreased as a percentage of net sales by 
included in this is an increase in general and administrative expenses of million  or  due to increases in costs associated with stock option grants to key employees of  increased bonus costs of  as result of the financial performance for the year  an increase in compensation costs related to salary adjustments and new hires of  and increased recruitment costs of  sales and marketing expenses increased and made up million of the increase in operating expenses as a result of increases in commissions of  driven by sales growth  increased bonus costs of  as result of the financial performance for the year and increased advertising and promotion spending  to build our consumer business 
other expense other expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on term loans  amortization of debt issue costs and interest on other financing agreements  offset by deminimus interest earned and miscellaneous sales 
the reduction of  in is primarily due to the reduction of the principal balance on our term loans 
income taxes for fiscal we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared with an income tax benefit of  for the and tax benefits are the result of a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance and recording of a net deferred tax asset 
as a result  our effective tax rate was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
as of march   the remaining valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset is million  compared to million at the end of last year 
at march  we had a federal net operating loss carry forward of million and state net operating losses of million and million for hawaii and california  respectively 
fiscal results compared with fiscal net sales the net sales growth of in fiscal over was driven by fourth quarter mainstream media attention to the health benefits of spirulina and astaxanthin 
our spirulina products experienced growth and our astaxanthin sales increased over the prior year 
two customers accounted for of astaxanthin net sales for the year ended march  gross profit our gross profit percent decreased by in fiscal from due to lower average selling prices  lower production levels and an increase in inventory reserves during fiscal also contributing to the decline  abnormal production costs of 
million in not experienced in the prior year  mostly related to spirulina production 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were relatively flat and decreased as a percent of sales by over as a result of a focus on cost containment 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  due to costs associated with the separation of the former chief executive officer in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased  or over  due to expanded advertising and promotional programs to increase consumer product sales in the mainland us market 
other expense other expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on term loans  amortization of debt issue costs and interest on other financing agreements  offset by deminimus interest earned and miscellaneous sales 
the reduction of  in is primarily due to the reduction of the principal balance on our term loans 
income taxes for fiscal we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared with an income tax expense of  for the tax benefit is the result of a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance and recording of a net deferred tax asset at march  as a result  our effective tax rate was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
in fiscal year  fully reserved deferred tax assets were utilized to reduce taxable income  resulting in the low tax rate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity funds generated by operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity for normal working capital requirements and for funding of a normal level of investment in equipment  leasehold improvements and system upgrades 
based upon our current operating plan  analysis of our consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations  we believe that our operating cash flows and existing cash balances will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements  debt service and planned capital expenditures  for the next months 
we use estimates of future financial results including projected revenue  expenses  borrowings  and capital expenditures in reaching our conclusions 
such estimates are subject to change based on future results and such change could cause future results to vary significantly from expected results presented in this form k 
any significant investments in capital equipment related to capacity expansion may not be able to be funded from operating activities and available cash  and may require additional debt or equity funding 
our results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control and could cause future results of operations to fluctuate materially as it has in the past 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes to our largest customers  weather patterns  increased competition  increased materials  nutrient and energy costs  government regulations and other factors beyond our control 
a significant portion of our expense levels are relatively fixed  so the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on forecasts of future sales 
if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
we may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations
