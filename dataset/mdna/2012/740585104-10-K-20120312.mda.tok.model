item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pgi has been a global leader in virtual meetings for years 
our cloud based solutions deliver multi point  real time virtual collaboration using video  voice and file sharing technologies to help businesses worldwide be more productive  mobile and green 
we have a global presence in countries in our three segments in north america  europe and asia pacific 
during  we continued our strategy to transition pgi to a focused virtual meeting company with the launch of our imeet and globalmeet solutions 
on october   we completed the sale of our pgisend business 
during  we classified our maritime notification and reminder solutions operations as a disposal group held for sale  which was fully disposed of during our continuing operations reflect only our meeting solutions 
as a result and except as provided herein  the following discussion and analysis reflects our results from continuing operations 
key highlights of our financial and strategic accomplishments for include generated approximately and volume growth for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  compared to the same periods in  reported our highest revenue growth in three years  with net revenues increasing more than as compared to  amended our bank credit facility with increased capacity  an extended term and lower pricing  repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market for approximately million at an average price of  and established a new open market share repurchase program for up to million shares of our common stock 
our primary corporate objectives in are focused on continuing to increase awareness and adoption of our virtual meeting solutions  imeet and globalmeet  in the market  develop and release enhancements to imeet and globalmeet to increase their functionality and improve their competitive positioning  and transition our customer base toward a saas pricing model 
we believe these strategic initiatives will increase the addressable market opportunity for pgi and our solutions 
in  approximately of our consolidated net revenues were generated in countries outside the united states 
because we generate a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from our international operations  movements in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results 
we estimate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates during favorably impacted our consolidated net revenues by approximately million as compared to we have historically generated net revenue growth in our meeting solutions 
the average rate per minute that we charge our audio conferencing customers continues to decline while total minutes sold continues to increase 
we believe that this trend is consistent with the industry  and we expect it to continue in the foreseeable future 
our business trends and revenue growth continue to be affected by the challenging economic climate  higher global unemployment and lower global business activity 
despite these economic headwinds  our consolidated net revenues increased to million in as compared to million in  primarily due to our volume growth 
we have historically used our cash flows from operating activities for debt repayments  capital expenditures  stock repurchases  acquisitions and strategic investments 
as of december   we had utilized approximately million of indebtedness under our credit facility 
in december  we amended our credit facility to increase the overall borrowing capacity to million  extend the maturity of the credit facility to december and reduce the applicable interest rates across the pricing grid 
see capital resources for a description of our credit facility 
in addition  we intend to continue to prudently invest in our virtual meeting solutions  specifically in technology innovation and platform development  as well as new market strategies to better meet the needs of our large  global enterprise customers and to better attract  engage and acquire small and medium size business customers 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the estimates 
see the section in this annual report entitled critical accounting policies

the decrease in consolidated research and development expenses in are primarily a result of reduced personnel related costs and differences in the nature of projects for that department 
we are able to capitalize many of the costs incurred associated with enhancements to our virtual meeting solutions  which results in a higher capitalization rate of such personnel costs for the increase in consolidated research and development expenses in is primarily associated with additional resources invested in the maintenance and support of our various solutions and new product development relating primarily to our imeet and our globalmeet services

our million interest rate swap  which had a fixed rate of  expired in august  and our remaining interest rate swap expired in august as of december   we do not have any outstanding interest rate swaps 
we did not initially designate these interest rate swaps as hedges and  as such  we did not account for them under hedge accounting 
during the fourth quarter of  we prospectively designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our interest rate risk associated with our credit facility using the long haul method of effectiveness testing 
concurrent with the refinancing of our credit facility in may  we dedesignated the cash flow hedge associated with our remaining interest rate swap 
any changes in fair value prior to designation as a hedge  subsequent to dedesignation as a hedge  and any ineffectiveness while designated were recognized as unrealized gain on change in fair value of interest rate swaps as a component of other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations and amounted to a gain of million and million in and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   we had million of cash and equivalents 
we generated positive operating cash flows from each of our geographic segments for the year ended december  each geographic business segment had sufficient cash flows from operations to service existing debt obligations  to fund capital expenditure requirements which historically have been to of annual consolidated net revenues and to fund research and development expenses for new services and enhancements to existing services which historically have been to of annual consolidated net revenues 
assuming no material change to these costs  which we do not anticipate  we believe that we will generate adequate operating cash flows for capital expenditures and contractual commitments and to satisfy our indebtedness and fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
at december   we had million of available credit on our credit facility  without regard to the uncommitted million accordion feature 
we have historically borrowed on our credit facility in order to fund stock repurchases and acquisitions

cash provided by operating activities consolidated operating cash flows from continuing operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

the primary uses of cash for financing activities in included million of net payments on our credit facility and million in treasury stock purchases 
capital resources our credit facility consists of a million revolver  a million term a loan and an uncommitted million accordion feature 
our subsidiary  ats  is the borrower under our credit facility  with pgi and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries guaranteeing the obligations of ats under the credit facility  which is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our material domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  we have pledged as collateral all of the issued and outstanding stock of our material domestic subsidiaries and of our material foreign subsidiaries 
proceeds drawn under our credit facility can be used for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the annual interest rate applicable to borrowings under our credit facility  at our option  is the base rate the greater of either the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent  the prime rate or one month libor plus one and one half percent plus an applicable percentage that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio at quarter end  or libor for one  two  three  nine or twelve months adjusted for a percentage that represents the federal reserve board s reserve percentage plus an applicable percentage that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio at quarter end 
the applicable percentage for base rate loans and libor loans were and  respectively  at december  under our credit facility 
our interest rate on libor loans  which comprised materially all of our outstanding borrowings as of december   was

as of december   the rate applied to the unused portion of our credit facility was 
our credit facility contains customary terms and restrictive covenants  including financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility 
at december   we have utilized million of our million credit facility  with million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates on interest payments associated with our credit facility 
as of december   we have no outstanding interest rate swaps 
at the scheduled maturity of our credit facility in december  or in the event of an acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility following an event of default  the entire outstanding principal amount of the indebtedness under the facility  together with all other amounts payable thereunder  will become due and payable 
we may not have sufficient funds to pay such obligations in full at maturity or upon such acceleration 
if we default and are not able to pay any such obligations due  our lenders have liens on substantially all of our assets and could foreclose on our assets in order to satisfy our obligations 
as of december   we had million in cash and equivalents compared to million as of december  cash balances residing outside of the united states as of december  were million compared to million as of december  as we generate positive cash flows from each of our geographic operating segments  we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations or repay domestic obligations 
however  if these funds are needed for our operations in the united states  we could be required to pay additional us taxes to repatriate these funds 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash and cash equivalents available in the locations where they are needed  and  when advantageous  may access foreign cash or cash equivalents in a tax efficient manner 
we receive cash for repayment of royalties and management fees charged to international locations from the united states 
we record foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from these transactions in other  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
we generally consider intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries to be permanently invested for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we record foreign currency exchange fluctuations resulting from these transactions in the cumulative translation adjustment account on our consolidated balance sheets 
based on our potential cash position and potential conditions in the capital markets  we could require repayment of these intercompany loans despite the long term intention to hold them as permanent investments 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  in thousands amounts committed there after contractual obligation current borrowings on credit facility   operating leases     telecommunications service agreements   restructuring costs   capital leases and interest    credit facility commitment fees and interest      asset retirement obligation  acquisitions the table above excludes million of uncertain tax positions because we are unable to determine when  or if  payment of these amounts will be made 
excise and sales tax some of our solutions may be subject to telecommunications excise tax and sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers 
during the years ended december  and  we paid million and million  respectively  of tax and interest related to the settlement of these state excise and sales tax contingencies 
we have reserves for certain state excise and sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation 
these contingencies are included in accrued taxes  other than income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december  and december   we had reserved million and million  respectively  for certain state excise and sales tax contingencies and interest 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies 
in the event that actual results differ from these reserves  we may need to make adjustments  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  states may disagree with our method of assessing and remitting such taxes or additional states may subject us to inquiries regarding such taxes 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  legal contingencies and derivative instruments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from continuing operations consist primarily of usage fees generally based on per minute  and prior to our discontinued reclassifications  per fax page or per transaction methods 
to a lesser extent  we charge subscription based and license fees and have fixed period minimum revenue commitments 
unbilled revenue consists of earned but unbilled revenue that results from non calendar month billing cycles and the one month lag time in billing related to certain of our services 
deferred revenue consists of payments made by customers in advance of the time services are rendered 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable prior to the recognition of revenue  we make a decision that collectability is reasonably assured 
in estimating uncollectible amounts  management considers factors such as historical and anticipated customer payment performance and industry specific economic conditions 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets and long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an annual impairment review 
we completed these reviews as of december   and based on our calculations this year  the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 
we did not recognize an impairment of our goodwill during with our pgisend sale  but we did dispose of goodwill associated with that business in connection with the sale 
we recognized an impairment of our goodwill in associated with the sale of our pgimarket business 
see discontinued operations 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets  and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the discounted estimated future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
net intangible assets and goodwill totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
future events could cause us to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes income taxes are determined under the asset and liability method as required by accounting standards codification  or asc   income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using existing tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary items are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have established valuation allowances of million at december  and million at december  our valuation allowance at december  primarily relates to certain federal and state capital loss carryforwards and foreign and state net operating losses 
current evidence suggests we will not realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character on a jurisdictional basis within the carryforward period to allow us to realize the deferred tax benefits for which we have established a valuation allowance 
net of these valuation allowances  our deferred tax asset as of december  was million and our net deferred tax liability as of december  was million 
we believe that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the tax benefits related to all other deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets
