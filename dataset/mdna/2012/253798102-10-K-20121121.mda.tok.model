item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and other information in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  overview we are a leading provider of machine to machine mm networking solutions that enable the connection  monitoring and control of local or remote physical assets by electronic means 
these networking products and solutions can connect communication hardware to a physical asset and convey information about the asset s status and performance which can be sent to a computer system and used to improve or automate one or more processes 
as wireless communications become more and more prevalent  increasingly these products and solutions are deployed via wireless networks 
our hardware products have been the historical foundation of our business 
in  we introduced a cloud based internet platform idigi which our customers can utilize to monitor and control electronic devices 
our idigi device cloud provides customers with a platform to securely aggregate and to host data transmitted by remote electronic devices and to connect enterprise applications to these devices 
we also assist customers by providing application development and hosting services as well as consulting and integration services 
these applications and services ease the deployment of mm communications solutions 
our wireless product design and development services offered by our spectrum design services subsidiary provides customers turn key wireless networking products that can use a wide range of wireless technology platforms 
our products are deployed by a wide range of businesses and institutions as any business that utilizes a significant number of devices in the conduct of their business may realize benefits from mm networking 
we have a single operating and reporting segment 
our revenues consist of products that are in non embedded and embedded product categories 
non embedded products are connected externally to a device or larger system to provide wired or wireless network connectivity or port expansion 
embedded products are used by a product developer to build an electronic device in which the product provides processing power  wired ethernet  or wireless network connectivity to that device 
the products included in the non embedded product category include cellular products  wireless communication adapters  console and serial servers  usb connected products and serial cards 
the products included in the embedded product category include modules  single board computers  chips  software and development tools  idigi services  software applications and related services  custom hardware design services and satellite communication products 
we utilize many financial  operational  and other metrics to evaluate our financial condition and financial performance 
below we highlight the fiscal metrics that we feel are most important in these evaluations net sales were approximately million 
our net sales were million in fiscal  and decreased by million  or  compared to net sales of approximately million in fiscal the majority of the decrease was attributable to wired product net sales which decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal gross margin was 
our gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase primarily resulted from a reduction in the amortization of purchased and core technology as certain intangibles were fully amortized  reduced costs through the restructuring of european operations and cost reduction initiatives for the production of our products 
these impacts were partially offset by increased costs to operate the idigi device cloud and increased expenses associated with mitigating the effects of flooding in thailand in october which impacted a significant contract manufacturer 
net income was million and earnings per diluted share were 
our net income was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to net income of million in fiscal earnings per diluted share were in fiscal compared to in fiscal earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we believe that the presentation of ebitda as a percentage of net sales  which is a non gaap financial measure  is useful because it provides a reliable and consistent approach to measuring our performance from year to year and in assessing our performance against that of other companies 
we also believe this information helps compare operating results and corporate performance exclusive of the impact of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
ebitda is also used as an internal metric for executive compensation  as well as incentive compensation for the rest of the employee base  and it is monitored quarterly for these purposes 
our ebitda were million  or of net sales in fiscal compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal below is a table reconciling net income to ebitda in thousands 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year ended september  net income interest income  net income tax provision depreciation and amortization earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization our balance sheet and cash from operations remained strong 
our current ratio was to at september  compared to to at september  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million to million at september   from million at september  on july  our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to million of our common stock see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we accomplished a number of key initiatives in fiscal and also faced significant challenges relative to our business 
accomplishments we continued to generate strong  positive cash flows even as revenues fell short of expectations 
we believe our strong cash position provides a solid foundation for growing our business 
we announced important strategic relationships with freescale and wind river that we believe will advance our business to become the leading mm solutions provider 
each relationship will provide connectivity to our idigi device cloud in products that use freescale  via our relationship with wind river  intel technology  respectively 
this will allow developers and oems to build connected products and cloud enabled services more rapidly 
we believe that these types of relationships signal the beginning of a market strategy that will promote sales of broader mm solutions that include hardware  cloud based software services and professional services 
we restructured our sales organization and invested in solution sales capabilities to more aggressively sell broader based mm solutions 
as a result of this restructuring  we eliminated employment positions in our work force and hired new employees or re assigned existing employees into newly created positions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
challenges during fiscal we completed sales on many significant customer projects 
during fiscal we were unable to close on a similar level of project based sales opportunities 
this issue was most pronounced in north america and europe 
the global economic environment  most notably in europe  continued to be volatile in fiscal this also adversely impacted our financial results 
we experienced an unexpected decline in sales of our rabbit products during fiscal and now believe this product line is maturing one to two years earlier than anticipated 
flooding at a thailand based contract manufacturer in october disrupted our business temporarily 
while this did not impact our revenues or margins materially  it did have some negative impact on our expenses within cost of goods sold 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth selected information derived from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales and as a percentage of change from year to year for the years indicated 
in thousands year ended september  increase decrease compared to compared to net sales cost of sales exclusive of amortization of purchased and core technology shown separately below amortization of purchased and core technology gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income net sales net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily was due to a lower than anticipated closure rate of large new customer projects  most notably in north america and emea  and unfavorable economic conditions  most notably in europe 
in addition  our rabbit branded product line matured and net sales began to decline one to two years earlier than anticipated 
we believe that our serial servers  rabbit branded modules  chips and usb products are mature products and we expect that net sales of these products will continue to decrease in the future 
we did not experience a material change in revenue due to pricing during fiscal net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or  primarily due to a million increase in the net sales of modules  cellular products  engineering design services  serial servers  chips and idigi services 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in net sales of serial cards  usb devices  wireless communication adapters and satellite related products 
the increase in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily driven by increased unit volume as a result of increased customer sales  many of which were wireless 
we did not experience a material change in revenue due to pricing during fiscal fluctuation in foreign currency rates compared to the prior year s rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of million in fiscal in fiscal we had a favorable impact on net sales of million and in fiscal we had an unfavorable impact of million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales by non embedded and embedded product categories the following summarizes our net sales by non embedded and embedded product categories net sales of net sales in millions non embedded embedded total net sales non embedded products non embedded products net sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was mostly due to a reduction in net sales of cellular products  serial servers  wireless communication adapters and usb products 
we believe that the serial servers and usb products are in the mature phase of their product life cycle and we expect the net sales of these products to continue to decrease in the future 
non embedded products net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to increases in cellular products and serial servers 
this was partially offset by decreases in sales of serial cards  wireless communication adapters and usb connected products 
usb connected product net sales decreased due to softening of the retail sector for retail point of sale related usb applications in fiscal increased sales to customers in the medical and fleet industries contributed to the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal embedded products embedded products net sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net sales of rabbit branded modules  chips and engineering design services 
this was offset partially by increased net sales of digi branded modules  idigi services and satellite related products 
we believe that the rabbit branded products and chips are in the mature phase of their product life cycle and we expect the net sales of these products to continue to decrease in the future 
embedded products net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due mostly to increases of net sales of modules  engineering design services and chips 
increased sales to customers in the medical industry contributed to the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales by wireless and wired product categories the following table presents our revenue by wireless and wired categories net sales of net sales in millions wireless wired total net sales wireless product net sales decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal despite this decrease  wireless product net sales as a percentage of our total net sales increased in fiscal we believe this is because of our continued investment and focus on wireless mm products and solutions 
as is the trend with respect to the use of telecommunications generally  we anticipate that our sales of wireless products will continue to increase as a percentage of net sales 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales by geographic location our net sales by geographic location of our customers is as follows net sales of net sales in millions north america europe  middle east africa asian countries latin america total net sales north america net sales in fiscal decreased million  or  due to lower net sales of non embedded products of million 
this was offset partially by an increase in net sales of embedded products of million 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal compared to the prior year largely was due to a lower than anticipated closure rate on large projects 
north america net sales in fiscal increased million  or  due to an increase of million in net sales of embedded products 
the north american sales for fiscal increased over the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of large project based sales  many of which were for wireless products 
emea net sales decreased million  or  in fiscal from fiscal this primarily was due to poor economic conditions in the emea market  a lower than anticipated closure rate on large projects and the weakening of the euro 
net sales in emea increased million  or  in fiscal over fiscal mostly due to large project based sales 
the strengthening of the euro and british pound contributed million to the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal asian countries revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal from fiscal mostly related to net sales of non embedded products 
net sales in asian countries increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal mostly related to net sales of rf modules in the embedded product grouping 
latin america revenue decreased slightly by million  or  in fiscal from fiscal latin america revenue increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to non embedded cellular products 
net sales by distribution channel the following table presents our revenue by distribution channel net sales of net sales in millions direct oem channel distributors channel total net sales during fiscal  net sales by our distributors decreased by million  or compared to net sales in fiscal net sales in fiscal in our direct oem channel increased by million  or compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in net sales in the distributors channel compared to the direct oem channels was due to lower net sales of mature non embedded products  lower than anticipated closure rate on large projects  and foreign currency impacts 
net sales in our direct oem channel increased million  or compared to net sales in fiscal during fiscal  net sales by our distributors increased by million  or compared to net sales in fiscal increased customer sales to targeted industries contributed to the increase in net sales by both our distributors and our direct oem channel 
international sales growth also contributed to the increase by our distributors 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit compared to gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
the gross margin for fiscal was compared to in fiscal  an increase of percentage points 
the increase primarily resulted from a reduction in the amortization of purchased and core technology as certain intangibles were fully amortized  reduced costs through the restructuring of european operations and cost reduction initiatives for the production of our products 
amortization of purchased and core technology was million or of net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal these aggregated impacts were partially offset by increased costs to operate the idigi device cloud and increased expenses associated with mitigating the effects of flooding in thailand in october which impacted a significant contract manufacturer 
compared to gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the gross margin for fiscal was compared to in fiscal gross margin increased percentage points primarily due to product cost reduction initiatives that allowed us to reduce the cost of our products and increase gross profit through purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies during the fiscal year 
favorable customer and product mix  as well as a decrease in the amortization of purchased and core technology as certain intangibles were fully amortized  also contributed to the increase in gross profit during fiscal amortization of purchased and core technology was million or of net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal operating expenses compared to operating expenses were essentially flat at million in fiscal and million in fiscal below is a summary of our operating expenses by function 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million or  compared to million in fiscal commission expense decreased by million  partially offset by a million increase in other compensation related expenses 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million or  compared to million in fiscal compensation expenses were reduced by million resulting primarily from lower incentive compensation payouts compared to the prior fiscal year  as well as lower headcount 
in addition  professional services decreased by million compared to the prior fiscal year 
this was partially offset by an increase of million in other miscellaneous research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in both fiscal and general and administrative expenses decreased by million in amortization expense as certain intangible assets are now fully amortized 
compensation related expenses decreased by million due to a decrease in headcount and lower incentive compensation payouts 
this was offset by increases of million in bad debt expense  million in professional fees and million in other general and administrative expenses 
restructuring expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million  compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million related to our restructuring that was announced on april  in addition  we recorded an additional million related to the breisach  germany restructuring announced on july  in fiscal we recorded million related to the above mentioned restructuring for breisach  germany 
for further information on restructuring  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
compared to operating expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or  compared to million in fiscal below is a summary of our operating expenses by function 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or  compared to million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased by million for compensation related expenses due to increased headcount and full reinstatement of our non sales incentive program and million for outside services  travel and entertainment and miscellaneous other sales and marketing expenses 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or  compared to million in fiscal research and development expenses increased by million for compensation related expenses due to increased headcount and full reinstatement of our non sales incentive program  million for other research and development expenses mostly related to the investment in our idigi cloud based platform and million for professional services and contract labor 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or  compared to million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increases of million for compensation related expenses mostly related to a full reinstatement of our non sales incentive program and million related to a litigation settlement discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
this partially was offset by a reduction of million in professional fees related to internal investigation and remediation actions we took related to the us foreign corrupt practices act incurred in fiscal restructuring expenses were million in fiscal  and increase of million  compared to a net reversal of restructuring expenses of million in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million related to the breisach  germany restructuring announced on july  in fiscal we reversed million of restructuring expenses related to the closing of an engineering facility in long beach  california  and the relocation and consolidation of the manufacturing facility in davis  california that was announced on april   which was partially offset by an additional charge relating to this restructuring of million for an additional six months of continued medical benefits as a result of new health care legislation passed in december other expense income  net compared to total other income  net was minimal in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
this decrease was mostly due to a reduction of million in foreign currency net transaction losses in fiscal as compared to fiscal also during fiscal we recorded a gain on the sale of an investment of million and recorded an additional million in interest income 
our average investment balance increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but our interest income remained the same as the prior fiscal year since we earned an average interest rate of in both fiscal and fiscal compared to other expense income  net was million of expense in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million of income in fiscal the majority of this was due to million of foreign currency net transaction losses in fiscal compared to foreign currency net transaction gains of million in fiscal we realized interest income on marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our average investment balance increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but our interest income was less than in the prior fiscal year since we earned an average interest rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and related statutory tax rate in each jurisdiction  and discrete events  such as settlements of audits 
during fiscal  we recorded a discrete tax benefit of million  related to additional research and development tax credits identified for fiscal years ended september   and  reversal of tax reserves for closure of various jurisdictions tax matters and tax rate reductions in foreign jurisdictions 
these discrete tax benefits reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points for the twelve month period ended september  to 
during fiscal  the income tax provision before discrete tax benefits was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to an increase in certain reserves for unrecognized tax benefits  an adjustment for foreign income taxed at the us rate  and a reduction in domestic tax benefits 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to a year ago 
during fiscal  we recorded a discrete tax benefit of million 
this benefit primarily resulted from the reversal of tax reserves from various jurisdictions  primarily foreign  related to the expiration of the statutes of limitations 
it also resulted from the enactment of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of extending the research and development tax credit that allowed us to record tax credits earned during the last three quarters of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal this benefit reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points for the twelve month period ended september  to 
during fiscal  we reversed million in income tax reserves associated primarily with the closing of prior tax years through statute expiration and the conclusion of a federal tax audit 
while the statutes of limitations have not expired  us federal income tax returns for the periods ended september  and september  have been audited by and settled with the internal revenue service 
the aforementioned income tax benefits resulting from the reversal of income tax reserves and other discrete tax benefits reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points in fiscal inflation management believes that during fiscal years  and  inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our consolidated financial position 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations principally with funds generated from operations 
we held cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million  million and million at september   and  respectively 
our working capital was million  million and million at september   and  respectively 
absent a disruption in our business  we expect our working capital to continue to increase 
consolidated statements of cash flows highlights year ended september  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  a net decrease of million 
this net decrease is due to the following a decrease in net income of million  deferred income tax benefit of million  depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in net working capital of million 
this was partially offset by net increases related to restructuring of million and other non cash items of million 
changes in working capital decreased cash flows primarily due to decreases of million for accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase of million related to income taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a net increase of million 
this net increase was due to an increase in net income of million  deferred income taxes of million  inventory obsolescence of million  net increases in working capital of million and other non cash items of million 
this was offset by net decreases in amortization expense of million 
changes in working capital increased cash flows by million due to a million increase in accounts receivable as the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal was less than the increase in fiscal and a million increase in inventories as inventories have declined in fiscal this was offset by a million net decrease in accounts payable and million in other assets and accrued expenses 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our net purchases of marketable securities were million less in fiscal as compared to fiscal we spent million for the final deferred payment related to the spectrum acquisition in fiscal this was partially offset by a decrease of million related to additional purchases of capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a net increase of million 
we used an additional million of cash for net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by million fewer capital expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared million in fiscal  a net decrease of million  resulting primarily from fewer exercises of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  resulting from additional exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
we expect positive cash flows from operations and believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  cash generated from operations and our ability to secure debt and or equity financing will be sufficient to fund our business operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months and beyond 
on july  our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
this repurchase authorization expires on september  at september   our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million this balance includes approximately million of cash and cash equivalents held by our controlled foreign subsidiaries of which million represents accumulated undistributed foreign earnings 
although we have no current need to do so  if we change our unremitted assertion to repatriate additional undistributed foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states  we would have to accrue applicable taxes 
the amount of any taxes and the application of any tax credits would be determined based on the income tax laws at the time of such repatriation 
under current tax laws  we estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability to be in the range of million to million and could have a material impact on our current consolidated balance sheet  results of operations and cash flows 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september  payments due by fiscal period in thousands total less than year years years thereafter operating leases the operating lease agreements included above primarily relate to office space 
the table above does not include possible payments for uncertain tax positions 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of september  due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of future cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
the above table also does not include those obligations for royalties under a license agreement as these royalties are calculated based on future sales of licensed products identified in the settlement agreement and we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount of cash payments 
foreign currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros  british pounds  japanese yen and indian rupees and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
we have not implemented a formal hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk 
during  we had approximately million of net sales related to foreign customers including export sales  of which million was denominated in foreign currency  predominantly the euro and british pound 
during both and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of net sales to foreign customers including export sales  of which million and million  respectively  were denominated in foreign currency  predominantly the euro and british pound 
in future periods  we expect a significant portion of sales will continue to be made in euros and british pounds 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recent accounting developments in august  the us securities and exchange commission the sec adopted a rule mandated by the dodd frank act to require companies to publicly disclose their use of conflict minerals that originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country 
the final rule applies to a company that uses minerals including tantalum  tin  gold or tungsten 
the final rule requires companies to provide disclosure on a new form filed with the sec  with the first specialized disclosure report due on may   for the calendar year  and annually on may each year thereafter 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the fasb amended its guidance on testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
under the amended guidance  companies may perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary  similar to the amended goodwill impairment testing guidance noted below 
the guidance for indefinite lived intangible assets is effective for annual and interim tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with an option for early adoption 
we will adopt asu effective for our fiscal year beginning october  and do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this guidance provides an update on how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
this revised guidance allows companies an option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment 
under the revised guidance  a company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill impairment exists prior to performing analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if  based on the qualitative assessment  a company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then quantitative testing for impairment is not necessary 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we  however  adopted this update early so it was effective for our fiscal year beginning october  see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
rather it requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance also requires us to present on the face of the financial statements any reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we will adopt this guidance beginning with our fiscal quarter ending december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  as it will only impact how certain information related to other comprehensive income is presented in our consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued asu no 
which amends this guidance and defers only the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated comprehensive income 
no other requirements of asu no 
are affected by this deferral 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this guidance updates many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance beginning with our fiscal quarter ending march  this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of embedded and non embedded hardware products to our distributors and direct oem customers  and to a small extent from the sale of professional and engineering services  fees associated with technical support  training  software licenses and royalties 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and there are no post delivery obligations other than warranty 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally is recognized upon shipment of product to customers  including direct oem and distributors 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and direct oems are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by us based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price adjustments as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price adjustments are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the reserve for future returns and pricing adjustments was million at september  and million at september our non product revenue represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of the non product revenue was from professional and engineering services and represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also had revenue from cloud based services  post contract customer support  fees associated with technical support  training  royalties and the sale of software licenses 
our software development tools and development boards often include multiple elements  including hardware  software licenses  post contract customer support  limited training and basic hardware design review 
our customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
revenue for professional and engineering services and training is recognized upon performance 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when earned 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its vendor specific objective evidence  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 
revenue from cloud based services is earned in two ways 
first  web based management fees are considered to be earned on a monthly basis consistent with a monthly contractual commitment 
second  transaction fees that are billed to the customer at the larger of the minimum price or the number of transactions times the stated fee and are considered earned as the transactions occur 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our marketable securities 
when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider several factors 
these factors include how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class  the performance of the issuer s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry  expected market volatility  analyst recommendations  the views of external investment managers  any news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the issuer operates 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these securities has occurred and is other than temporary  we would record a charge to other income expense 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued circumstances regarding collectability of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at both september  and september  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
once the new cost basis is established  the value is not increased with any changes in circumstances that would indicate an increase in value after the remeasurement 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for the net realizable value of inventories 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of june  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
as of june   our market capitalization was million compared to our carrying value of million 
our market capitalization plus our estimated control premium of resulted in a fair value in excess of our carrying value by a margin of and therefore no impairment was indicated 
at september   our market capitalization was million compared to our carrying value of million 
since there were no triggering events through september   and our market capitalization plus our estimated control premium of resulted in a fair value in excess of our carrying value by a margin of  no impairment was indicated 
the control premium used in our annual goodwill assessment at june  and our further evaluation of goodwill at september  was based on a recent control premium study as of june   resulting in a range of control premium of to

income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the us and outside of the us accordingly  we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
this determination requires us to make several estimates and assumptions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income  and other complex issues  may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in adjustments to our income tax balances that are material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations and could affect our cash flows for potential cash outflows 
we have unrecognized tax benefits of million classified as a long term liability 
we expect that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease approximately between million to million over the next months due to the expiration of statue of limitations 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect our effective tax rate is million 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
warranties in general  we warrant our products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service 
the warranty periods generally range from one to five years 
we typically have the option to repair or replace products we deem defective due to material or workmanship 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the period that the related revenue is recognized based upon an estimated average per unit repair or replacement cost applied to the estimated number of units under warranty 
these estimates are based upon historical warranty incidents and are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure the adequacy of the warranty accrual 
the product warranty accrual was million and million at september  and september   respectively
