item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note regarding forward looking statements the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended december  the md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes which appear elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed elsewhere in this form k  particularly in item a 
risk factors and in special note regarding forward looking statements inside the front cover of this form k 
overview and outlook dover delivered a record year in in terms of revenue  earnings  and bookings 
our consolidated revenue increased billion  or  to billion  inclusive of acquisitions  while our bookings grew by billion  or  to billion  and our gross profit grew by million  or  to billion 
however  our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased basis points to mainly due to product and customer mix as well as the impact of recent acquisitions  which more than offset operating leverage 
earnings from continuing operations increased to million 
in addition to our strong financial results  we accomplished several important strategic initiatives in we realigned our businesses into four new segments to more closely match our key end markets 
this new structure will serve to support our growth strategies and productivity initiatives as we continue to build our company 
during  we deployed billion on nine acquisitions that added technology  opened new markets  and expanded geography in nearly all of our growth spaces 
we also divested three businesses consistent with our strategy of focusing on our higher margin growth spaces 
we received proceeds in excess of million which we intend to utilize on future acquisitions or internal investments 
lastly  we generated million in free cash flow  which enabled us to aggressively invest in higher growth economies and innovation  and to continue our long tradition of raising our annual dividend  now standing at consecutive years 
as we concluded the fourth quarter  we encountered certain challenges  such as continued weakness in alternative energy  semi conductor and telecom infrastructure markets and general softness within the european economy  including uncertainty around european credit markets  that may continue to impact our operations going into despite these challenges  given our strong financial position and the depth and resilience of our business mix  we believe that through continued execution of our strategies around positioning ourselves to capitalize on global growth trends  capturing the benefits of common ownership and disciplined capital allocation  we are well positioned for solid growth in we expect full year organic growth to be in the range of to and acquisition related growth to be approximately for acquisitions completed in based on these revenue assumptions and profitability expectations  we expect our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for will be in the range of to and expect our earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters 

table of contents consolidated results of operations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  we are reporting three businesses that were sold during the third and fourth quarters of as discontinued operations 
therefore  we have classified the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented

the majority of our organic growth was attributed to increased volumes across all four segments driven by strength in the energy and consumer handset markets and solid growth in fluid solutions  refrigeration equipment and many of the industrial markets served by our engineered systems segment 
additionally  approximately of our growth was generated by new products  particularly in our communication technologies and printing identification segments 
pricing added about to revenue principally driven by strategic pricing initiatives and price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs 
revenues generated outside of the us increased by compared with  with revenue generated in emerging economies of china and latin america increasing 
over of the revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by harbison fischer and sound solutions  two large acquisitions that we made in to expand our operations serving the artificial lift and handset markets  respectively 
our consolidated revenue increased billion or compared with  reflecting organic revenue growth of  growth from acquisitions of  and a negligible unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation 
the organic growth reflected volume increases across all four of our segments  driven by higher demand in the majority of our end markets as the global economy continued to rebound in from the down cycle 
revenues generated outside of the us increased by compared with  with much of this growth generated in emerging economies of asia and latin america 
gross profit our gross profit increased million or in compared with  reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes 
however  gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted basis points in to from in due principally to the impact of product and customer mix  which more than offset operating leverage  as well as the impact of higher depreciation from recent acquisitions 
gross profit increased million or in compared with  reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes 
gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue was in  a basis point improvement over the gross profit margin of  reflecting the increase in sales volumes in  the impact of lower restructuring charges on a comparative basis  and benefits realized from restructuring initiatives executed in along with our productivity initiatives 

table of contents selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million or in compared with due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes 
as a percentage of revenue  selling and administrative expenses declined to in compared with in this basis point improvement is largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels  which more than offset higher amortization and other nonrecurring expenses related to recent acquisitions 
selling and administrative expenses increased million or in compared with due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes 
as a percentage of revenue  selling and administrative expenses declined to in compared with in this basis point improvement reflects the absence of significant restructuring charges in and the benefits realized from restructuring efforts  as well as leverage from the higher revenue levels partially offset by increased compensation costs 
non operating items interest expense  net  increased to million in due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings during as compared with as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  in february of we issued million in new notes  receiving net proceeds of million  approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire million of notes which came due earlier that month  with the remainder used to fund first quarter acquisitions 
as a result  our total borrowings were million higher at the end of compared to the end of in  interest expense  net  increased to million  primarily due to reduced interest income in resulting from lower interest rates on the company s short term investment balances 
other non operating expense income  net of million in includes million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  offset by royalty income and other miscellaneous non operating gains  none of which are individually significant 
other non operating expense  net of million in reflects million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  coupled with a million loss on extinguishment of debt  offset in part by royalty income and other miscellaneous non operating gains 
this compares to other non operating income  net of million in  which reflects million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  which was more than offset by a favorable insurance settlement and other miscellaneous non operating gains 
income taxes the effective tax rate on continuing operations was compared to the rate of 
the effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable discrete and other items in both years primarily driven by favorable audit settlements for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions relating to prior periods 
the effective rate for was favorably impacted by net discrete items totaling million  principally arising from settlements with the us federal taxing authority and state taxing authorities 
the effective tax rate for was favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling million  arising principally from settlements with the us federal taxing authority  coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter 
the effective tax rate of in was favorably impacted by million of net benefits recognized for discrete items 
excluding these discrete and other items a non gaap measure  the effective tax rate was in  in  and in  reflecting the geographic mix of earnings  with the earnings generated in foreign markets typically taxed at lower rates than in the us while we believe additional uncertain tax positions will be settled within the next twelve months  an estimate cannot be made due to the uncertainties associated with the resolution of these matters 

table of contents net earnings net earnings from continuing operations was million in  an increase of compared to due mainly to the earnings on increased revenue and a lower effective tax rate 
net earnings from continuing operations were million in  an increase of compared to  mainly due to increased revenues  operating margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate 
net earnings from discontinued operations increased to million in  primarily reflecting income of million from the operations of the three businesses sold this year and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities  offset in part by a net loss on the sale of these businesses of million  inclusive of goodwill impairment 
in  our net earnings from discontinued operations of million includes income of million from the operations of the businesses sold in and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities  offset in part by a net loss of approximately million related to the sale of a business that had been reflected as a discontinued operation in a previous year 
the net loss from discontinued operations of million includes a net loss on sale of million  mainly related to a write down of a business held for sale  coupled with other net losses from operations totaling million

diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in increased to and diluted net earnings per share increased to  as a result of the same factors discussed above 
restructuring activity we periodically undertake restructuring programs in response to prevailing business requirements and market conditions 
in addition to these factors  earnings across all segments were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges  while and earnings reflect the benefits captured from the businesses restructuring and integration programs initiated in and in late  we launched various synergy capture programs and restructuring initiatives in response to the weakening global economic environment at the time 
in and  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  relating to these programs 
these programs were largely executed throughout  and we realized incremental savings of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
during  we had a net reduction in our workforce of approximately  or  and a net reduction of manufacturing and warehouse facilities  as a result of these strategic restructuring efforts 
by  we had completed the majority of the initiatives launched in and in and  our businesses were generally expanding their operations  so our restructuring activities were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations 
we incurred restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  relating to such activities 
we do not currently anticipate significant restructuring activity in  but will continue to monitor business activity across our end markets and adjust capacity as necessary depending on the economic climate and other internal business factors 

table of contents segment results of operations as discussed previously  in the fourth quarter of we reorganized our businesses into four new segments to better align with our key end markets 
as such  the information herein has been recast to conform to the new segment structure for all periods presented

organic growth acquisitions foreign currency translation versus revenue generated by our communication technologies segment increased million  or  compared with  with million  or of the growth  attributed principally to the acquisition of sound solutions  which supplements our product offerings in the growing handset market 
although there was an incremental decrease in revenue due to normal pricing concessions for our communication and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities  this decrease was more than offset by revenue growth from market share gains  new product introductions and product mix 
our organic revenue growth of was largely due to continued strong demand for smart phones serving the communications market which grew significantly year over year 
our revenue in the communications market representing of segment revenue increased million  or  excluding sound solutions 
our microelectronic mechanical mems microphones and sisonic technologies were well positioned to capitalize on this market s growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands 
we also experienced solid demand in the commercial aerospace market due to increased build rates of commercial aircraft by leading aircraft manufactures and increased demand for our aftermarket products globally 
our aerospace industrial revenue of segment revenue increased million  or 
this overall growth was partially offset by weakened demand in the global telecom markets  driven in part by deferred industry investment due to service provider consolidation 
this contributed to a decrease of million  or  in our telecommunication other revenue of segment revenue 
revenue derived from our defense market of segment revenue declined million  or  mainly due to timing and funding of certain programs 
our life sciences revenue of segment revenue also declined by million  or  principally due to softer hearing aid demand in the first half of and overall softer medical equipment demand 
communication technologies earnings increased compared with  but operating margin declined basis points 
the margin decline mainly resulted from higher acquisition related costs including incremental depreciation and amortization  higher raw material costs  and lower margins from the integration of the sound solutions acquisition 
excluding the impact of sound solutions  earnings would have increased by million  or  and operating margin would have increased by basis points as compared with bookings and backlog at the end of indicate continued strength in the handset and aerospace markets as we head into  offset by continued softness in the telecommunication market 
versus communication technologies revenue and earnings increased and  respectively  compared with the increase in revenues was supported by organic revenue growth of and growth from acquisitions of  offset by a negligible impact from foreign currency translation 
the organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong demand for mems microphones  hearing aid components and telecom infrastructure related products 
earnings and operating margin in were favorably impacted by higher sales volume and production leverage  coupled with the absence of significant restructuring charges in and the benefit of restructuring programs

organic growth acquisitions foreign currency translation versus our energy segment posted record organic revenue  earnings and bookings in revenue and earnings were up and  respectively  due to continued strength in the drilling  production and downstream energy markets served by the segment 
recent acquisitions generated revenue growth of and contributed to the segment s record results 
sales outside of north america grew driven by significantly higher sales to central and south america  the middle east and russia 
pricing actions  generally undertaken to offset commodity inflation  accounted for a marginal portion of the revenue increase 
production sector revenue representing of segment revenue increased  with due to organic growth and from acquisitions 
the organic growth was driven by higher drilling and well completion activity  increased international sales  and higher demand for winch products serving the energy  infrastructure and recovery markets 
drilling sector revenue of segment revenue grew due to increased exploration activity  pricing  and market share increases 
our revenues in the drilling and production sectors are impacted by changes in the number of active north american drilling rigs 
the average north american drilling rig count in was up over the prior year  driven by strong oil prices 
downstream sector revenue of segment revenue was up  with from organic revenue growth and the balance from recent acquisitions 
the organic growth reflects continued strong demand for products in the power generation  rail  cargo tank and chemical industrial markets  as well as nozzles and hanging hardware for retail fueling stations 
energy earnings increased million  or  from the higher organic and acquisition volumes 
energy operating margin declined basis points compared to the prior year  due to the impact of acquisition related costs  including higher depreciation and amortization  and higher material costs  partially offset by improved operating leverage associated with the higher volumes  strategic pricing and productivity gains 
both bookings and backlog at the end of december increased significantly compared to the prior year  and we expect market conditions in to continue to be favorable for the energy segment 
the market compression of natural gas prices should not have a significant impact to our operations  as we expect the effects of the migration away from dry gas to be offset by increased oil and liquid rich gas activity 
versus our energy segment s revenue and earnings increased and  respectively  compared with organic revenue growth of was driven by a significant increase in active north american drilling rigs and market share gains in our drilling sector businesses 
increased drilling activity also favorably impacted our businesses in the production sector  particularly demand for sucker rods 
the average north american drilling rig count in was up compared to the inpro seal acquisition contributed revenue growth of approximately  and foreign currency translation favorably impacted revenue by 
the increase in earnings is the result of higher sales volume and benefits from productivity improvements and restructuring initiatives

revenue of our refrigeration industrial platform  which serves our refrigeration and food equipment  waste and recycling  and other industrial end markets  increased million  or 
revenue from refrigeration and food equipment representing of segment revenue increased million  or  reflecting strong demand for refrigeration systems fueled by remodel activity at major retail chains 
performance by our businesses serving the waste and recycling and other industrial markets of segment revenue was driven by increased global demand for industrial automation machinery  improving demand for vehicle services in the important asian markets and a market rebound in hydraulic equipment due in part to strength in the mining sector  partially offset by a double digit decline in waste and recycling revenue given continued constraints on municipal spending 
these factors combined to increase other industrial revenue by million  or 
revenue of our fluid solutions platform of segment revenue increased by million  or  reflecting strong demand for pumps in the chemical  transport and hygienic markets and increasing demand for heat exchange systems  coupled with the benefits from geographic expansion  particularly in asia  and price increases necessary to cover rising commodity costs 
engineered systems segment earnings increased million  or  on the strength of increased volume 
operating margin expanded by basis points  as a result of positive pricing actions and productivity savings  which more than offset cost escalation and unfavorable product mix 
bookings and backlog at the end of have increased compared to levels  driven by higher refrigeration  pump and heat exchange orders 
we continue to invest in market leading technologies to better serve the refrigeration market  as we expect more economies to propose and pass carbon limiting legislation in the coming years 
an example of this is our fourth quarter acquisition of advansor a s  which manufactures energy efficient transcritical co systems used in refrigeration systems 
versus our engineered systems revenue and earnings increased by and  respectively  as compared with organic revenue growth of was driven by higher sales volumes in refrigeration systems and vehicle service offerings  offset in part by softness in waste and recycling markets 
earnings and margin were favorably impacted by increased volumes in high margin businesses  the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits associated with restructuring initiatives

organic growth acquisitions foreign currency translation versus our printing identification segment s revenue increased compared with  with of the increase attributed to higher organic and new product volumes and from favorable foreign currency impacts 
price was slightly favorable  offsetting commodity inflation 
electronics revenue representing of segment revenue was up versus the prior year  with strong first half growth of driven by strong demand in the alternative energy and semiconductor markets  partially offset by a revenue decline in the second half of as demand weakened in these same electronic markets 
additionally  we realized volume growth in our fast moving consumer goods fmcg of segment revenue and industrial products of segment revenue  with combined revenue growth year over year  driven by successful new product introductions that gained traction as the year progressed 
printing identification earnings declined million in  resulting in an operating margin decline of basis points 
the margin decline is primarily attributed to the second half reduction in alternative energy and semiconductor revenues which are typically higher margin activity  coupled with unfavorable regional mix due to weaker european markets for our fmcg  and key strategic investments for growth directed toward our fmcg  industrial and electronics end markets 
we expect these investments to continue into as we consider these end markets integral to our longer term revenue growth focus 
we also completed several small employee reduction in force programs across targeted businesses to streamline operations and to align more closely with our growth in geographic end markets 
costs related to these programs were not significant 
year end bookings and backlog levels are down from the prior year  primarily due to the slowdown in electronics end markets  particularly alternative energy and semiconductor 
we currently expect these market conditions to continue through the first half of versus our printing identification segment s revenue increased by compared with  substantially driven by increased demand in all of its major product categories  including marking and coding and electronic assembly and board test equipment 
demand was fueled by the economic recovery  increased semiconductor handling business  and growth in solar alternative energy products 
earnings in increased over compared with primarily due to the favorable impact of product and geographic mix  the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits of restructuring initiatives 

table of contents financial condition we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dispositions  dividends  repurchases of outstanding shares  adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position  with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions  while managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 
cash flow summary the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows years ended ended december  cash flows from continuing operations in thousands net cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities in increased million  primarily due to increased net earnings in and reduced investment in working capital relative to higher sales volume increased net earnings before depreciation and amortization by million as compared with our investment in working capital was million lower than in  at which time a working capital build up was necessary to support revenue levels recovering from the declines 
these increases in cash flow were partially offset by million of higher income tax payments resulting from our higher earnings and tax settlement activity  as well as higher employee incentive compensation payments and reductions in deferred revenue 
cash provided by operating activities in increased million from higher sales volume increased net earnings before depreciation and amortization by million as compared with this was offset by a million increase in working capital necessary to support the increase in order and revenue levels  compared to a million decrease in working capital in the period when sales levels had declined 
other factors contributing to the increase in operating cash flows included million less in restructuring payments  million less of post retirement plan contributions  and a million increase in deferred revenue due to additional sales activity in the period 
postretirement costs relating to pension and other employee related defined benefit plans affect results in all segments 
we recorded net periodic benefit cost of million  million and million in  and  respectively  relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit  supplemental and post retirement plans 
the main drivers of expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long term estimates  including expected returns on plan assets  the service cost and the interest cost 
in  the actual return on us plan assets increased  while returns on our non us plan assets declined  as a result of the different mix of investments in the plans 
in  the actual return on plan assets increased  consistent with increased returns within the global equity markets 
in  we expect our net periodic benefit cost to be approximately million  with the increase compared to being attributed to higher amortization relating to unrecognized losses 
the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion  subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit plans reflected underfunding by million  which includes million relating to the us dover corporate pension plan and million relating to our significant international pension plans  some in locations where it is not economically advantageous to pre fund the plans due to local regulations 
the majority of the international obligations relate to defined pension plans operated by our businesses in germany  the united kingdom and switzerland 
cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in  we expect to contribute to million to our qualified defined benefit plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion regarding our post retirement plans 
adjusted working capital in  adjusted working capital a non gaap measure calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable increased from by million  or  to billion  which reflected an increase in receivables of million  an increase in net inventory of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  generally due to additional working capital investment necessary to support the increased revenue levels and the impact of acquisitions 
excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of million  adjusted working capital would have increased by million  or 

table of contents investing activities we used cash for investing activities of billion in and million in  mainly for capital spending and acquisitions  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of businesses 
in  our use of cash for investing activities also included a net payment of million on the settlement of foreign exchange forward contracts which had served as hedges of a portion of our euro denominated net investment 
acquisitions 
in  we used cash of billion to acquire nine businesses  including million for harbison fischer in the first quarter and million for sound solutions in the third quarter 
in comparison  we used million to acquire six businesses in capital spending 
capital expenditures  primarily to support capacity expansion  innovation and cost savings  were million in and million in the increase in capital spending reflects investment in capacity expansion within our businesses principally serving the high growth energy drilling and handset markets 
in  our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue were approximately 
we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue in to increase slightly  driven by capacity expansion to support our high growth  high demand energy and handset markets 
proceeds from sales of businesses 
we generated cash of million in  primarily from the sale of paladin brands  crenlo and heil trailer international  three businesses that had operated in our engineered systems segment 
this compares to net proceeds of million generated by the sale of triton in short term investments 
we typically invest cash in excess of near term requirements in short term investments 
in  we generated net proceeds of million from the sale of short term investments  which were used to fund a portion of the sound solutions acquisition 
in  our short term investment activity generated net proceeds of million 
we anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make in will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds  and if necessary  through the issuance of commercial paper or through public debt markets 
financing activities we used cash for financing activities of million in and million in  mainly for purchase of our common stock and payment of dividends  largely offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options 
long term and short term debt 
in  we realized net proceeds of million from the year notes due and year notes due issued in february  approximately half of which was used to repay million of other borrowings  principally commercial paper used to repay the year notes which came due earlier in february and to fund acquisitions made in the first quarter 
treasury purchases 
we historically repurchase shares of our common stock in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements  and expect to continue with this policy 
we used million for share repurchases in compared with million in during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market  pursuant to the  share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in may in  we purchased approximately million shares under the same program 
approximately million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this  five year authorization as of december  dividend payments 
total dividend payments to common shareholders were million in and million in our dividends per common share increased to per share in compared to per share in this represents the th consecutive year that our dividend has increased 
proceeds from exercise of stock options 
we received million from employee exercises of stock options in  compared to million in since  we have issued only stock settled appreciation rights sars  and a greater portion of our exercise activity was related to sars which do not require cash settlement 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources free cash flow in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating  investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure free cash flow a non gaap measure 
we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt  pay dividends  fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock 
for further information  see the non gaap disclosures at the end of this item the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities years ended ended december  free cash flow dollars in thousands cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for  we generated free cash flow of million  representing of revenue and of earnings from continuing operations  while continuing to make investments necessary to support our growth 
free cash flow in was million or of revenue  compared to million or of revenue in the full year increase in free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower investment in working capital  partially offset by higher tax payments in in  we made tax payments of approximately million compared to million in the prior year  with the increase resulting from the higher level of earnings  the timing of estimated payments  and the impact of certain changes in federal tax regulations 
free cash flow is also impacted by higher capital expenditures in necessary to fund expansion in our high growth businesses 
we expect to generate free cash flow in of approximately of revenue  consistent with our historical performance 
the increase in free cash flow compared to reflects higher earnings from continuing operations offset by investment in working capital and an increase in capital expenditures 
the basis point decline in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was the result of the significant reduction in working capital realized in coupled with lower revenue levels 
net debt to net capitalization we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a non gaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures at december  net debt to net capitalization ratio dollars in thousands current maturities of long term debt commercial paper long term debt total debt less cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net debt add stockholders equity net capitalization net debt to net capitalization our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at december  primarily due to the use of cash and debt to fund acquisitions totaling billion during the year 
total borrowings increased by million during  primarily due to million net proceeds received from the year notes due and year notes due issued in february  approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire million of notes which came due earlier in february in  we also received cash proceeds of million  primarily from the sale of three businesses 

table of contents at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled billion  representing a decrease of million  as compared with the balance including short term investments 
cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less 
we regularly invest cash in excess of near term requirements in short term investments  which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months  up to twelve months 
we held no short term investments at december  at december   our total cash and cash equivalents included million held outside of the united states 
we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes  including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock 
in november of  we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks to replace our existing facility that was set to expire in november our new facility permits borrowings up to billion  which is consistent with the facility we replaced  and expires on november  this facility is used primarily as liquidity back up for our commercial paper program 
we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so 
if we were to draw down a loan  at our election  the loan would bear interest at a eurodollar or sterling rate based on libor  plus an applicable margin ranging from to subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by s p and moody s or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility 
under this facility  we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than to we were in compliance with this covenant and our other long term debt covenants at december  and had a coverage ratio of to we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec with remaining capacity of billion that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes  including repayment of existing indebtedness  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
at december   we have an outstanding floating to floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of million in exchange for chf million 
in february  we amended and restated the terms of the arrangement to extend its maturity date to october  this transaction continues to hedge a portion of our net investment in chf denominated operations 
the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and the effective portion of the change in fair value is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings 
the fair value at december  reflected a loss of million due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 
in january  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to purchase million for million  which were designated as hedging an equivalent amount of our euro denominated net investment 
the agreements qualified as net investment hedges with the changes in fair value being reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings 
these arrangements were settled on april   at which time we realized a loss of million  which is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment 
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash flow to debt and debt to capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 
our credit ratings  which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies  were as follows as of december  short term rating long term rating outlook moody s p a stable standard poor s a a stable fitch f a stable we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk based interest rates for the foreseeable future 
acquisition spending and or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt 
operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements  including acquisitions and capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of december   we had approximately million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions  which expire at various dates in through these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance  warranty and other performance obligations 
in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations  the probability of which we believe is remote 
we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets  including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental  health and safety  tax and employment matters 
we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

table of contents a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december  and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years other long term debt interest expense rental commitments purchase obligations capital leases supplemental post retirement benefits uncertain tax positions total obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent total long term debt  including current maturities 
amounts represent estimate of future interest payments on long term debt using the interest rates in effect at december  amounts represent estimated benefit payments under our supplemental and post retirement benefit plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also expect to contribute approximately to million to our qualified defined benefit plans in  which amount is not reflected in the above table 
due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions  we are unable to estimate the timing of the related payments  if any  that will be made subsequent to these amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts we report 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures  including information regarding contingencies  risk and our financial condition 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates 
we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied 
we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 
revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectability is reasonably assured  and d delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components  with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
service revenue represents less than of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed 
in limited cases  our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery  installation  testing  certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized 
we do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements 
inventory for the majority of our subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventory is stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by us to properly value inventory 
businesses within our communication technologies and printing identification segments tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 

table of contents we have significant tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
our assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or  when indicators of impairment exist  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate  or when a significant portion of a reporting unit is to be reclassified to discontinued operations  during the interim periods 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analyses ie an income approach which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability 
changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses 
we believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
no goodwill impairment was indicated by the testing of our identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of  and the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value by at least and  in most cases  significantly more 
if the fair value of each of the reporting units was decreased by  the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized 
the valuation of our pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
annually  we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns  economic trends and portfolio allocation 
our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams 
the plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year by year spot rates 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the weighted average discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit  supplemental and other post retirement obligations ranged from to  reduced from the rates  which ranged from to 
the reduced discount rates are reflective of the decline in global market interest rates over these periods 
a basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december  our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately million 
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated  using more likely than not criteria  for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves 
reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations  changes in tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates  and our future taxable income levels 
the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 
we have significant accruals and reserves related to the self insured portion of our risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  our experience and relevant industry data 
we review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience 
we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense 
the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues 
while we believe that the amount accrued to date is adequate  future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 
occasionally  we will establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation  in accordance with appropriate accounting principles 
these liabilities  for both severance and exit costs  require the use of estimates 
though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 

table of contents we will from time to time discontinue certain operations for various reasons 
estimates are used to adjust  if necessary  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  including goodwill  to their estimated fair market value 
these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale 
fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar type entities 
the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold 
changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates 
we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  restricted stock and performance share awards 
we use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of sars and stock options granted to employees 
the model requires that we estimate the expected life of the sar or option  expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data 
we use the monte carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also require us to estimate the volatility of our stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of our peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group 
for additional information related to the assumptions used  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
recently adopted accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  which amended existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we adopted the multiple element guidance of asu effective january  we do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements  so the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu which eliminates tangible products containing both software and non software components that operate together to deliver a product s functionality from the scope of then current generally accepted accounting principles for software 
we adopted asu on a prospective basis  effective january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this asu only requires a change in the format of the current presentation 
we adopted this guidance for our year end reporting  presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings 
in september  the fasb issued asu which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer s participation in multiemployer pension plans 
the standard is intended to provide more information about an employer s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates 
this guidance became effective for our fiscal year end reporting 
its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asu which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for us beginning on january  its adoption is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test for goodwill impairment 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  however  an entity can choose to early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the final standard  provided that the entity has not yet performed its annual impairment test or issued its financial statements 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents non gaap disclosures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we also disclose non gaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors 
free cash flow  net debt  total debt  net capitalization  the net debt to net capitalization ratio  adjusted working capital  earnings adjusted for non recurring items  effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items  revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities  debt or equity  earnings  revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with gaap  and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity 
net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ 
free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions  pay dividends  repay debt and repurchase our common stock 
reconciliations of free cash flow  total debt and net debt can be found above in this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers 
we believe that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called working capital  which is calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable  provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue 
we believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency  which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes  given the global nature of our businesses 
we believe that reporting organic or core revenue growth  which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions  provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the diverse nature of our businesses activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks  including those related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts  however  nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly rated  diversified counterparties 
interest rate exposure we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts 
we issue commercial paper  which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates  however  maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pre tax earnings 
we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long term and fixed rate in nature 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our long term debt by approximately million 
however  since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments before their maturities  the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 
foreign currency exposure we conduct business in various non us countries  primarily in canada  mexico  substantially all of the european countries  brazil  argentina  malaysia  china  india and other asian countries 
therefore  we have a significant volume of foreign currency exposures that result from our international sales  purchases  investments  borrowings and other international transactions 
changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect our financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non us operations 
we may  from time to time  for a specific exposure  enter into fair value hedges 
at december   we had one outstanding floating to floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of million in exchange for chf million  which matures on october  this transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in non us operations 
the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings  with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings 
the fair values at december  and reflected losses of million and million  respectively  due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 
certain individual operating subsidiaries that have foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and or cash flow hedging programs 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of non us operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change of or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the translation of our balance sheet or statement of earnings
