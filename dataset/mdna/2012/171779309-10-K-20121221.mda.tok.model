market opportunity and strategy we believe that a number of underlying drivers in the marketplace represent long term opportunities for our business  and we expect them to result in growing demand for next generation networking solutions in our target markets 
we believe that market trends  including the proliferation of smartphones  tablets and similar devices running mobile web applications  the prevalence of video applications  and the shift of enterprise and consumer applications to cloud based or virtualized network environments  are indicative of increasing use and dependence by consumers and enterprises upon a growing variety of high bandwidth applications and services 
we expect that these services will continue to add significant multiservice network traffic  requiring our customers to continue to invest in high capacity network infrastructures that are more robust  programmable and efficient 
these dynamics also continue to drive demand for convergence of network features  functions and layers 
our strategy to capitalize on these market dynamics  promote operational efficiency and drive profitable growth of our business includes the corporate initiatives set forth in the strategy subsection of the description of our business under item of part i of this annual report above 
global market conditions and competitive landscape we believe that the market opportunity described above  together with multiservice traffic growth  are driving a shift in network priorities and spending toward high capacity  next generation network architectures 
however  during fiscal our market experienced a challenging environment including declining growth rates in spending on in the markets addressed by our packet optical networking solutions 
we believe that this reflects the macroeconomic conditions and competitive landscape encountered in our market during the year 

table of contents the sustained period of macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and in capital markets has resulted in a high degree of uncertainty and cautious customer behavior in our industry and markets 
these dynamics  particularly in europe  have resulted and may continue to result in lower levels of capital expenditure on communications network infrastructure 
conditions in our markets have also resulted in protracted sales cycles  lengthier network deployments and revenue recognition delays 
broad macroeconomic weakness has previously resulted in periods of decreased demand for our products and services that have adversely affected our results of operations 
we remain uncertain as to how long current macroeconomic and industry conditions will persist and the magnitude of the effect of these conditions on the growth of our markets and business  as well as our results of operations 
we also continue to encounter a highly competitive marketplace  particularly within our packet optical transport segment  where we and our competitors have introduced new  high capacity  high speed network solutions and have aggressively sought to capture market share 
in this competitive environment  securing new opportunities  particularly in international markets  often requires that we agree to less favorable initial pricing  commercial terms that can elongate the revenue recognition cycle  startup costs to operationalize our solutions in customer networks  financial commitments or performance bonds that place cash resources at risk  and other onerous contractual commitments that place a disproportionate allocation of risk upon the vendor 
these terms can adversely affect our results of operations and contribute to fluctuations in our results 
we expect the competitive landscape to remain challenging and dynamic as we and our competitors introduce new  competing platforms  as networking technologies or features converge  and as competitors seek customer adoption of their network architectural approaches 
see the competition section of item  business  in part i of this annual report for more information regarding our competitive landscape 
we expect the level of competition to continue and potentially increase  particularly in north america  as chinese equipment vendors seek to gain entry into the us market  and other multinational competitors seek to retain incumbent positions with large customers in the region 
financial results for fourth quarter of fiscal revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  representing a sequential decrease of from million in the third quarter of fiscal revenue related details reflecting sequential changes from the third quarter of fiscal include product revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased by million  primarily reflecting a decrease in packet optical switching revenue of million and a decrease of million in packet optical transport revenue

fiscal compared to fiscal revenue the table below in thousands  except percentage data sets forth the changes in our operating segment revenue for the periods indicated 
table of contents fiscal year increase decrease revenue packet optical transport packet optical switching carrier ethernet solutions software and services consolidated revenue denotes of total revenue denotes change from to packet optical transport revenue increased reflecting a million increase in sales of our packet optical platform  largely driven by service provider demand for high capacity  optical transport for coherent g and g network infrastructures 
this increase was partially offset by sales decreases of million in our advanced services platform  million of advanced services platform  million in legacy transport products  million in multiservice optical platform and million of cpl 
this shift in revenue reflects changing market demand as network operators adopt coherent  high capacity network infrastructures  and our focused marketing and development investment on our next generation packet optical platform that leverages the convergence of packet and optical networking technologies to enable a scalable  programmable solution 
packet optical switching revenue decreased reflecting a million decrease in sales of our coredirector multiservice optical switches 
packet optical switching revenue has historically reflected sales of our coredirector platform  which has a concentrated customer base 
as a result  revenue and gross margin for this segment can fluctuate considerably depending upon individual customer purchasing decisions 
our packet optical switching segment is in the midst of a platform transition to our next generation reconfigurable switching system and the otn configuration for the reconfigurable switching system 
these platforms reflect market and customer demand for solutions that consolidate network features  such as otn switching and transport  that leverage the convergence of packet and optical networking technologies 
as a result  packet optical switching benefited from a million increase in sales of our reconfigurable switching system  primarily relating to the completion of an international  solutions based  submarine network deployment  and an million increase in sales of our otn configuration for the reconfigurable switching system 
carrier ethernet solutions revenue increased reflecting increases of million in sales of our and families of service delivery and aggregation switches and a million increase in sales of our service aggregation switch to support wireless backhaul  ethernet business services and residential broadband applications 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in sales of our legacy broadband products 
software and services revenue increased reflecting increases of million in network transformation consulting services  million in installation and deployment  million in maintenance and support services revenue and million in software sales 
revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states is reflected as international in the geographic distribution of revenue below 
the table below in thousands  except percentage data sets forth the changes in geographic distribution of revenue for the periods indicated fiscal year increase decrease united states international total 
table of contents denotes of total revenue denotes change from to united states revenue reflects increases of million in software and services revenue  million in packet optical transport sales and million in carrier ethernet solutions sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in packet optical switching sales 
international revenue reflects increases of million in software and services revenue  million in packet optical transport sales and million in packet optical switching sales 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease of million in carrier ethernet solutions sales 
a sizable portion of our revenue continues to come from sales to a small number of service providers 
as a result  our financial results are significantly affected by and can fluctuate depending upon spending levels and the business opportunities and challenges encountered by our service provider customers 
some of our customers have indicated a procurement strategy to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase equipment  which could further affect our concentration of revenue where we participate in these efforts 
sales to at t were million  or of total revenue  in fiscal and million  or of total revenue  in fiscal we did not have any other customers accounting for greater than of our revenue in fiscal or cost of goods sold and gross profit product cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  component costs  employee related costs and overhead  shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing related operations  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  amortization of intangible assets  cost of excess and obsolete inventory and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
services cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third party costs  including employee related costs  associated with our provision of services including installation  deployment  maintenance support  consulting and training activities  and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
our gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  is susceptible to fluctuations due to a number of factors 
in any given period  gross margin can vary significantly depending upon the mix and concentration of revenue by segment  product line within a particular segment  geography  and customers 
gross margin can also be affected by our concentration of lower margin commons equipment sales and higher margin channel cards  the mix of lower margin installation services within our service revenue  our introduction of new products  and changes in expense for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty obligations 
we expect that gross margins will be subject to fluctuation based on our level of success in driving product cost reductions  rationalizing our supply chain and consolidating third party contract manufacturers and distribution sites as part of our effort to optimize our operations 
gross margin can also be adversely affected by the level of pricing pressure and competition that we encounter in the market 
in an effort to retain or secure customers  enter new markets or capture market share  we may agree to pricing or other unfavorable commercial terms that result in lower or negative gross margins on a particular order or group of orders 
these market dynamics and factors may adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations in certain periods 
service gross margin can be affected by the mix of customers and services  particularly the mix between deployment and maintenance services  geographic mix and the timing and extent of any investments in internal resources to support this business

deferred revenue deferred revenue decreased by million during fiscal product deferred revenue represents payments received in advance of shipment and payments received in advance of our ability to recognize revenue 
services deferred revenue is related to payment for service contracts that will be recognized over the contract term 
the following table reflects in thousands the balance of deferred revenue and the change in this balance from the end of fiscal through the end of fiscal october  increase decrease products services total deferred revenue contractual obligations during fiscal  we entered into a lease relating to office space for our new corporate headquarters in hanover  maryland  consisting of a rentable area of approximately  square feet 
the future minimal rental commitments to be paid over the year lease term are approximately million 
the following is a summary of our future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of october  in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter interest due on convertible notes principal due at maturity on convertible notes operating leases capital lease other obligations purchase obligations total the amount for operating leases above does not include variable insurance  taxes  maintenance and other costs required by the applicable operating lease 
these costs are not expected to have a material future impact 
purchase obligations relate to purchase order commitments to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory 
in certain instances  we are permitted to cancel  reschedule or adjust these orders 
consequently  only a portion of the amount reported above relates to firm  non cancelable and unconditional obligations 
as of october   we also had approximately million of other long term obligations in our consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions that are not included in this table because the timing or amount of any cash settlement with the respective tax authority cannot be reasonably estimated 

table of contents some of our commercial commitments  including some of the future minimum payments in operating leases set forth above and certain commitments to customers  are secured by standby letters of credit collateralized under our credit facility or restricted cash 
restricted cash balances are included in other current assets or other long term assets depending upon the duration of the underlying letter of credit obligation 
use of restricted cash to support these standby letters of credit decreased significantly during fiscal as we utilized our credit facility to replace cash previously required to collateralize these obligations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report for a summary of the material terms and condition of the credit facility 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment expiration date as of october  in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter standby letters of credit off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any equity interests in so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities spes and structured finance entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  derivatives and hedging  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas where significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
customer purchase agreements and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery or services rendered 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
we apply the percentage of completion method to long term arrangements where we are required to undertake significant production  customizations or modification engineering  and reasonable and reliable estimates of revenue and cost are available 
utilizing the percentage of completion method  we recognize revenue based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred 
in instances that do not meet the percentage of completion method criteria  recognition of revenue is deferred until there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in instances where final acceptance criteria of the software is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

table of contents we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
accounting for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to fiscal arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of equipment  services and software 
if multiple element arrangements include software or software related elements that are essential to the equipment  we allocate the arrangement fee among separate units of accounting 
multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into more than one unit of accounting if the functionality of the delivered element s is not dependent on the undelivered element s  there is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element s  and general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered element s have been met 
the amount of product and services revenue recognized is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vsoe of fair value exists 
vsoe is established based on our standard pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vsoe for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for all other multiple element arrangements  we separate the elements into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element s  and delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially in our control 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each accounting unit or using the residual method if objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element s 
the revenue recognition criteria described above are applied to each separate unit of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been delivered 
accounting for multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified after fiscal in october  the financial accounting standards board  fasb amended the accounting standard for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables which provided guidance on how the arrangement fee should be allocated 
the amended guidance allows the use of management s best estimate of selling price besp for individual elements of an arrangement when vsoe or third party evidence tpe is unavailable 
additionally  it eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition in accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements 
the fasb also amended the accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with software elements to exclude from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
we adopted the new accounting guidance on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after november  under the new guidance  we separate elements into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially in our control 
therefore  the new guidance allows for deliverables  for which revenue was previously deferred due to an absence of fair value  to be separated and recognized as revenue as delivered 
also  because the residual method has been eliminated  discounts offered by us are allocated to all deliverables  rather than to the delivered element s 
our adoption of the new guidance for revenue arrangements changed the accounting for certain products that consist of hardware and software components  in which these components together provided the product s essential functionality 
for transactions involving these products entered into prior to fiscal  we recognized revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
revenue for multiple element arrangements is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each element  with revenue recognized when the revenue recognition criteria are met for each delivered element 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable based upon the selling price hierarchy for multiple deliverable arrangements 
under this hierarchy  we use vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable  we use our besp for that deliverable 
vsoe is established based on our standard pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  which exists across certain of our service offerings  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
we have generally been unable to establish tpe of selling price because our go to market strategy differs from that of others in our markets  and the extent of customization and differentiated features and functions varies among comparable products or services from our peers 
we determine besp based upon management approved pricing guidelines  which consider multiple factors including the type of product or service  gross margin objectives  competitive and market conditions  and the go to market strategy  all of which can affect pricing practices 

table of contents historically  for arrangements with multiple elements  we were typically able to establish fair value for undelivered elements and so we applied the residual method 
as a result  assuming the adoption of the accounting guidance above on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after november   the effect on revenue recognized for fiscal would have been an increase of approximately million 
our total deferred revenue for products was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and net intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill 
these assumptions and estimates include a market participant s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and  when appropriate  includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms 
our significant assumptions and estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
during fiscal  we completed the men acquisition for a purchase price of million 
as a result of the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as contingent consideration  there was no value assigned to goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial or other performance criteria or targets as a condition to the vesting  or acceleration of vesting 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the performance period  using graded vesting  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to share based compensation and the amount of share based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of october   total unrecognized compensation expense was million i million  which relates to unvested stock options and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of year  and ii million  which relates to unvested restricted stock units and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock units directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had 
table of contents recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law with and without method 
under the with and without method  the windfall is considered realized and recognized for financial statement purposes only when an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax benefits including our net operating losses 
the with and without method results in the windfall from share based compensation awards always being effectively the last tax benefit to be considered 
consequently  the windfall attributable to share based compensation will not be considered realized in instances where our net operating loss carryover that is unrelated to windfalls is sufficient to offset the current year s taxable income before considering the effects of current year windfalls 
reserve for inventory obsolescence we make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold 
upon recognition of the write down  a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
in an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer needs we purchase inventory based on forecasted sales across our product lines 
in addition  part of our research and development strategy is to promote the convergence of similar features and functionalities across our product lines 
each of these practices exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order products for which we have forecasted sales  or will purchase less than we have forecasted 
historically  we have experienced write downs due to changes in our strategic direction  discontinuance of a product and declines in market conditions 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the charges in fiscal were primarily related to excess inventory due to a change in forecasted sales across our product line 
the charges in fiscal were primarily related to engineering design changes and the discontinuance of certain parts and components used in the manufacture of our packet optical transport and packet optical switching products 
our inventory net of allowance for excess and obsolescence was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on management s assessment  on a specific identification basis  of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally have not required collateral or other forms of security from customers 
in determining the appropriate balance for our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  management considers each individual customer account receivable in order to determine collectibility 
in doing so  we consider creditworthiness  payment history  account activity and communication with such customer 
if a customer s financial condition changes  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to take a charge for an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
long lived assets our long lived assets include equipment  furniture and fixtures  finite lived intangible assets  and maintenance spares 
as of october  and october  these assets totaled million and million  net  respectively 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
our long lived assets are assigned to asset groups which represents the lowest level for which we identify cash flows 
due to the lack of a triggering event  no impairment analysis was performed in fiscal or deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   we have recorded a valuation allowance of billion which offsets nearly all our net deferred tax assets 
when measuring the need for a valuation allowance  we assess both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal 
because evidence such as our operating results during the most recent three year period is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  
table of contents our cumulative loss during this three year period represents sufficient negative evidence regarding the need for nearly a full valuation allowance 
we will release this valuation allowance when management determines that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
any future release of valuation allowance may be recorded as a tax benefit increasing net income or as an adjustment to paid in capital  based on tax ordering requirements 
warranty our liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to five years 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of goods sold based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
the provision for product warranties was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
the provision for warranty claims may fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of products and customers in that period 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
an increase in warranty claims or the related costs associated with satisfying these warranty obligations could increase our cost of sales and negatively affect our gross margin 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
unaudited quarterly results of operations the tables below in thousands  except per share data set forth the operating results in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  this information is unaudited  but in our opinion reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we currently hold an investment in a us government obligation that matures in january see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for information relating to investments and fair value 
this investment is sensitive to interest rate movements  and its fair value will decline as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates decline 
the estimated impact on this investment of a basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve from rates in effect as of the balance sheet date would be a million decline in value 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  our business and results of operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of our increased global presence  a larger percentage of our revenue is non us dollar denominated with canadian dollars and euros being our most significant foreign currency revenue streams 
if the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  our revenues reported in us dollars would decline 
for our us dollar denominated sales  an increase in the value of the us dollar would increase the real cost to our customers of our products in markets outside the united states  which could impact our competitive position 
with regard to operating expense  our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in canadian dollars  british pounds  euros and indian rupees 
during fiscal  approximately of our operating expense was non us dollar denominated 
if these currencies strengthen  costs reported in us dollars will increase  which would increase our expenses 
during fiscal  research and development expense benefited from approximately million  inclusive of hedging  due to the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the canadian dollar and the indian rupee in comparison to fiscal also in fiscal  sales and marketing expense benefited from approximately million due to the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the euro in comparison to fiscal from time to time  we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce part of the variability in certain forecasted non us dollar denominated cash flows 
generally  these derivatives are for maturities of months or less and are designated as cash flow hedges 
we consider several factors when evaluating hedges of our forecasted foreign currency exposures  such as significance of the exposure  offsetting economic exposures  potential costs of hedging  and the potential for hedge ineffectiveness 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for purposes other than hedging economic exposures 
during fiscal and  we entered into forward contracts to reduce the variability in our canadian dollar and indian rupee denominated operating expenses which principally relate to our research and development activities 
convertible debt outstanding 
the fair market value of each of our outstanding issues of convertible notes is subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the convertible feature of the notes and other factors 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes may also increase as the market price of our stock rises and decrease as the market price of the stock falls 
interest rate and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes  and may affect the prices at which we would be able to repurchase such notes were we to do so 
these changes do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
for additional information on the fair value of our outstanding notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report
