all figures presented below represent results from continuing operations  unless otherwise specified 
general we offer products and services ranging from portable power solutions to communications and electronics systems 
through our engineering and collaborative approach to problem solving  we serve government  defense and commercial customers across the globe 
we design  manufacture  install and maintain power and communications systems including rechargeable and non rechargeable batteries  communications and electronics systems and accessories  and custom engineered systems and solutions 
we sell our products worldwide through a variety of trade channels  including original equipment manufacturers oems  industrial and retail distributors  national retailers and directly to us and international defense departments 
we report our results in two operating segments battery energy products and communications systems 
the battery energy products segment includes lithium volt  cylindrical and various other non rechargeable batteries  in addition to rechargeable batteries  uninterruptable power supplies  charging systems and accessories  such as cables 
the communications systems segment includes power supplies  cable and connector assemblies  rf amplifiers  amplified speakers  equipment mounts  case equipment  integrated communication system kits and communications and electronics systems design 
on january   we began to report chargers in the battery energy products segment  to better align the portfolio of chargers with customers for those products and with how we manage our business operations 
previously  we had reported chargers in the communications systems segment 
we believe that reporting performance at the gross profit level is the best indicator of segment performance 
as such we report segment performance at the gross profit level and operating expenses as corporate charges 
we continually evaluate ways to grow  including opportunities to expand through mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures  which can broaden the scope of our products and services  expand operating and market opportunities and provide the ability to enter new lines of business synergistic with our portfolio of offerings 
on march   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of the tactical communications products business of science applications international corporation 
the tactical communications products business amti  located in virginia beach  virginia  designs  develops and manufactures 
table of contents tactical communications products including amplifiers  man portable systems  cables  power solutions and ancillary communications equipment 
the amti business is part of our communications systems operating segment 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement for amti  the purchase price consisted of  in cash 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on march   our senior management  as authorized by our board of directors  decided to exit our energy services business 
as a result of management s ongoing review of our business segments and products  and taking into account the lack of growth and profitability potential of the energy services segment as well as its sizeable operating losses over the last several years  we determined it was appropriate to refocus our operations on profitable growth opportunities presented in our other segments  battery energy products and communications systems 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to write off the goodwill and intangible assets and certain fixed assets associated with the standby power portion of our energy services business 
the actions taken to exit our energy services business resulted in the elimination of approximately jobs and the closing of five facilities  primarily in california  florida and texas 
we completed all exit activities with respect to our energy services segment by the end of the second quarter of  and have reclassified our energy services segment as a discontinued operation 
in connection with the exit activities described above  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately  the restructuring charges include approximately of employee related costs  including termination benefits  approximately of lease termination costs  approximately of inventory and fixed asset write downs and approximately  of other associated costs 
the cash component of the aggregate total restructuring charges was approximately  subsequent to the completion of our exit activities  adjustments have been made to estimates of certain reserves and accruals that existed at that time 
these adjustments amount to and were due to the difference in our actual experience compared to our expectations as of the completion of our exit activities 
on february   our senior management  as authorized by our board of directors  decided to divest our redblack communications business 
as a result of management s ongoing review of our business portfolio  management had determined that redblack offers limited opportunities to achieve the operating margin thresholds of our new business model and decided to refocus our operations on profitable growth opportunities presented in the other product lines that comprise our business segments  battery energy products and communication systems 
since  our redblack communications business has incurred significant operating losses 
revenues for our redblack communications business for the year ended december  were  and its contribution to gross profit was  we are seeking to sell our redblack subsidiary as a going concern and will be engaging appropriate professionals to assist in that effort 
we anticipate that the actions taken to divest the redblack communications business will result in the elimination of approximately jobs and the transfer of the redblack facility located in hollywood  maryland in connection with the divestiture 
we cannot predict at this time when the closing of any divestiture transaction will occur 
commencing with the first quarter of and concluding with the ultimate closing of the transaction  the results of redblack operations and related divestiture costs will be reported as a discontinued operation 
in  we implemented a series of lean initiatives throughout the entire organization 
lean is a disciplined management philosophy which is focused on using resources more effectively and the elimination of non value added functions to any process 
the expected result is a reduction in costs through becoming more efficient 
currently  we do not experience significant seasonal sales trends in any of our operating segments  although sales to the us defense department and other international defense organizations can be sporadic based on the needs of those particular customers 
overview consolidated revenues for the year ended december  decreased by  or  from the year ended december  this decrease was primarily caused by lower revenues in our communications systems segment in when compared to  as a result of significant deliveries that were part of the satcom systems order received in may also contributing to the decrease was a  charge recorded in the first quarter of to reflect the settlement with the us government related to exigent contracts completed between and gross margin decreased to for the year ended december   as opposed to for the year ended december  excluding the impact of the aforementioned  charge and a  non cash charge in the third quarter to write off components for legacy amplifiers that we had discontinued  gross margin for would have been

operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from reported in due to the impact of lower revenues in adjusted ebitda  defined as net income loss attributable to ultralife before net interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  plus minus expenses income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations  amounted to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  see the section adjusted ebitda beginning on page for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to ultralife 
as a result of careful working capital management and cash generated from operations and our lean initiatives  our liquidity remains solid with cash of  and no debt 
we had nothing outstanding on our revolver at the end of our inventory levels at the end of increased by  over year end  due to delays in the shipments of rechargeable batteries into january and building amplifier inventory to help fulfill our recently announced a amplifier system contract with a major international defense contractor 
outlook management expects year over year percentage revenue growth approaching double digits 
operating income growth is expected to outpace revenue growth and generate an operating margin of approximately to 
management cautions that the timing of orders and shipments may cause variability in quarterly results

communications systems revenues decreased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the decrease in communications systems revenues was mainly due to higher deliveries of satcom systems in driven by the completion of the contract for these vehicle mounted systems 
satcom systems shipments amounted to  in versus  in excluding sales of satcom systems in and  communications systems sales would have only decreased by  or  due to delays in the us government s funding approval for amplifier orders 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  correspondingly  consolidated gross margin was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the  charge recorded in the first quarter of to reflect the settlement with the us government related to exigent contracts completed between and and the  non cash charge in the third quarter of to write off components for legacy amplifiers that we had discontinued

research and development costs were  in  a decrease of or  over the  reported in selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  this decrease represents the results of our broad actions to reduce our overall spending base in non revenue producing functions 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  interest expense  net of interest income  decreased  from  for to for  mainly as a result of lower average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities during the course of miscellaneous income amounted to for compared with for the income in both and was primarily due to transactions impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
income taxes 
we reflected a tax provision of for the year ended december  compared with a tax benefit of for the same period of the tax benefit was principally a result of our realization of a current tax benefit related to our election in to carry back the net operating loss to the prior five tax years 
this amount was partially offset by state income taxes due for this election resulted in us receiving a refund of alternative minimum taxes paid in the prior five years 

table of contents the effective consolidated tax rate for the years ended december  and was september  september  years ended december  income loss before incomes taxes a total income tax provision benefit b effective tax rate b a in and  in the us and the us  we continue to report a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets that cannot be offset by reversing temporary differences 
this results from the conclusion that it is more likely than not that we would not utilize our us and uk nol s that had accumulated over time 
the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets resulted from our evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the assessment of the realizability of the nol s was based on a number of factors including  our history of net operating losses  the volatility of our earnings  our historical operating volatility  our historical inability to accurately forecast earnings for future periods and the continued uncertainty of the general business climate as of the end of we concluded that these factors represent sufficient negative evidence and have concluded that we should record a full valuation allowance under financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance on the accounting for income taxes 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in  we reported a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in china 
as a result of our assessment at december   there is no longer a need to record a valuation allowance for the chinese deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
we are more likely than not to fully utilize the nol in china and therefore have removed the valuation allowance during we continually assess the carrying value of this asset based on relevant accounting standards 
we have determined that a change in ownership  as defined under internal revenue code section  occurred in and as such  the domestic nol carryforward will be subject to an annual limitation estimated to be in the range of approximately  to  the unused portion of the annual limitation can be carried forward to subsequent periods 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards due to the successive ownership changes is currently limited to a minimum of approximately  annually  plus the carryover from unused portions of the annual limitations 
we believe such limitation will not impact our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain of our nol carryforwards are subject to us alternative minimum tax such that carryforwards can offset only of alternative minimum taxable income 
this limitation did not have an impact on income taxes determined for and for further discussion  see risk factors in item a of this annual report 
discontinued operations

total revenues for the twelve months ended december  amounted to  an increase of  or from the  reported for the twelve months ended december  battery energy products revenues decreased  or  from  for the twelve months ended december to  reported for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in battery energy products revenues was primarily attributable to higher demand for our rechargeable batteries  including automotive telematics batteries resulting from favorable economic conditions in the automotive industry  offset by lower battery sales to the us department of defense 
communications systems revenues increased  or  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  reported for the twelve months ended december  the increase in communications systems revenues was mainly due to deliveries on the satcom systems order we received in may and amplifier sales resulting from our acquisition of amti on march  and continued favorable demand for these products 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in revenues 
consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the year ended december  correspondingly  consolidated gross margin percentage was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december   primarily attributable to the margin improvements in the battery energy products and communications systems business segments

battery energy products gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of revenues both increased for the year ended december   primarily as a result of manufacturing efficiencies and higher selling prices and volumes realized for some of our products  in comparison to the year ended december  
table of contents in our communications systems segment  the cost of products sold increased  from  in to  in communications systems gross margin for was  or  an increase of  from s gross margin of  or 
the increase in both the gross margin and the gross margin percentage for communications systems resulted from deliveries under the satcom systems order we received in may and from our acquisition of the amti amplifier business in march and increased sales of its higher margin products 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from reported the prior year  due to across the board cost reduction and consolidation actions we commenced in the latter half of amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions was for in selling  general  and administrative expenses and in research and development costs  compared with for in selling  general  and administrative expenses and in research and development costs 
research and development costs were  in  a decrease of  or  over the  reported in  with the decrease due to the timing of development projects relating to both our business segments

see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we continually assess the carrying value of this asset based on relevant accounting standards 
we have determined that a change in ownership  as defined under internal revenue code section  occurred in and as such  the domestic nol carryforward will be subject to an annual limitation estimated to be in the range of approximately  to  the unused portion of the annual limitation can be carried forward to subsequent periods 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards due to the successive ownership changes is currently limited to a minimum of approximately  annually  plus the carryover from unused portions of the annual limitations 
we believe such limitation will not impact our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 

table of contents in addition  certain of our nol carryforwards are subject to us alternative minimum tax such that carryforwards can offset only of alternative minimum taxable income 
this limitation did not have an impact on income taxes determined for and discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  totaled  for the year ended december   compared to a loss of  in the same period of in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to write off the goodwill and intangible assets and certain fixed assets associated with the standby power portion of our energy services business 
for more information  see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
net income loss attributable to ultralife 
net loss attributable to ultralife and loss attributable to ultralife common shareholders per diluted share were  and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to net loss attributable to ultralife and earnings attributable to ultralife common shareholders per diluted share of  and  respectively  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
average common shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share increased from  in to  in  mainly due to the issuance of  shares of our common stock to the former principals of us energy pursuant to an amendment to our purchase agreement with them  stock option exercises and shares of common stock issued to our non employee directors 
adjusted ebitda in evaluating our business  we consider and use adjusted ebitda from continuing operations  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our operating performance 
we define adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as net income loss attributable to ultralife before net interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  plus minus expenses income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing continuing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance and to enhance comparability between periods 
we also believe the use of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in such items as capital structures affecting relative interest expense and stock based compensation expense  the book amortization of intangible assets affecting relative amortization expense  the age and book value of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense and other significant non operating expenses or income 
we also present adjusted ebitda from continuing operations because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance 
we reconcile adjusted ebitda from continuing operations to net income loss attributable to ultralife  the most comparable financial measure under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
we use adjusted ebitda from continuing operations in our decision making processes relating to the operation of our business together with us gaap financial measures such as income loss from operations 
we believe that adjusted ebitda from continuing operations permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our us gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and of non cash stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among companies 
we believe that by limiting adjusted ebitda to continuing operations  we assist investors in gaining a better understanding of our business on a going forward basis 
we provide information relating to our adjusted ebitda from continuing operations so that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our adjusted ebitda from continuing operations are a valuable indicator of our operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flows to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
the term adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is not defined under us gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap 
our adjusted ebitda from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  adjusted ebitda from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income loss attributable to ultralife or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with us gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to  the following adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  and all of the costs associated with operating our business  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  
table of contents while stock based compensation is a component of cost of products sold and operating expenses  the impact on our consolidated financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as assumed life of the stock based awards and assumed volatility of our common stock  although discontinued operations does not reflect our current business operations  discontinued operations does include the costs we incurred by exiting our energy services business  and other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda from continuing operations differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda from continuing operations only supplementally 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is calculated as follows for the periods presented september  september  september  years ended december  net income loss attributable to ultralife add interest expense  net add less income tax provision benefit add depreciation and amortization of financing fees add amortization of intangible assets add stock based compensation expense add less loss gain from discontinued operations  net of tax adjusted ebitda liquidity and capital resources cash flows and general business matters the following cash flow information is being presented net of continuing and discontinued operations 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of from the beginning of the year 
during the twelve months ended december   we generated  of cash from operating activities as compared to generating  of cash for the twelve months ended december  the cash from operating activities provided in was mainly attributable to our net loss of  plus an addback of  for non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and a loss from discontinued operations  net of tax of  approximately  of cash was generated from working capital due mainly to decreases in accounts receivable  due to timing of orders and a decrease in accounts payable  coupled with an increase in inventories 
for  the cash generated from operating activities of  was mainly attributable to a net loss of  plus an addback of  for non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and a loss from discontinued operations of  that included an impairment charge of goodwill and long lived assets of  approximately  of cash was used for working capital due mainly to a decrease in inventories  offset by increases in accounts receivable due to timing of orders and a decrease in accounts payable 
we used  in cash for investing activities during compared with  in cash used for investing activities in in  we spent  to purchase plant  property and equipment and was used in connection with the contingent purchase price payout related to rps power systems  inc rps 
in addition  we received in 
table of contents cash proceeds from dispositions of property  plant and equipment and relating to the reduction of the uk restricted cash 
in  we spent  to purchase plant  property and equipment  was used to establish a restricted cash fund in connection with our uk operations  and was used in connection with the contingent purchase price payout related to rps 
in addition  we received in cash proceeds from dispositions of property  plant and equipment 
during  we used  in funds from financing activities compared to the use of  in funds in the financing activities in included outflows of  for repayments on the revolver portion of our primary credit facility  for principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations  relating to discontinued operations and an inflow of cash from stock option exercises of the financing activities in included outflows of  for repayments on the revolver portion of our primary credit facilities   for principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations  relating to discontinued operations and an inflow of cash from stock option exercises of although we booked a full reserve for our deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter of and continued to carry this reserve as of december  and  we continue to have significant us nol s available to us to utilize as an offset to taxable income 
as of december   none of our us nol s have expired 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inventory turnover for the year ended december  averaged turns compared to turns for the decrease in this metric is mainly due to a buildup of amplifier inventory in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of a communication systems international contract that was announced by us on january   as well as the buildup of inventory for a major defense contractor order which was shipped in january our order backlog at december  was approximately  lower than in prior years  mostly due to continued delays in government orders and the completion of satcom systems orders in the majority of the backlog was related to orders that are expected to ship throughout as of december   we had made commitments to purchase approximately of production machinery and equipment  which we expect to fund through operating cash flows or the use of debt 
potential commitments in connection with our acquisition of stationary power on november   the purchase agreement specified an adjustment mechanism based upon stationary power s closing date net worth balance relative to a previously agreed amount of the final net value of the net worth  under the stock purchase agreement  was  resulting in a revised initial purchase price of  in addition  there is a contingent payout of up to  shares of our common stock to be earned upon the achievement of certain post acquisition annual sales milestones through the measurement period ended december  through the year ended december   we have issued no shares of our common stock relating to this contingent consideration  and since we have discontinued the services offered by stationary power  we do not expect to make any contingent payments 
debt and lease commitments on february   we entered into a new senior secured asset based revolving credit facility credit facility of up to  with rbs business capital  a division of rbs asset finance  inc rbs 
the proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general working capital purposes  general corporate purposes  and letter of credit foreign exchange support 
the credit facility has a maturity date of february  maturity date 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
at closing  we paid rbs a facility fee of on february   we drew down  from the credit facility to repay all outstanding amounts due under our previous credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na and manufacturers and traders trust company 
our available borrowing under the credit facility fluctuates from time to time based upon amounts of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory 
available borrowings under the credit facility equals the lesser of  or of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of a up to of the book value of our eligible inventory or b of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of our eligible inventory 
the borrowing base under the credit facility is further reduced by the face amount of any letters of credit outstanding  any liabilities of ours under hedging contracts with rbs and the value of any reserves as deemed appropriate by rbs 
we are required to have at least  available under the credit facility at all times 

table of contents on january   we entered in a first amendment to credit agreement first amendment with rbs 
the first amendment amended the credit facility as follows i eligible accounts receivable under the credit facility for the determination of available borrowings now include foreign non us accounts subject to credit insurance payable to rbs formerly  such accounts were not eligible without arranging letter of credit facilities satisfactory to rbs

if an event of default occurs  rbs would be entitled to take various actions  including accelerating the amount due under the credit facility  and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor 
as of december   we had outstanding under the credit facility 
at december   the interest rate on the asset based revolver component of the credit facility was 
as of december   the revolver arrangement had approximately  of borrowing capacity  including outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had of outstanding letters of credit related to this facility

equity transactions in october  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to  to be implemented over the course of a six month period 
repurchases were made from time to time at management s discretion  either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchases were made in compliance with securities and exchange commission guidelines and were subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
we had no obligation under the program to repurchase shares and the program could have been suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
we funded the purchase price for shares acquired primarily with current cash on hand and cash generated from operations  in addition to borrowing from our credit facility  as necessary 
we spent  to repurchase  shares of common stock  at an average price of approximately per share  under this share repurchase program 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of approximately per share  under this share repurchase program  all other share repurchases were made in the fourth quarter of in april  this share repurchase program expired 
in some of our recent acquisitions  we utilized securities as consideration in these transactions in part to reduce the need to draw on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents and revolving credit facility 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents other matters we continually explore various sources of liquidity to ensure financing flexibility  including leasing alternatives  issuing new or refinancing existing debt  and raising equity through private or public offerings 
although we stay abreast of such financing alternatives  we believe we have the ability during the next months to finance our operations primarily through internally generated funds or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to us 
in the event that we are unable to finance our operations with the internally generated funds or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to us  we may need to seek additional credit or access capital markets for additional funds 
if we are unable to achieve our plans or unforeseen events occur  we may need to implement alternative plans in addition to plans that we have already initiated 
while we believe we can complete our original plans or alternative plans  if necessary  there can be no assurance that such alternatives would be available on acceptable terms and conditions or that we would be successful in our implementation of such plans 
with respect to our battery products  we typically offer warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
with respect to our communications accessory products  we typically offer a three year warranty 
previously  we had offered up to a four year warranty 
we provide for a reserve for these potential warranty expenses  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations september  september  september  september  september  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations consist of commitments for property  plant and equipment  open purchase orders for materials and supplies  and other general commitments for various service contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates and assumptions that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
revenue recognition product sales in general  revenues from the sale of products are recognized when products are shipped 
when products are shipped with terms that require transfer of title upon delivery at a customer s location  revenues are recognized on date of delivery 
a provision is made at the time the revenue is recognized for warranty costs expected to be incurred 
customers  including distributors  do not have a general right of return on products shipped 
service contracts revenue from the sale of installation services is recognized upon customer acceptance  generally the date of installation 
revenue from fixed price engineering contracts is recognized on a proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
revenue from time and material engineering contracts is recognized as work progresses through monthly billings of time and materials as they are applied to the work pursuant to the terms in the respective contract 
revenue from customer maintenance agreements is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the related agreements  which range from six months to three years 

table of contents technology contracts we recognize revenue using the proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the contract 
elements of cost include direct material  labor and overhead 
if a loss on a contract is estimated  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
we allocate costs to all technology contracts based upon actual costs incurred including an allocation of certain research and development costs incurred 
deferred revenue for each source of revenues  we defer recognition if i evidence of an agreement does not exist  ii delivery or service has not occurred  iii the selling price is not fixed or determinable  or iv collectability is not reasonably assured 
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
our inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
we record provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand  technology developments or other economic factors 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are our purchasing practices  material and product obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials see item a risk factors for further information on foreign regulations 
we manage our exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
warranties we maintain provisions related to normal warranty claims by customers 
we evaluate these reserves quarterly based on actual experience with warranty claims to date and our assessment of additional claims in the future 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly assess all of our long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through the assistance of an independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows 
the discount rate used by us in our evaluation approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 
environmental issues environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate  in accordance with fasb s guidance on environmental remediation liabilities 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the revised fasb guidance for business combinations  the purchase price paid to effect an acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at fair value 
in accordance with fasb s guidance for the accounting of goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
we amortize intangible assets that have definite lives so that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized over their weighted average estimated useful life 

table of contents the impairment analysis of goodwill consists first of a review of various qualitative factors of the identified reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  including goodwill 
this review includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of the macroeconomic  industry or market  and cost factors relevant to the reporting unit as well as financial performance and entity or reporting unit events that may affect the value of the reporting unit 
if this review leads to the determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  further impairment testing is not required 
however  if this review cannot support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  or at our discretion  quantitative impairment steps are performed 
this qualitative review is not applied to our other indefinite lived intangible assets 
the quantitative impairment test for goodwill consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which it is assigned 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets with their carrying amounts 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on a discounted cash flow model 
we determine the fair value of our intangibles assets with indefinite lives trademarks through the relief from a royalty income valuation approach 
we conduct our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in october of each fiscal year 
for  we have identified five goodwill reporting units for analysis 
we performed a qualitative analysis for four reporting units and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its respective carrying amount 
due to the narrow margin of passing the impairment testing in  we elected to forego the qualitative assessment and perform quantitative impairment testing on our redblack reporting unit 
although this analysis did not indicate impairment  the margin of passing was again narrow for our analysis 
as a result  a potential full or partial impairment may occur in if the projected operating results are not achieved or if we cannot sell the reporting unit for at least its carrying value 
one of the key assumptions for achieving the projected operational results includes significant revenue growth 
although we are projecting revenue growth  we have determined that redblack offers limited opportunities to achieve the operating margin thresholds of our new business model 
as of december   the redblack reporting unit had a goodwill carrying value of  for  we identified four trademarks for testing and  as a result of that testing  no impairment was indicated 
however  due to the narrow margin of passing the testing in  there is potential that the mcdowell communications systems trademark may become partially or fully impaired in if the projected revenue targets are not met 
as of december   the mcdowell communications systems trademark had a carrying value of  stock based compensation we follow the provisions of fasb s guidance on share based payments  which requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we calculate expected volatility for stock options by taking an average of historical volatility over the past five years and a computation of implied volatility 
the computation of expected term was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
income taxes we apply fasb s guidance in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that may be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in  and  in the us and the us  we continued to report a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets that cannot be offset by reversing temporary differences 
this results from the conclusion that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize our us and us nol s that had accumulated over time 
the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets resulted from our evaluation of all available 
table of contents evidence  both positive and negative 
the assessment of the realizability of the nol s was based on a number of factors including  our history of net operating losses  the volatility of our earnings  our historical operating volatility  our historical inability to accurately forecast earnings for future periods and the continued uncertainty of the general business climate as of the end of we concluded that these factors represent sufficient negative evidence and have concluded that we should record a full valuation allowance under fasb s guidance on the accounting for income taxes 
in and  we reported a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in china 
as a result of our assessment at december   there is no longer a need to record a valuation allowance for the chinese deferred tax assets as we determined that it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
we are more likely than not to fully utilize the nol in china and therefore have removed the immaterial valuation allowance during we continually assess the carrying value of this asset based on relevant accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks in the normal course of business  primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
our primary interest rate risk is derived from our outstanding variable rate credit facility 
in connection with our credit facility with rbs  at december   the interest rate is variable based on libor plus 
the impact of a one percentage point change in the interest rate associated with the rbs credit facility would not have a material impact on our interest expense 
we are subject to foreign currency risk  due to fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar 
in the year ended december   approximately of our sales were denominated in us dollars 
the remainder of our sales was denominated in uk pounds sterling  euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars  indian rupee and chinese yuan renminbi 
a change in the value of the pound sterling  the euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  the rupee or the yuan renminbi to the us dollar would have impacted our revenues during such period by approximately 
we monitor the relationship between the us dollar and other currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in these foreign currencies as appropriate to safeguard against the fluctuations in the currency relative to the us dollar 
we currently do not utilize derivative or other similar financial instruments to hedge our interest rate or foreign currency risks
