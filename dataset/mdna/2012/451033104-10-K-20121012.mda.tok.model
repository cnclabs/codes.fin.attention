item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements you should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion includes forward looking statements and you should read the section titled disclosure regarding forward looking statements appearing at the beginning of this annual report on form k for a description of the risks and assumptions associated with such statements 
overview ibio is a biotechnology company focused on commercializing its proprietary technologies  the ibiolaunch platform for vaccines and therapeutic proteins  as well as the ibiomodulator platform for vaccine enhancement 
our strategy is to promote our technology  through commercial product collaborations and license arrangements 
we expect to share in the increased value of our technology through upfront license fees  milestone revenues  service revenues  and royalties on end products 
we believe our technology offers the opportunity to develop products that might not otherwise be commercially feasible  and to work with both corporate and government clients to reduce their costs during product development and meet their needs for low cost  high quality biologics manufacturing systems and vaccines with improved properties 
our near term focus is to establish business arrangements for use of our technology by licensees for the development and production of products for both therapeutic and vaccine uses 
vaccine candidates presently being advanced on our proprietary platform are applicable to newly emerging strains of hn swine like influenza  hn avian influenza  yellow fever  and anthrax 
therapeutic candidates presently being advanced on our proprietary platform include human alpha galactosidase a for the treatment of fabry disease  a modified version of human c esterase inhibitor for the treatment of hereditary angioedema and other diseases  human alpha antitrypsin for treatment of disorders caused by a lack or deficiency of alpha antitrypsin  and several other therapeutic protein targets including antibodies  for which preliminary product feasibility has been demonstrated 
in order to attract appropriate licensees and increase the value of our share of such intended contractual arrangements  we engaged the fhcmb in to perform research and development activities to develop the ibiolaunch platform and to create our first product candidate 
we selected a plant based influenza vaccine for human use as the product candidate to exemplify the value of the platform 
based on research conducted by fhcmb  our proprietary technology is applicable to the production of vaccines for any strain of influenza including strains of hn swine like influenza 
a phase clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for hn influenza  based on ibio s technology  was initiated in september we announced positive interim results in june and successfully completed the clinical trial in march the vaccine candidate demonstrated strong induction of dose correlated immune responses  with or without adjuvant  as assessed by virus microneutralization antibody assays and hai responses 
the vaccine was safe and well tolerated at all doses when administered with and without adjuvant 
in connection with the research and development agreement  fhcmb agreed to use its best efforts to obtain grants from governmental and non governmental entities to fund additional development of our proprietary plant based technology 
consequently  in addition to the funding we have provided through agreements to fhcmb  fhcmb has received funding from the bill melinda gates foundation for development of various vaccines based upon our proprietary technology including an experimental vaccine for hn avian influenza 
a phase clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for hn influenza  based on ibio s technology  was initiated in december we announced positive interim results in june and successfully completed the clinical trial in march in addition to the platform and product development engagements  in  the company engaged fhcmb to create a prototype production module for products made through the use of the platform 
the purpose of this engagement was to demonstrate the ease and economy with which platform based products could be manufactured in order to attract potential licensees and increase the value of our share of such business arrangements 
the prototype design  which encompasses the entire production process from seeding through pre infiltration plant growth  infiltration with agrobacteria  harvesting of plant tissue and purification of target proteins  was completed in may a pilot plant based upon this prototype was subsequently constructed in the fhcmb facility in newark  delaware 
this pilot plant  and the equipment in it  is owned by fhcmb and has been validated for cgmp production 
it is expected to be used for cgmp production of protein targets for clinical trials of product candidates utilizing our platform technology 
in january  we announced the grant of a commercial  royalty bearing license to fiocruz of brazil to develop  manufacture and sell certain vaccines based upon our proprietary technology 
fiocruz will invest million to bring the first product candidate  a yellow fever vaccine  through a phase i clinical trial 
the world health organization has estimated that  unvaccinated people contract yellow fever each year  and approximately  die from the disease 
development of the yellow fever vaccine candidate will be performed through a commercial collaboration among the company  fiocruz  and fhcmb 
the license covers the nations of latin america  the caribbean and africa 
the company retains the right to sell the products developed under the license and collaboration agreement in any other territory with a royalty back to fiocruz bio manguinhos 
bio manguinhos is a unit of the oswaldo cruz foundation  a central agency of the ministry of health of brazil 
fiocruz bio manguinhos produces and develops immunobiological items to respond to public health demands 
its product line consists of vaccines  reagents and biopharmaceuticals 
fiocruz is a leading company in the national export of human vaccines and a major participant in total export sales of the brazilian pharmaceutical sector 
fiocruz is one of the main producers of vaccines and diagnostics for infectious diseases in latin america 
fiocruz is a certified world health organization provider to united nations agencies  and is a leading world manufacturer of yellow fever vaccine  which it has exported to over countries 
in february  may and june  we announced the issuance or allowance of us patents for  and scientific progress with potential product applications of our ibiomodulator platform  also referred to as our license fusion protein technology 
the company established non commercial arrangements among the company  certain government entities  ngo and fhcmb  pursuant to which the company grants non commercial rights to use its platform for the development and production by fhcmb of product candidates selected by the government entities and ngo  in consideration for grants by the government entities and ngo directly to fhcmb to fund such research and development 
through i the company fhcmb contracts and ii the non commercial arrangements described above which we refer to collectively as the business structure  the company retains ownership of the intellectual property and exclusive worldwide commercial rights in the fields of human health and veterinary influenza applications of the intellectual property 
the company licenses or otherwise grants use rights a to government and ngo entities for not for profit applications of the intellectual property for the development or application for which they granted or were granted funding  and b to fhcmb for research purposes and applications in other fields 
at this time  the company is not pursuing development in the area of veterinary influenza 
this business structure helps the company to enhance the value of commercial rights and the scope of applications of its platform technology 
it also helps the company demonstrate the validity and apparent value of the platform to parties to whom it will offer licenses or other business opportunities 
outsourcing our research and development work allows us to develop our product candidates  and thereby promote the value of our platform for licensing and product development purposes  without bearing the full risk and expense of establishing and maintaining our own research and development staff and facilities 
fhcmb is engaged to perform research and development for the yellow fever vaccine project based on their expertise 
the contract with fhcmb is expected to be million 
service revenues and research expense under this arrangement commenced in january the amount of revenues recorded under this agreement and related research and development expenses for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively 
the company invoices the customer in us dollars and also receives collection of the outstanding receivable in us dollars 
therefore  there are no foreign currency exchange translation gains or losses involved with this customer 
in july we announced a global alliance with ge healthcare gehc to commercialize our plant based technologies for the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines 
the alliance is intended to build on the existing development and marketing agreement between the two companies announced in and to combine ibio s proprietary ibiolaunch platform with gehc s capabilities in start to finish technologies for biopharmaceutical manufacturing 
under the terms of the agreement  ibio will be the preferred provider of vaccine or therapeutic product manufacturing technology incorporating a plant based protein expression system  while gehc will be the preferred provider of engineering services and bioprocess solutions  to any customers that may be interested in a bio manufacturing facility incorporating a plant based expression system 
the agreement further specifies allocation of responsibilities for product development  process scale up  facilities design and development  and technology transfer among ibio  fhcmb  and gehc 
the agreement also sets forth the terms of a non exclusive license to ibio s technology that ibio has agreed to offer to any customer referred by gehc pursuant to the agreement 
the company s platform technology is sometimes referred to as ibiolaunch technology or the ibiolaunch platform  and the category of this technology is sometimes referred to as plant based technology or as a plant based platform 
the company has exclusive control over  and the rights to ownership of  the intellectual property related to all human health and veterinary influenza applications of the plant based technology developed by fhcmb 
current development projects include conducting proof of principle preclinical studies and conducting clinical studies of proprietary influenza vaccines 
many biotech drugs have been on the market long enough for patents on them to expire 
emerging opportunities for biosimilars also known as biogenerics or follow on biologics create potential for our platform technology to be used by potential licensees to enter the market utilizing what the company expects to be an economical production system 
the company is seeking commercial partners for this category of products and is unlikely to develop products in this category without the financial and marketing support of a commercial partner 
historically  in addition to the development of the platform technology described in the preceding paragraphs  the company has also generated sales of nutritional supplements utilizing plants as sources of high quality nutritional minerals 
the company has a patented process for hydroponic growth of edible plants that causes them to accumulate high levels of important nutritional minerals such as chromium  selenium  iron and zinc 
the company utilized the services of various wholly owned subsidiaries of our former parent to support the production  marketing and sales of these phytomineral products 
effective in april  the company entered into an agreement with iht health products  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of our former parent iht wherein it granted an exclusive license to the company s patented process in consideration for a royalty of five percent of net sales and the obligation of iht to maintain in force and good standing the company s patent and related intellectual property 
at the same time  rights under the existing customer agreements were beneficially transferred to iht 
ibio receives royalty income from the exclusive license to iht 
in november  the board of directors of our former parent approved a plan to distribute its equity interests in the company to its stockholders in the form of a dividend 
the record date of the dividend was august  with a distribution date of august  the stockholders of our former parent received one share of the company s common stock for each share of common stock they owned of the former parent as of the record date 
immediately following the spin off  the company became a public company with stock traded on the otc bulletin board under the symbol ibpm 
the company s stock was listed for trading on the nyse mkt in january results of operations for the years ended june  versus june  revenues revenues for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively 
revenues were attributable to providing technology services to fiocruz to assist them in implementing the company s technology for a future phase clinical trial of yellow fever 
the company signed a contract with fiocruz in january there was no license income for the years ended june  and research and development expense research and development expense for the year ended june  was approximately  compared to  for the year ended june   a difference of  from the comparable period in this increase primarily relates to approximately  for fhcmb to service the yellow fever vaccine contract with fiocruz using ibio s technology 
the company increased its research and development activities during the year ended june  as compared to june  based upon several factors as follows 
the company entered into a research project project in december with fhcmb to evaluate gene expression and protein production  and to focus on a series of product candidates using the ibiolaunch platform  and the expenses related to project for the year ended june  increased by approximately  as compared to the comparable period in the focus was to determine feasibility and relative priority  for business development purposes  of several protein therapeutic candidates that are representative of market classes of products 
for example  two market classes are monoclonal antibodies and plasma derived proteins 
the company entered into an additional project with fhcmb project which was completed during the year ended june  and the related expenses to project increased by  for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  this project is to evaluate the mechanism of immune potentiating activity of lickm  which is a thermostable bacterial enzyme used as a carrier molecule for vaccine antigens 
another increase in research and development expense is also attributed to the company incurring approximately  for outside services to a related party  to perform laboratory feasibility analyses of gene expression and protein purification and also preparation of research samples 
the tech transfer agreement tta with fhcmb has an annual obligation of million for five years that commenced in this expense increased by  for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  this was due to the build out of a pilot plant at fhcmb that was expensed during the year ended june  the accounting for the tta is to expense such amounts as services are rendered 
in addition  share based compensation expense for options decreased the during the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  by approximately  primarily due to certain options that are revalued each reporting period using the black scholes option pricing model 
the stock price is a component in the black scholes calculation  which is used to compute fair market value 
changes in the company s closing stock price can result in fluctuations in share based compensation results between reported periods 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense for the year ended june  was approximately  compared to  for the year ended june   a decrease of  the decrease is primarily attributed to a reduction in share based compensation expense for warrants issued to consultants of approximately  additionally  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  and  during the fourth quarter of june  and  respectively 
impairment expense decreased by  for the year ended june  as compared to the prior year 
evaluating for impairment requires judgment  including the estimation of future cash flows  future growth rates and profitability and the expected life over which cash flows will occur 
changes in the company s business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of the year ended june   the company re evaluated its business strategy and reviewed its product portfolio 
after such review  the company s near term potential for upfront milestone revenue and or licensing deals led to further evaluation of its intangible assets 
other decreases in general and administrative expenses include less expense for investment relations services of  past consulting services by the former cfo of approximately  and public company listing fees of approximately  there was a decrease in share based compensation expense for options of approximately  that included two option modifications during the year ended june  in november and december  the board of directors modified the cancellation provision of previously issued options  permitting an option holder  upon termination without cause  to exercise the vested portion of an option post termination up to ten years after the grant date 
current period option awards granted also include this provision 
the company estimates the effect of the modification to be approximately  which will be expensed over the vesting terms  of which approximately  is recorded in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations 
for the year ended june   the amount charged to general and administrative expense was approximately  the remaining amount of  will be expensed in subsequent periods over the vesting terms 
other increases relate to writing down an asset to its net realizable value of approximately  consulting services of  of which  was to a member of the board of directors  and payroll and benefits increased by approximately  relating to the hiring of two employees and an increase of overall salaries for existing officers 
other income expenses the derivative financial liability non cash income for the year ended june  was approximately  as compared to a non cash charge of approximately  for the year ended june  this resulted in an increase of non cash income of approximately  for the year ended june  as compared to the comparable period in however  it was also affected by the issuance of additional warrants as a result of the january equity offering due to the anti dilution provision that was part of the august equity offering 
the increase in other income change in derivative financial liability of approximately  primarily results from decreases in the stock price at june  as compared to june  the calculation of this derivative financial liability is affected by factors which are subject to significant fluctuations and are not under the company s control 
this liability resulted from warrants included in the august equity offering with an anti dilution provision 
therefore  the resulting effect upon our net income or loss is subject to significant fluctuations and will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations until the warrants either expire in august or are exercised prior to that date 
the accounting guidance applicable to these warrants requires the company assuming all other inputs to the pricing model remain constant to record a non cash charge when the company s stock price is rising and to record non cash income when the company s stock price is falling 
net loss per share based upon the above  the net loss for the years ended june  and approximated  and  or and per share  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since the spinoff from its former parent in august as of june   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately  and cash used in operating activities for the years ended june  and approximated  and  respectively 
the company has historically financed its activities through the sale of common stock and warrants 
through june   the company has dedicated most of its financial resources to investing in its ibiolaunch platform  advancing intellectual property  product candidate development  and general and administrative activities 
these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
these financial statements were prepared under the assumption that the company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of that uncertainty 
in addition  the company estimates that the cash on hand as of june  of approximately  will be adequate to fund its operations until the end of the second calendar quarter of the company plans to fund its further development and commercialization through licensing and partnering arrangements  which may include milestone receipts and royalties  and or the sale of equity securities or debt 
the company cannot be certain that such funding will be available on acceptable terms or available at all 
to the extent that the company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities  its stockholders may experience dilution 
further  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt  such instruments may have powers  designations  preferences or rights senior to its currently outstanding securities 
if the company is unable to raise funds when required or on acceptable terms  it may have to a significantly delay  scale back  or discontinue the development and or commercialization of one or more product candidates  b seek collaborators for product candidates at an earlier stage than would otherwise be desirable and or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  or c relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies  product candidates  or products that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself and d possibly cease operations 
on july   the company filed with the sec a registration statement on form s under the securities act  which was declared effective by the sec on july  this registration statement allows the company  from time to time  to offer and sell shares of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  purchase its securities and or debt securities  up to a maximum aggregate amount of million of such securities 
the company raised gross proceeds of million in january under this registration statement 
for the years ended june  and  the company had net cash used in operating activities of approximately  and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june   was primarily from the loss from operations of  which was adjusted for the effects of non cash income for stock based compensation expense  change in the fair value of the derivative financial liability  depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangible assets and a vendor concession by approximately  in addition  there were increases in cash for accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  other receivables  other current assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling approximately  for the year ended june   the net cash used in operating activities was primarily from the loss from operations of approximately  which was adjusted for the effects of non cash expenses for stock based compensation expense  change in fair value of derivative instrument liability  depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets of approximately  in addition  there were decreases in cash for accounts receivables  prepaid expenses  other receivables  other current assets  and accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling approximately for the years ended june  and  net cash used from investing activities was approximately  and  respectively  which was primarily from additions for intangible assets 
for the years ended june  and  the cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and  respectively  which was primarily from the sale of common stock and warrants  net of expenses 
the company acquired technology from fhcmb through a tta dated in december  as amended 
terms of the tta require the company to a make payments to fhcmb of  per year for five years  aggregating  for research and development services beginning in november  and b pay fhcmb of all receipts derived by the company from sales of products produced utilizing the technology and of all receipts derived by the company from licensing the technology to third parties with an overall minimum annual payment of  beginning with the twelve months ended december  this agreement is for years 
for the years ended june  and  the expense approximated  and  respectively 
in december  the company and fhcmb entered into a  research services agreement to evaluate gene expression and protein production  focused on a series of product candidates  using the ibiolaunch platform 
the expense for the years ended june  and was approximately  and  respectively 
remaining minimum payments due under the commitments to fhcmb as of june  are as follows for the year ended june  thereafter total we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant estimates are valuation and recovery of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  valuation of derivative financial liability and income taxes and valuation of income taxes 
research and development research and development costs primarily consist of salaries and benefits  research contracts for the advancement of product development  stock based compensation  and consultants 
the company expenses all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred 
stock based compensation the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
compensation expense for options and warrants granted to non employees is determined by the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees is measured each period as the underlying options or warrants vest 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income or expense in the period that the change is effective 
tax benefits are recognized when it is probable that the deduction will be sustained 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will either expire before the company is able to realize the benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
as of june  and  the company had recognized a valuation allowance to the full extent of our net deferred tax assets since the likelihood of realization of the benefit does not meet the more likely than not threshold 
the company files a us federal income tax return as well as returns for various states 
the company s income taxes have not been examined by any tax jurisdiction since its spin off in august uncertain tax positions taken on our tax returns will be accounted for as liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
the company will recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations 
there were no liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions at june  or the open tax years  subject to potential examination by the applicable taxing authority  for the company are derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc derivatives and hedging the embedded august warrants are not considered indexed to our stock 
as a result of the anti dilution provision per the warrant agreement from the august equity raise  the august warrants were required to be accounted for as derivative financial liability and have been recognized as a liability on the balance sheet 
the fair value of the derivative instrument liability is determined using the black scholes option pricing model and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility  the contractual term  and the risk free interest rate 
the derivative financial liability is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any changes in fair value is recognized as component of other income expense 
intangible assets the company accounts for intangible assets at their historical cost and records amortization utilizing the straight line method over periods based upon their estimated useful lives 
intellectual property is amortized over a period from eighteen to twenty three years and patents over ten years 
the company reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
evaluating for impairment requires judgment  including the estimation of future cash flows  future growth rates and profitability and the expected life over which cash flows will occur 
changes in the company s business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of june   the company re evaluated its business strategy and reviewed its product portfolio 
after such review  the company s near term potential for upfront  milestone revenue and or licensing deals led to further evaluation of its intellectual property including its patents 
the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in may  accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurement was amended to develop common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has significantly affected its results of operations 
seasonality our operations are not impacted by seasonality 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests its excess cash to ensure both liquidity and safety of principal 
excess cash is invested in a strong financial grade institution to reduce the company s credit risk 
at times  the company s cash balances may exceed federally insured amounts 
the company has an exposure to credit risk in its trade accounts receivable from sales of it services 
the entire accounts receivable and service revenues are derived from one customer located in brazil 
the company was required to account for the august warrants as derivative liabilities 
the company is required to mark to market in each reporting quarter the value of the embedded derivative and the august warrants 
the company revalues these derivative liabilities at the end of each reporting period 
the periodic change in value of the derivative liabilities is recorded as either non cash derivative gain if the value of the embedded derivative and august warrants decrease or as non cash derivative loss if the value of the embedded derivative and august warrants increase 
although the values of the embedded derivative and august warrants are affected by interest rates  the remaining contractual exercise period and the company s stock volatility  the primary cause of the change in the values will be the price of the company s common stock 
if the stock price increases  the derivative financial liability will generally increase  and if the stock price decreases the derivative financial liability will generally decrease 
this results in a non cash expense or income to the statements of operations
