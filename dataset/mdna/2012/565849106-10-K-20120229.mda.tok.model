environmental  health and safety matters the health  environmental  safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues  including environmental  health and safety matters 
our corporate health  environment  safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs 
we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties 
our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  health and safety 
these laws and regulations include the occupational safety and health act osha with respect to the protection of health and safety of employees  the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the federal water pollution control act also known as the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances  the oil pollution act of opa with respect to oil pollution and response  the national environmental policy act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts  the endangered species act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  and the us emergency planning and community right to know act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories 
in addition  many other states and countries in which where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters 
these laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances  including crude oil  into the environment  or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal 
in some cases  these 
table of contents laws can impose liability for the entire cost of clean up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others such as prior owners or operators of our assets or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined 
based on regulatory trends  particularly with respect to the caa and its implementing regulations  we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations 
however  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities  marketing areas and production processes

air in august  the us environmental protection agency us epa published proposed new source performance standards nsps and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that will both amend existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities as well as create a new nsps for oil and gas production  transmission and distribution facilities 
if the proposed rules are finalized without substantial modification  compliance with the rules will result in an increase in costs of control  equipment and labor and require additional notification  monitoring  reporting and recordkeeping 
the us epa is required to finalize this rule by april  in july  the us epa finalized a federal implementation plan under the caa that includes new source review nsr regulations which apply to air emissions sources on tribal lands 
this rule became effective on august   and requires the registration and or pre construction permitting of most of our facilities on tribal lands in wyoming  oklahoma and north dakota 
to minimize pre construction delays in the near term  we entered into an administrative compliance and consent agreement agreement that temporarily suspended the requirement for pre construction permits for facilities on trial lands in north dakota as long as permit applications were filed in accordance with the agreement 
we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of these permitting requirements until the us epa finalizes its internal permitting procedures 
the us epa has indicated that this rule will be finalized during the first half of climate change in  the us epa promulgated rules that required us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions 
further  state  national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cased promulgated 
these requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate 
potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations 
the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time 
for additional information  see item a 
risk factors 
as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship  we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations 
we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates 
in addition  we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective 
hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water  sand  and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore 
hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state level through permitting and compliance requirements 
state level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices  limit water withdrawals and water use  require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents  restrict which additives may be used  or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing 
in addition  the us congress has considered legislation that would require regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process 
in the first quarter of  the us epa announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
the us epa has begun preparation for the study and expects to issue an interim report in followed by a final report in increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques 
additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays  or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 
the adoption of any federal or state laws or the 
table of contents implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs  which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells 
remediation the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open pit mine  extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils 
tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds 
the aosp is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work 
the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan 
the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate alternate tailings management technologies 
in february  the alberta energy resources conservation board ercb issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings 
the aosp joint venture operator submitted tailings management papers to the ercb for both mines setting forth plans to comply with the directive which received approval  with conditions  in the second half of further new regulations or failure to comply in a timely manner could result in additional cost to us 
concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties  a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy related industries

the majority of those transactions occurred while mpc was a wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  for the years and  sales of crude oil to the libyan national oil company accounted for more than percent of our annual revenues 
these transactions were restricted to sales of crude oil produced in libya during those periods

item a 
risk factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business 
the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets 
prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas fluctuate widely 
our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas 
historically  the markets for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are beyond our control 
these factors include worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  changes in weather patterns and climate  natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados  the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and general economic conditions worldwide 
the long term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are uncertain 
lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce  which may reduce our revenues  operating income and cash flows 
significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets 

table of contents our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us 
offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment 
activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers 
environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities 
estimates of liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions  including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates 
any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves 
the proved reserve information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates 
estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed  on a selected basis  by our corporate reserves group 
the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj petroleum consultants  a third party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands 
reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the month period ended december   as well as other conditions in existence at the date 
any significant future price change will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves 
future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation  among other things 
reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons  natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured 
bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil 
estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions  including location  size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid  rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation  historical production from the area  compared with production from other comparable producing areas  volumes of bitumen in place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and repair costs  and industry economic conditions  levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations 
as a result  different petroleum engineers  each using industry accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods  may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data 
because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates  each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated the amount and timing of production  the revenues and costs associated with that production  and the amount and timing of future development expenditures 
the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by sec rule of regulation s x  the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the month period ended december   and costs applicable at the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
in addition  the percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general 

table of contents if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves  our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline  thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition 
the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  optimize production performance  identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves  our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced 
accordingly  to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce  our future revenues will decline 
creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors  including obtaining rights to explore for  develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas  drilling success  the ability to complete long lead time  capital intensive projects timely and on budget  the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs  and the ability to fund such activity 
future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 
drilling for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires  explosions  blowouts and surface cratering  lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods  and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment 
if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner  or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering  procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results 
delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce 
such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors  many of which are beyond our control  including denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and or permits  unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor  disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or other events such as equipment malfunctions  explosions  fires or spills affecting our facilities  or those of vendors or suppliers  shortages of sufficiently skilled labor  or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages  market related increases in a project s debt or equity financing costs  and nonperformance by  or disputes with  vendors  suppliers  contractors or subcontractors 
any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects 

table of contents we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with  and changes in environmental health  safety and security laws and regulations  and  as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operation and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our businesses are subject to numerous laws  regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment  including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas  waste management  pollution prevention  greenhouse gas emissions  as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security 
we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products  our operating results will be adversely affected 
the specific impact of these laws and regulations may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes 
we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations  install pollution control equipment  perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect business  financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new  amended or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us 
we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent  causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue  with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations 
currently  various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of review  discussion or implementation in countries where we operate  including the us  canada  and norway  and the european union 
our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions 
through  domestic legislative and regulatory efforts included proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs  each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
further  in december at the durban climate change conference  countries such as the us  china and india  and the european union agreed in principal to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in with a new legally binding agreement 
however  at this time it is not certain whether a legally binding resolution will be reached  what the terms of any agreement would be  or whether the us senate would ratify such an agreement 
these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities  capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities  and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs 
these costs and capital expenditures could be material 
although uncertain  these developments could increase our costs  reduce the demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 
although there may be adverse financial impact including compliance costs  potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas associated with any legislation  regulation  or other action by the us epa  the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented 
private party litigation has also been brought against some emitters of greenhouse gas emissions 
the potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells 
hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water  sand  and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore 
the us congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process 
consideration of new federal regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise 
the us epa announced in the first quarter of its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
the us epa has begun preparation for the study and expects to issue an interim report in followed by a final report in in addition  various state level initiatives in regions with substantial shale gas resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices  limit water withdrawals and water use  require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents  restrict which additives may be used  or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing 
increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition  including litigation  to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques 
additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas  including from the developing shale plays  or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 
the adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs 

table of contents worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 
local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us 
a total of percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in was derived from production outside the us and percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december   were located outside the us all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada 
we are  therefore  subject to the political  geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located within or outside of the us there are many risks associated with operations in countries and in global markets  such as equatorial guinea  indonesia  libya and the iraqi kurdistan region  including changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas  bitumen or synthetic crude oil pricing and taxation  other political  economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations  political and economic instability  war  acts of terrorism and civil disturbances  the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation  may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens  and fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages and currency controls 
since january  there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests  including demonstrations which have been marked by violence  within some countries in the middle east including bahrain  egypt  libya  syria  tunisia and yemen 
some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest 
if such unrest continues to spread  conflicts could result in civil wars  regional conflicts  and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the us these may have the following results  among others volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy  resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products  negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted  security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel  damage to  or the inability to access  production facilities or other operating assets  and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations 
continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries 
a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption  which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 
these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas 
in addition  these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate 
actions of governments through tax and other legislation  executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability  both in the us and abroad 
the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries 
these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in  or gain access to  opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future 
many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners  which may decrease our ability to manage risk 
we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations  such oil and gas exploration and production  oil sands mining or pipeline transportation  with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations 
however  these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs  particularly where we are not the operator 
we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations 
in addition  misconduct  fraud  noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation 
our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 
we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 
our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  spills  hurricanes and other adverse weather  tsunamis  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions or nuclear or 
table of contents other disasters  labor disputes and accidents 
our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires  earthquakes  explosions or other interruptions 
these same risks can be applied to the third parties which transport crude oil from our facilities 
a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs 
our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life  significant damage to property and equipment  environmental pollution  impairment of operations and substantial losses to us 
various hazards have adversely affected us in the past  and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 
we maintain insurance against many  but not all  potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent 
uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital  exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
historically  we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities  with significant self insured retentions 
in the future  we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further 
in some instances  certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  due to hurricane activity in recent years  the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or  in many instances  it is prohibitively expensive 
as a result  our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased 
litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance 
we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future 
the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities  privacy laws  antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations 
in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants  and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances 
if we are not able to successfully defend such claims  they may result in substantial liability 
we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities 
in addition to substantial liability  litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations 
in connection with our separation from mpc  mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities 
however  there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities  or that mpc s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future 
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin off  mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities 
however  third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume  and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities  or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations 
in addition  even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable  we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 
the spin off could result in substantial tax liability 
we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin off qualified as tax free to mpc  us and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections and and related provisions of the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect  then we will not be able to rely on the ruling 
furthermore  the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax free treatment under section of the code 
rather  the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied  and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling 
in connection with the spin off  we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel  substantially to the effect that  the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin off qualified as tax free to mpc  us and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections and and related provisions of the code 
the opinion relied on  among other things  the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which  if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect  would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion 
the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts  and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail 

table of contents if  notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel  the spin off were determined not to qualify under section of the code  each us holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received 
that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin off 
for each such stockholder  any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 
we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares 
under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin off  mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin off and or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax free treatment as a result of actions taken  or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement  by mpc or any of its affiliates 
however  if the spin off and or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates  we would be responsible for all such taxes 
we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue  without the approval of our stockholders  one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional and other rights  including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions  as our board of directors generally may determine 
the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock
