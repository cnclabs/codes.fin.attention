background and overview we are an education services holding company that owns strayer university 
strayer university is an institution of higher education which offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs at campuses in alabama  arkansas  delaware  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  louisiana  maryland  mississippi  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  utah  virginia  west virginia  wisconsin  and washington  dc  and worldwide via the internet 
we plan to open a total of eight new campuses in  subject to regulatory approvals 
set forth below are average enrollment  full time tuition rates  revenues  income from operations  net income  and diluted net income per share for the last three years 
year ended december  average enrollment change from prior year full time tuition per course change from prior year revenues in thousands change from prior year income from operations in thousands change from prior year net income in thousands change from prior year diluted net income per share change from prior year 
table of contents strayer university derives approximately of its revenue from tuition collected from its students 
the academic year of the university is divided into four quarters  which approximately coincide with the four quarters of the calendar year 
students make payment arrangements for the tuition for each course prior to the beginning of the quarter 
tuition revenue is recognized in the quarter of instruction 
if a student withdraws from a course prior to completion  the university refunds a portion of the tuition depending on when the withdrawal occurs 
tuition revenue is shown net of any refunds  withdrawals  corporate discounts  employee tuition discounts and scholarships 
the university also derives revenue from other sources such as textbook related income  application fees  technology fees  placement test fees  withdrawal fees  and other income  which are all recognized when earned 
we record tuition receivable and unearned tuition for our students upon the start of the academic term 
because the university s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters  at the end of the fiscal quarter and academic term  tuition receivable represents amounts due from students for educational services already provided and unearned tuition represents advance payments from students for academic services to be provided in the future 
based upon past experience and judgment  the university establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable not included in unearned tuition 
any uncollected account more than six months past due is charged against the allowance 
our bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december    and was  and  respectively 
effective during the first quarter of  we made changes in our presentation of operating expenses and reclassified prior periods to conform to the current presentation 
we determined that these changes would provide more meaningful information and increased transparency of our operations 
there were no changes to the total operating expenses or operating income as a result of these reclassifications 
below is a description of the nature of the costs included in our operating expense categories instruction and educational support expenses generally contain items of expense directly attributable to educational activities of the university 
this expense category includes salaries and benefits of faculty and academic administrators  as well as administrative personnel who support and serve student interests 
instruction and educational support expenses also include costs of educational supplies and facilities  including rent for campus facilities  certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories and all other physical plant and occupancy costs  with the exception of costs attributable to the corporate offices 
bad debt expense incurred on delinquent student account balances is also included in instruction and educational support expenses 
marketing expenses include the costs of advertising and production of marketing materials  and related personnel costs 
admissions advisory expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs of personnel engaged in admissions 
general and administration expenses include salaries and benefits of management and employees engaged in accounting  human resources  legal  regulatory compliance  and other corporate functions  along with the occupancy and other related costs attributable to such functions 
investment income consists primarily of earnings and realized gains or losses on investments  and interest expense is incurred on our outstanding borrowings 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management 
table of contents evaluates its estimates and judgments related to its allowance for uncollectible accounts  income tax provisions  the useful lives of property and equipment  valuation of deferred tax assets  goodwill  and intangible assets  valuation of its interest rate swap arrangement  forfeiture rates for stock based compensation plans  and accrued expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
tuition revenue is recognized as income  net of any refunds or withdrawals  in the respective quarter of instruction 
advance registrations for the next quarter are recorded as unearned tuition at the start of each academic term 
any cash received prior to the start of an academic term is recorded as unearned tuition 
we record estimates for our allowance for uncollectible accounts for tuition receivable from students 
if the financial condition of our students were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make required payments for tuition payable to us  additional allowances may be required 
we record estimates for certain of our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities 
we estimate the useful lives of our property and equipment 
we periodically assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
we assess the value of our interest rate swap arrangement every quarter 
we periodically review our assumed forfeiture rates for stock based awards and adjust them as necessary 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to our accrued expenses  carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  and income tax liabilities may be required 
new campuses our goal is to serve the demand for post secondary adult education nationwide by opening new campuses every year 
a new campus typically requires up to million in upfront capital costs for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computer equipment 
in the first year of operation  assuming a mid year opening  we expect to incur operating losses of approximately million including depreciation related to the upfront capital costs 
a new campus is typically expected to begin generating operating income on a quarterly basis in six quarters of operation  which is generally upon reaching an enrollment level of about students 
our new campus notional model assumes an increase of average enrollment by students per year until reaching a level of about  students 
given the potential internal rate of return achieved with each new campus opening new campuses is an important part of our strategy 
although during the fall term nearly of the student body opted to take of their classes online that quarter  we believe opening new campuses and having the option to attend classes on campus is important to attracting  retaining and servicing students 
we believe we have sufficient capital resources from cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash generated from operating activities and availability on our credit facility discussed below to continue to open new campuses for at least the next months 
we plan to open eight new campuses in subject to regulatory approval 
we opened eight new campuses in and in see new campuses opened table in item for information regarding the locations of these new campuses 
global online operations centers we have two global online operations centers to accommodate the demand among students who neither live nor work near a physical campus location 
one operations center is located in chantilly  virginia and the other is located in salt lake city  utah 

table of contents results of operations in  we generated million in revenue  a decrease compared to  primarily as a result of a decline in average enrollment of  offset in part by a tuition increase which commenced in january income from operations was million in  a decrease of compared to net income in was million  a decrease of compared to earnings per diluted share was in compared to in  a decrease of  reflecting the lower share count due to share repurchases 
key enrollment trends by quarter were as follows academic term change change in new students winter spring summer fall average although we do not know for sure why our recent enrollment trends and that of the proprietary higher education sector generally have been negative  we believe that the increased unemployment rate and the resulting lower confidence in job prospects are contributing factors 
the decline in our new students in will have an adverse impact on enrollment since there will be fewer students from continuing their education in we cannot predict future enrollments or whether new student enrollment will decline further  stabilize or increase in response to the economy or other factors 
we can describe what we think our business model may look like financially under different enrollment scenarios 
we implemented a tuition increase in and announced our plan to open eight new campuses in subject to regulatory approval 
based on this investment plan  assuming we continue to increase our expenditures on faculty  marketing and admissions advisory services as we open new campuses and assuming  diluted weighted average shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of  the company expects its business model may perform as follows

seasonality our quarterly results of operations tend to vary significantly within a year because of student enrollment patterns 
enrollment generally is highest in the fourth quarter  or fall term  although not the case this year  and lowest in the third quarter  or summer term 
in  enrollment by term was as follows enrollment by term term enrollment winter spring summer fall average the following table sets forth our revenues on a quarterly basis for the years ended december   and quarterly revenues dollars in thousands three months ended amount percent amount percent amount percent march june september december total for year costs generally are not affected by the seasonal factors as much as enrollment and revenue  and do not vary significantly on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million at december  at december   most of our excess cash was invested in both taxable and tax exempt money market funds 
on january   we entered into an unsecured new revolving credit facility with maximum amount of borrowings available of million and a three year term 
on april   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement  which is secured by our assets  and provides for a 
table of contents million revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility with a maturity date of march  proceeds from the term loan were used to pay off the million outstanding under the original revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million outstanding under the term loan and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we repaid the million outstanding under the revolving credit facility on january  in  we are obligated to repay million of the term loan 
for the year ended december   we generated million net cash from operating activities compared to million for the same period in capital expenditures were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in capital expenditures for the year ending december  are expected to be in the range of million inclusive of the expected openings of eight new campuses 
in december  we paid million to acquire the operating assets of the jack welch management institute  and received a million payment from mr 
welch representing his economic interest in this program 
for the year ended december   we paid million in regular cash dividends and invested million to repurchase common shares in the open market 
in  we intend to maintain our annual dividend of per share  or per share quarterly 
in  bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue was compared to for the same period in days sales outstanding was days at the end of the fourth quarter compared to days at the end of the fourth quarter currently  we maintain our cash in mostly fdic insured bank accounts and invest our excess cash in money market funds 
following a repayment on january   we have available million under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operating activities  and if necessary  cash borrowed under the credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our requirements for at least the next months 
the table below sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   and cash and marketable securities in millions at december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities short term bond fund total year ended december  investment income 
table of contents contractual obligations the table below sets forth our contractual commitments associated with operating leases and the repayment of debt as of december  payments due by period in thousands total within year years years more than years operating leases line of credit term loan impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of the securities exchange commission regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to the impact of interest rate changes and may be subject to changes in the market values of our future investments 
we invest our excess cash in bank overnight deposits  money market funds and marketable securities 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
earnings from investments in bank overnight deposits  money market mutual funds  and marketable securities may be adversely affected in the future should interest rates decline  although such a decline may reduce the interest rate payable on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair values  or cash flows related to investments in cash equivalents or interest earning marketable securities 
changing interest rates could also have a negative impact on the amount of interest expense we incur 
on april   we entered into a three year amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement providing for a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility 
borrowings under the million revolving credit facility bear interest at libor or a base rate plus a margin ranging from to  depending on our leverage ratio 
also on april   we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement for the million term loan facility that fixes our interest rate on the term loan facility at approximately for the duration of the term loan 
although an increase in libor would not affect interest expense on the term loan  it would affect interest expense on any outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and the fair value of the interest rate swap arrangement 
for every basis points increase in libor  we would incur an incremental million in interest expense per year assuming the entire million revolving credit facility were utilized  but would not materially affect the value of our interest rate swap
