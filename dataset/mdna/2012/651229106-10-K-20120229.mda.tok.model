the largest single capital project in all periods was the implementation of sap  which represented million  million and million of capital expenditures for  and  respectively 
the company purchased noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries for million during during  the company paid million in connection with acquisitions and acquisition related activity 
cash used for restructuring activities is included in changes in accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash used for restructuring activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively  and is included in the cash provided by operating activities 
these payments relate primarily to employee severance  termination benefits and relocation costs 
cash conversion cycle the company defines its cash conversion cycle as the sum of inventory and accounts receivable days outstanding based on cost of products sold and net sales  respectively  for the most recent three month period  including discontinued operations minus accounts payable days outstanding based on cost of products sold for the most recent three month period  including discontinued operations at the end of the year 
the following table depicts the company s cash conversion cycle at december  in number of days accounts receivable inventory accounts payable cash conversion cycle the company s cash conversion cycle is impacted by the seasonality of its businesses and generally tends to be longer in the first and second quarters  based on historical trends  due to inventory build ups early in the year for seasonal sales activity and credit terms provided to customers 
the company s cash conversion cycle at december  approximated its cash conversion cycle at december  and the company has leveraged the implementation of sap in north america to improve working capital  with a focus on reducing the number of days of inventory on hand 
the improvement in days of inventory on hand over the period from to was offset by an inventory build up in late in advance of the sap go live in the european region planned for the first half of and increased safety stocks in north america related to the planned closure of the greenville  texas manufacturing facility 
financial position the company is committed to maintaining a strong financial position through maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity  managing working capital  and monitoring the company s overall capitalization 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  and the company had million and million of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and receivables facility  respectively 
working capital at december  was million compared to million at december   and the current ratio at december  was compared to at december  the increase in working capital and the current ratio is primarily attributable to a higher cash balance and lower accrued compensation  partially offset by higher combined levels of short term and current portion of long term debt 
the company monitors its overall capitalization by evaluating total debt to total capitalization 
total debt to total capitalization is defined as the sum of short and long term debt  less cash  divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders equity  less cash 
total debt to total capitalization was and at december  and december   respectively 
over the long term  the company plans to improve its current ratio and total debt to total capitalization by improving operating results  managing working capital and using cash generated from operations to repay outstanding debt 
the company has from time to time refinanced  redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its overall financial position and balance sheet 
going forward  depending on market conditions  its cash positions and other considerations  the company may continue to take such actions 
borrowing arrangements in december  the company entered into a five year credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement provides for an unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility with a maturity date of december   and an aggregate commitment at any time outstanding of up to million the facility 
the facility provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper and accordingly  commercial paper may be issued only up to the amount available for borrowing under the facility 
the facility also provides for the issuance of up to million of letters of credit  so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings or standby letters of credit issued or outstanding under the facility  and there was no commercial paper outstanding 
concurrent with the company s entry into the credit agreement  the company terminated its million syndicated revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in november in addition to the committed portion of the facility  the credit agreement provides for extensions of competitive bid loans from one or more lenders at the lenders discretion of up to million  which are not a utilization of the amount available for borrowing under the facility 
in september  the company renewed its day receivables financing facility that provides for maximum borrowings of up to million such that it will expire in september as of december   aggregate borrowings of million were outstanding under the facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
the following table presents the maximum and average daily borrowings outstanding under the company s short term borrowing arrangements during the years ended december  in millions short term borrowing arrangement maximum average maximum average commercial paper receivables financing facility the indentures governing the company s medium term notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants 
the company s borrowing arrangements other than the medium term notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants  including minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to total capitalization ratios 
as defined by the agreements governing the borrowing arrangements  minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods 
generally  maximum debt to total capitalization is calculated as the sum of short term and long term debt  excluding the junior convertible subordinated debentures  divided by the sum of i total debt  ii total stockholders equity and iii a specified dollar amount ranging from million to million related to impairment charges incurred by the company 
as of december   the company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements  and the company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the facility and the receivables facility and utilize the million for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debt to total capitalization limits in its financial covenants 
a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the company s ability to borrow under the facility and the receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness 

table of contents debt the company has varying needs for short term working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business 
the volume and timing of production impacts the company s cash flows and has historically involved increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year 
working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through short term financing arrangements  such as commercial paper or borrowings under the facility or receivables facility 
as of december   the current portion of long term debt and short term debt totaled million  including million of borrowings under the receivables facility and million principal amount of the medium term notes due march the company plans to repay these amounts as they come due using short term borrowings  and the company expects to use cash flows from operations generated in the second half of to repay such short term borrowings 
total debt was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
total debt decreased million primarily due to the repayment of the remaining million outstanding principal amount of the term loan and no commercial paper outstanding at december  compared to million of commercial paper outstanding at december  additionally  the company extinguished an additional million principal amount of convertible notes in exchange for total consideration of million  consisting of million shares of the company s common stock and cash of million 
the following table presents the average outstanding debt and weighted average interest rates for the years ended december  in millions  except percentages average outstanding debt average interest rate the average interest rate includes the impacts of fixed for floating interest rate swaps 
the company s floating rate debt  which includes medium term notes that are subject to fixed for floating interest rate swaps  was and of total debt as of december  and  respectively 
the reduction in floating rate debt is primarily due to the termination and settlement of fixed for floating interest rate swaps relating to million principal amount of medium term notes with original maturity dates ranging between march and april and the repayment of million remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan during see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
pension and other postretirement plan obligations the company sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries 
the company s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets as well as the interest rate environment 
in and  the company made cash contributions of million and million  respectively  to its primary us defined benefit pension plan 
the company expects to contribute approximately million to its worldwide pension and other postretirement plans in based primarily on minimum contribution requirements 
future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
the company determines its plan asset investment mix  in part  on the duration of each plan s liabilities 
to the extent each plan s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company or to the extent the pension liabilities increase due to declines in interest rates or otherwise  the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate 
dividends the company s board of directors approved a increase in the quarterly dividend from per share to per share  effective with the quarterly dividend paid in june the company intends to maintain dividends at a level such that operating cash flows can be used to repay outstanding debt and improve its investment grade credit rating 
the payment of dividends to holders of the company s common stock remains at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the company s financial condition  earnings  legal requirements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
share repurchase program in august  the company announced a million share repurchase program the srp 
under the srp  the company 
table of contents may repurchase its own shares of common stock through a combination of a b automatic trading plan  discretionary market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions 
the srp is authorized to run for a period of three years ending in august during  the company repurchased million shares pursuant to the srp for million  and such shares were immediately retired 
the repurchase of additional shares will depend upon many factors  including the company s financial condition  liquidity and legal requirements 
credit ratings the company s credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies 
the company s current senior and short term debt credit ratings from three credit rating agencies are listed below senior debt credit rating short term debt credit rating outlook moody s investors service baa p stable standard poor s bbb a stable fitch ratings bbb f stable outlook for the year ending december   the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of to million after restructuring and restructuring related cash payments of to million 
the company plans to fund capital expenditures of approximately to million  which include expenditures associated with the implementation of sap in europe 
overall  the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents  cash flows generated from future operations  access to capital markets  and availability under the facility and receivables facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses 
the company plans to use available cash  borrowing capacity  cash flows from future operations and alternative financing arrangements to repay debt maturities as they come due  including short term debt of million  primarily representing borrowings under the receivables facility  and million principal amount of medium term notes due march resolution of income tax contingencies in  and  the company recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters 
these benefits are reflected in the company s  and consolidated statements of operations 
the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different than that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals  which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through certain other items  such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the indicated period 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of december  additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years debt interest on debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due  excluding interest  based on borrowings outstanding as of december  for further information relating to these obligations  see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding as of december   excluding the impact of interest rate swaps that adjust the fixed rate to a floating rate for million of medium term notes 
interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect as of december  for further information  see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of december  for further information relating to these obligations  see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of december  for finished goods  raw materials  components and services pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations  which include all significant terms 
total does not include contractual obligations reported on the december  balance sheet as current liabilities  except for current portion of long term debt and short term debt 
the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits 
as a large taxpayer  the company is under audit from time to time by the irs and other taxing authorities  and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year 
while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the million in unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  at december  is excluded from the preceding table 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
additionally  the company has obligations with respect to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans  which are excluded from the preceding table 
the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets  among other factors 
as of december   the company had liabilities of million related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans for which the company expects to make contributions of million in see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   the company had million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company s self insurance programs  including workers compensation  product liability and medical 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   the company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in that footnote  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe the company s critical accounting policies 
sales recognition sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer  which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms 
sales are net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts  cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts 
recovery of accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
accounts are reviewed for potential write off on a case by case basis 
accounts deemed uncollectible are written off  net of expected recoveries 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 

table of contents inventory reserves the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  including shrink reserves  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and are included in cost of products sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level  and all of the company s goodwill is assigned to the company s reporting units 
reporting units  which are referred to as the company s global business units gbu  are one level below the operating segment level 
the gbu is the company s core organizing concept  and each gbu supports one or more of the company s key brands worldwide 
the company has not had any material changes to the reporting units identified and used to test goodwill for impairment since january  due to restructuring activities or otherwise 
acquired businesses  if any  including goodwill arising from such transactions  are integrated into the company s existing reporting units 
the company had reporting units with total goodwill of billion as of july   prior to the completion of its annual impairment testing 
five of the company s reporting units accounted for approximately percent of the company s total goodwill 
these five reporting units were as follows baby parenting  rubbermaid commercial products  industrial products services  markers  highlighters  art office organization  and technology 
the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process 
the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
for example  if macroeconomic factors  such as consumer demand and consumer confidence  deteriorate materially such that the company s reporting units projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates  the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired 
other than the annual impairment test  the company determined that no tests of impairment were necessary during in the company s goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value  impairment may be present 
estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded 
the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing  each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value 
for the company s reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows  the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value 
the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the company s internal forecasting process 
to determine the ebitda multiple  the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses 
the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the company s market capitalization plus an equity control premium 
the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to the company s market value  with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company 
the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 
the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from to in using the ebitda multiples  the company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the company s total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium 
the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit  including the reporting unit s market position  brand awareness  gross and operating margins  and prospects for growth  among other factors 
after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units  no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used 
furthermore  the company s equity market value at july  of approximately billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately billion 
for the impairment test as of july   if each reporting unit s ebitda multiple were reduced by from the to multiple used for each reporting unit  all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

table of contents the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances  such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned  is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market  has experienced significant losses  is in a stage of hyper growth  is executing significant restructuring efforts  or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies 
the company used the discounted cash flow approach to value the baby parenting and hardware reporting units for the annual impairment test as of july  the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit  the discount rate  and the working capital investment required 
estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates  raw material and sourced product costs  currency fluctuations  and operating efficiencies to be realized 
the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit 
in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the baby parenting and hardware reporting units in  the company generally used average compound long term sales growth rates of to  average operating margins of to  and discount rates ranging from to 
the company concluded that the baby parenting and hardware reporting units did not pass step one of the goodwill impairment test based on the values determined using the discounted cash flow approach 
when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the company measures the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill step two 
the company identifies unrecognized intangible assets  such as trade names and customer relationships  and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting unit s recognized and unrecognized intangible assets 
the estimated values of the reporting unit s intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting unit s total fair value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on the results of step one tests performed for each reporting unit as of july   the company determined that step two tests were required for the baby parenting and hardware reporting units 
the company determined goodwill at its baby parenting and hardware reporting units was impaired using the discounted cash flow approach in step two of the goodwill impairment test 
the impairments generally resulted from declines in sales projections relative to previous estimates due to economic and market factors based in large part on actual declines in sales in the first half of  which adversely impacted projected operating margins and net cash flows for these reporting units 
the decline in anticipated future cash flows adversely affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units and resulted in the estimated fair value of the baby parenting and hardware reporting units being less than their net assets including goodwill 
the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million for the baby parenting and hardware reporting units  respectively 
the company s baby parenting reporting unit had million of goodwill remaining at december   and the company s hardware reporting unit had no goodwill remaining at december  with respect to the discounted cash flow analysis used to determine the estimated fair value of the baby parenting reporting unit  if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the baby parenting reporting unit decreased basis points  the estimated value of the reporting unit would have increased million 
as a result  the baby parenting reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test and  therefore  the company would not have recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the baby parenting reporting unit in if the discount rate increased basis points  the estimated fair value of the baby parenting reporting unit would have declined by approximately million  which would have resulted in additional impairment charges recorded during for the baby parenting reporting unit 
in step two of the goodwill impairment test for the baby parenting reporting unit  the company estimated the value of the baby parenting trade names using a discounted cash flow model using the relief from royalty method  which requires an estimate of royalties that could be derived in the future use of the assets were the company to license the use of the trade names 
if the estimated value assigned to the trade names increases  the implied fair value of the goodwill decreases and results in a greater impairment charge  and if the estimated value assigned to the trade names decreases  the implied fair value of the goodwill increases and results in a lower impairment charge 
in valuing the trade names  the company generally used estimated royalty rates ranging from to of net sales 
if the royalty rates used to estimate the value of trade names increased decreased basis points  the value of the baby parenting trade names would have increased decreased million and would have resulted in million more less goodwill impairment 
if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the hardware reporting unit decreased basis points  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have increased million 
however  although the hardware reporting unit would still not have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test  the goodwill impairment charge recorded in would have been reduced 
if the discount rate for the hardware reporting unit increased basis points  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have declined  however  the goodwill impairment charge recorded during for the hardware reporting unit would not have changed since all of the hardware goodwill was included in the goodwill impairment charge 
other than the two reporting units for which goodwill impairment charges were recorded  the company has no reporting units whose estimated fair values at july  exceeded net assets by less than of the reporting unit s net assets 

table of contents the company s indefinite lived intangible assets totaled million as of july  the company assesses the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model using the relief from royalty method  which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trademark or trade name 
an impairment charge for indefinite lived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 
the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets as of july  and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million relating to a trade name in the baby parenting reporting unit 
the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date  such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name 
based on consideration of these factors  the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present  and therefore  impairment testing as of a date other than july  was not required during the company had reporting units with total goodwill of billion as of december   after the completion of its annual impairment testing 
five of the company s reporting units accounted for approximately percent of the company s total goodwill 
these five reporting units were as follows rubbermaid commercial products  industrial products services  everyday writing  markers  highlighters  art office organization  and technology 
the company also had million of indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company s customer base and net sales  a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers  or sustained declines in the company s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity 
the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors  which could result in impairment charges in the future 
although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur  if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels  it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 
capitalized software costs the company capitalizes costs associated with internal use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development 
capitalized internal use software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software  ii payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project  and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software 
capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose 
the company expenses as incurred research and development  general and administrative  and indirect costs associated with internal use software 
in addition  the company expenses as incurred training  maintenance and other internal use software costs incurred during the post implementation stage 
costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal use software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software 
the company capitalized million of software costs during  which primarily relate to employee  consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of sap at the company s d cor gbu and the european region 
capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were million at december  capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december  the company amortizes internal use software costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  which typically ranges from three to years 
capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment  including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used 
impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 
other long lived assets the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present 
these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
if impairment indicators are present  the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets 
the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount 
the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  working capital  and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company s strategic plan 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  the company discounts 
table of contents the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
generally  the company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level  as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 
product liability reserves the company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance 
the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods  review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves 
the company s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company s product liability reserve 
the company has product liability reserves of million as of december  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company  and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
legal and environmental reserves the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations  as well as contract and other disputes 
the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters 
the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes  except with respect to long term operations and maintenance  comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability cercla and other matters which are estimated at present value 
the company s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december  ranged between million and million 
as of december   the company had a reserve of million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate  which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance  the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries  as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 
the company s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities 
although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken  which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
for uncertain tax positions  the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance  which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
the company s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
pensions and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increases  as discussed below discount rates the company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated 
table of contents with bond coupons and maturities 
health care cost trend rate the company s health care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data  near term health care outlook  and industry benchmarks and surveys 
expected return on plan assets the company s expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and historical and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes 
the company s analysis gives consideration to historical returns and long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience 
rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increases reflects the company s long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense
