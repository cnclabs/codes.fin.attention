promotional expenses are recorded as a reduction of net sales in the consolidated statements of income 
sow costs represent a significant component of the foods segment cost of sales  and the volatile nature of sow costs greatly impacts the profitability of the segment 
the increase in sow costs from per hundredweight to per hundredweight  resulted in a cost of sales increase of million in fiscal  and is the primary reason for the increase in the cost of sales ratio from percent to percent in fiscal the foods segment experienced a decrease in operating income of million  or percent  in fiscal compared to a year ago  and its operating income margin decreased from percent of net sales in fiscal to percent of net sales in fiscal the decrease in operating income is primarily due to the increases in sow costs and promotional expenses  partially offset by a decrease in pretax severance charges of million compared to fiscal we are focused on delivering top line growth in the foods segment

in fiscal  we completed farm fresh refreshes at bob evans restaurants 
the farm fresh refresh initiative added a new sales layer  bakery to existing restaurants 
we believe that improvement in same store sales experienced at refreshed bob evans restaurants is due to the enhanced appearance of the restaurants from the farm fresh refresh initiative and the new bakery case 
in addition to investing capital in our farm fresh refresh program to enhance the on premise dining experience  we continue to drive net sales through new menu offerings aimed at both value and quality for our guests 
we continue to offer meals under six dollars with a cent add on 
we introduced our endless farmhouse lunch that offers guests unlimited servings of salad  soup and bread and for an additional  guests can enjoy endless servings of salad  soup and bread for dinner and on weekends 
we also introduced three course dinners that offer quality food aimed at improving sales at our evening day part and raising the average guest check 
we believe these value offerings will continue to promote bob evans restaurants as a value priced on premise dining choice 
during fiscal  bob evans restaurants opened four new restaurants including the first in arkansas 
we expect new restaurants will play an increasingly important role in our expected sales increases 
mimi s caf experienced negative same store sales comparisons in fiscal we have seen sequential quarterly improvement in comparison during fiscal and in comparison to fiscal the same store sales improvements are the result of value messaging  convenience  focus on improving off premise sales and cause related marketing efforts 
mimi s caf introduced programs such as wine flights  caf express to go  happiest hour  family meals to go and the go red for women marketing campaign 
the express lunch platform  wine flights  the added off premise dining options and marketing programs aimed at a target audience has led to the improvement in same store sales 
we are looking into strategies to continue the same store sales improvement and drive overall top line performance  by initiating a refresh program at mimi s caf and implementing a similar three course meal strategy for the evening day part 
mimi s caf plans to leverage off of bob evans restaurants successes by using these programs to improve the guests dining experiences 
the foods segment s net sales decreased million  or percent  in fiscal versus fiscal while total pounds sold were almost flat  promotional expenses increased million compared to fiscal  as we protected our market share in the face of increased competitive pressure 
promotional expenses are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
sow costs increased from per hundredweight to per hundredweight  increasing cost of sales by million in fiscal we believe initiatives such as expansion of distribution  product in sourcing and new product innovations will enable future top line growth 
we believe there are opportunities to increase product volume by utilizing our foods segment as a resource to deliver products to both bob evans restaurants and mimi s caf 
the insourcing relationship not only benefits the foods segment through potential increases in total pounds sold  it also offers consistency to our guests  reduces product preparation and insulates bob evans restaurants and mimi s caf from arbitrary price increases from outside suppliers 
efficiencies gained as a result of our lean manufacturing initiatives  have enabled us to focus on product innovation in the side dish and frozen categories 
these categories are successful and growing because customers want value  quality and ease of preparation for their busy lifestyles 
we saw the success of side dish innovation in our launch of seasonal sides during the holiday season 
we have additional major side dish and frozen product introductions planned for the summer that will expand our offerings beyond our core products 
as we continue to see success in our side dish and frozen categories  we also continue to build upon our sausage category 
we have completed an every day low pricing  program with a large account aimed at putting more of our products on their shelves 
additionally  we have been expanding our ready to eat sausage products which include both pork and turkey offerings 
we have seen our ready to eat sales grow by more than percent over the past year 
on may   we announced an additional phase to our plant optimization initiatives with the plan to close our ready to eat manufacturing plant in bidwell  ohio and our soup and gravy manufacturing plant in springfield  ohio early in fiscal we will consolidate the volume in sulphur springs  texas where we will expand the current facility by more than fifty thousand square feet 
the expanded facility will increase productivity and offer new product opportunities with the ability to process multiple types of proteins 
we believe our plans for product innovation and the upgraded production facility positions the foods segment for future growth

the increase in promotional expenses did not provide a lift to net sales  but instead further reduced net sales  causing deleverage in the cost of sales ratio 
our ongoing lean manufacturing initiatives  plant optimization activities and execution of future inorganic growth strategies take on a more critical role to offset rising sow costs and competitive pressures 
the fiscal sow cost average represented a percent increase compared to fiscal  and the fiscal average represented a percent increase compared to fiscal the fiscal increase in sow costs was more than offset by both the significant decrease in promotional expenses and price increases on retail products

the fiscal decrease in the operating wages ratio compared to fiscal was primarily due to headcount reductions resulting from our lean manufacturing productivity initiatives  including the closure of the galva  illinois  fresh sausage manufacturing facility and our fresh sausage operations in bidwell  ohio 
our goal is to provide health insurance as efficiently and inexpensively as possible 
however given the current regulatory environment it is not clear if the over all health care costs that we have experienced will continue 
we plan to leverage our food facilities to produce products sold in our restaurants 
these synergies between bob evans restaurants  mimi s and the foods segment  as discussed in the net sales section above  should result in reducing our labor costs within our restaurants

the fiscal d a ratio declined as a result of the sale of the dc in the second quarter to an unrelated third party company 
the fiscal increase as a percentage of net sales compared with fiscal  is due to the increased fiscal capital expenditures and relatively stable food products net sales 
we expect d a to increase  in fiscal and beyond  as a result of our expansion of the sulphur springs  texas  facility and other capital spending 
interest net interest expense was as follows in thousands gross interest expense fixed rate debt variable rate debt capitalized interest gross interest income net interest expense the decrease in net interest expense in fiscal was the result of lower average borrowings in fiscal compared to fiscal we reduced our total debt position by million in fiscal the increase in capitalized interest due to increased capital projects in process  primarily the new corporate campus  had the effect of lowering reported interest expense 
partially offsetting the effect of lower average borrowings were costs incurred with the new revolving credit facility

the primary purposes of the credit facility are for trade and stand by letters of credit in the ordinary course of business as well as working capital  refinancing of existing indebtedness if any  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments  and other general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is intended to provide liquidity options and to support our primary growth and return initiatives 
the credit facility extends over a period of five years and requires us to pay interest on outstanding borrowings at a rate based on london interbank offered rate libor or the base rate plus a margin based on our leverage ratio  ranging from to per annum for libor  and ranging from to per annum for the base rate

future payments of our contractual obligations and outstanding indebtedness as of april   are as follows contractual obligations total year and less years years after years operating leases long term debt purchase obligations the provisions of our deferred compensation plans do not provide for specific payment dates 
therefore  our obligations under these plans were excluded from this table 
our deferred compensation obligations of million were included in the consolidated balance sheets at april   as part of long term liabilities

we expect margin pressure from increasing commodity costs  offset by the benefit of our actual versus theoretical food cost program  increased sales of higher margin items  effective supply chain management and improving operating wages through expected labor efficiencies 
in the foods segment  we expect overall net sales of to million for the full fiscal year  driven by new product introductions and distribution gains in both retail and food service 
we anticipate that sow costs will average approximately to per hundredweight in fiscal for the full year 
we expect the foods segment s fiscal operating income margin to be approximately to

a change in market interest rates will not impact interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt 
we purchase certain commodities such as beef  pork  poultry  seafood  produce and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with suppliers 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that fix the price paid for certain commodities 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and most commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature
