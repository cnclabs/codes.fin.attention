at the core of our software and services are our proprietary databases  which are localized to each geographical market we serve 
our insurance claims processing software and services are typically integrated into our customers systems  operations and processes  making it costly and time consuming to switch to another provider 
this customer integration  along with our long standing customer relationships  has contributed to our very high customer retention rate 
segments we have aggregated our operating segments into two reportable segments emea and americas 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we announced the formation of the netherlands  germany  austria and switzerland ngas region to leverage the operational and technological achievements and investments we made in the highly established markets initiative hemi region across our markets 
as a result of the creation of the ngas region  in the first quarter of fiscal year we transferred our netherlands operating segment from our americas reportable segment to our emea reportable segment 
accordingly  our emea reportable segment encompasses our operations in europe  the middle east  africa  asia and australia  while our americas reportable segment encompasses our operations in north  central and south america 
all prior period segment information has been restated to conform to the current presentation 
our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer 
we evaluate the performance of our reportable segments based on revenues  income before provision for income taxes and adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure that represents gaap net income excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  restructuring charges  asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities  acquisition and related costs  litigation related expenses and other income expense  net 
we do not allocate certain costs to reportable segments  including costs related to our financing activities  business development and oversight  and tax  audit and other professional fees  to our reportable segments 
instead  we manage these costs at the corporate level 
the table below sets forth our revenues by reportable segment and as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated dollars in millions fiscal years ended june  emea americas total for fiscal year  the united states  the united kingdom and germany were the only countries that individually represented more than of total revenues 
components of revenues and expenses revenues 
table of contents we generate revenues from the sale of software and services to our customers pursuant to negotiated contracts or pricing agreements 
pricing for our software and services is set forth in these agreements and negotiated with each customer 
we generally bill our customers monthly under one or more of the following bases price per transaction  fixed monthly amount for a prescribed number of transactions  fixed monthly subscription rate  price per set of services rendered  and price per system delivered 
our software and services are often sold as packages  without individual pricing for each component 
our revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances  which we estimate based on both our examination of a subset of customer accounts and historical experience 
our core offering is our estimating and workflow software  which is used by our insurance company  collision repair facility and independent assessor customers  representing the majority of our revenues 
our salvage and recycling software  business intelligence and consulting services  vehicle data validation  salvage disposition  driver violation reporting services and other offerings represent in the aggregate a smaller portion of our revenues 
we believe that our estimating and workflow software will continue to represent the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future

restructuring charges  asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities restructuring charges  asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities primarily represent costs incurred in relation to our restructuring initiatives 
restructuring charges primarily include employee termination benefits charges and charges related to the lease and vendor contract liabilities that we do not expect to provide future economic 
table of contents benefits due to the implementation of our restructuring initiatives 
acquisition and related costs acquisition and related costs include legal and other professional fees and other transaction costs associated with completed and contemplated business combinations and asset acquisitions  costs associated with integrating acquired businesses  including costs incurred to eliminate workforce redundancies and for product rebranding  and other charges incurred as a direct result of our acquisition efforts

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests several of our customers and other entities own noncontrolling interests in seven of our operating subsidiaries 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflect such owners proportionate interest in the earnings of such operating subsidiaries 
factors affecting our operating results below is a summary description of several external factors that have or may have an effect on our operating results 
foreign currency 
during fiscal years  and  we generated approximately  and of our revenues  respectively  and incurred a majority of our costs  in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period for our consolidated statement of income and certain components of stockholders equity and the exchange rate at the end of that period for the consolidated balance sheet 
these translations resulted in foreign currency translation adjustments of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income were million  million  million during fiscal years   and  respectively 
exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate 
the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in euros  pound sterling  swiss francs  canadian dollars and other foreign currencies 
the following table provides the average quarterly exchange rates for the euro and pound sterling since the beginning of fiscal year 
table of contents period average euro to us dollar exchange rate average pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  the us dollar strengthened against most major foreign currencies we use to transact our business 
the average us dollar strengthened versus the euro by and the pound sterling by  which decreased our revenues and expenses during fiscal year a hypothetical increase or decrease in the us dollar versus other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to our revenues of million during fiscal year in april  in order to hedge our exposure to variability in the euro denominated cash flows associated with two intercompany loans  we entered into two pay fixed euros received fixed us dollar cross currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of million 
these cross currency swaps were designated  at inception  as cash flow hedges of the intercompany loans 
accordingly  any foreign exchange gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income resulting from the periodic re measurement of the intercompany loans into us dollars is mitigated by an offsetting gain or loss  as the case may be  resulting from the change in the fair value of the swaps 
factors that affect business volume 
the following external factors have or may have an effect on the number of claims that are submitted and or our volume of transactions  any of which can affect our revenues number of insurance claims made 
in fiscal year  the number of insurance claims made increased slightly versus fiscal year however  in several of our large western european markets  the number of insurance claims for vehicle damage submitted by owners to their insurance carriers declined slightly 
the number of insurance claims made can be influenced by factors such as unemployment levels  the number of miles driven  rising gasoline prices  the number of uninsured drivers  rising insurance premiums and insured opting for lower coverage or higher deductible levels  among other things 
fewer claims made can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
sales of new and used vehicles 
according to industry sources  new vehicle sales fell in   and in markets wherein automobile insurance is generally government mandated and claims processing is automated advanced markets 
sales in these markets are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate through at the same time  in other markets  sales continued to grow from through  and are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate through fewer new light vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the road and fewer automobile accidents  which can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
damaged vehicle repair costs 
the cost to repair damaged vehicles  also known as severity  includes labor  parts and other related costs 
severity has steadily risen for a number of years 
according to the insurance information institute  from through  the price index for body work has increased by compared with a increase in the general cost of living index 
insurance companies purchase our products and services to help standardize the cost of repair 
should the cost of labor  parts and other related items continue to increase over time  insurance companies may seek to purchase and utilize an increasing number of our products and services to help improve the standardization of the cost of repair 
penetration rate of vehicle insurance 
an increasing rate of procuring vehicle insurance will result in an increase in the number of insurance claims made for damaged vehicles 
an increasing number of insurance claims submitted can increase the transaction based fees that we generate for partial loss and total loss estimates 
this is due in part to both increased regulation and increased use of financing in the purchase of new and used vehicles 
we expect that the rate of vehicle insurance in our less mature international markets will continue to increase during the next eighteen months 

table of contents automobile usage number of miles driven 
several factors can influence miles driven including gasoline prices and economic conditions 
for calendar year  cumulative miles driven in the united states declined by compared to the same period in the prior year 
fewer miles driven can result in fewer automobile accidents  which can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
seasonality 
our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations 
in particular  we have historically experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter and fourth quarter during each fiscal year 
this seasonality is caused primarily by more days of inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets  which contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods 
in addition  our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other factors  including the occurrence of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain public holidays 
for example  the easter holiday occurs during the third quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years  resulting in a change in the number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs 
non cash share based compensation charges 
we incurred pre tax  non cash share based compensation charges of million  million and million during fiscal years   and  respectively 
at june   the estimated total remaining unamortized share based compensation expense  net of forfeitures  was million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
restructuring charges 
we have incurred restructuring charges in each period presented and also expect to incur additional restructuring charges  primarily relating to severance costs  over the next several quarters as we work to improve efficiencies in our business 
we do not expect reduced revenues or an increase in other expenses as a result of continued implementation of our restructuring initiatives 
other factors 
other factors that have or may have an effect on our operating results include gain and loss of customers  pricing pressures  acquisitions  joint ventures or similar transactions  expenses to develop new software or services  and expenses and restrictions related to indebtedness 
we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in recent years 
results of operations our results of operations include the results of operations of acquired companies from the date of the respective acquisitions

fiscal year and fiscal year vs 
fiscal year during fiscal years  and  we recorded an income tax provision benefit of million  million and million  respectively  which resulted in an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate on a period to period basis is primarily attributable to the release of million of the valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets during fiscal year we released million of the million valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets during fiscal year the release of the valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets was the result of our sustained history of operating profitability and the determination by management that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was judged to be more likely than not 
we exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the 
table of contents recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
if judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets change in future periods  we could be required to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets prior to expiration 
factors that impact our income tax provision include  but are not limited to  the mix of jurisdictional earnings and varying jurisdictional income tax rates  establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions  permanent differences resulting from the book and tax treatment of certain items  and discrete items 
future changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate

in june  we issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of million collectively with the senior unsecured notes issued in april  the senior notes  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in june were used to acquire explore 
in april  we issued additional senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the senior notes issued in april were issued at an original issue price of plus accrued interest from december   resulting in net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in april were used to repay approximately million of the outstanding term loans under our existing senior credit facility held by lenders that did not elect to extend their loans  and we intend to use the remainder of such net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including strategic initiatives such as future acquisitions  joint ventures  investments or other business development opportunities

at any time on or after june   we may redeem the senior notes at the following redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  through the date of redemption i if the redemption occurs on or after june  but prior to june   the redemption price is of the principal amount of the notes redeemed  ii if the redemption occurs on or after june  but prior to june   the redemption price is of the principal amount of the notes redeemed  and iii if the redemption occurs on or after june   the redemption price is of the principal amount of the notes redeemed 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  we are required to offer to redeem the senior notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  through the redemption date 

table of contents the senior notes contain certain covenants including  among others  restrictions related to dividends  distributions  repurchases of equity  prepayments of debt or additional indebtedness  investments  liens on assets  mergers with another company  dispositions of assets  and transactions with affiliates 
we are in compliance with the specified financial covenants of the senior notes at june  in april  we entered into an amended and restated first lien credit and guaranty agreement the amended credit facility  which amended and restated the amended and restated first lien credit and guaranty agreement  dated as of may  the amended credit facility consists of a us term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million and european term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
the maturity date for all of the term loans is may  as of june   we had million and million million in outstanding loans under the us term loan and european term loan  respectively 
currently  the us term loan bears interest at month libor plus a margin at june  and the european term loans bear interest at month euribor plus a margin at june  
interest is payable quarterly 
the amended credit facility contains a leverage ratio  which is applicable only if specified minimum borrowings are outstanding during a quarter 
in addition  the amended credit facility contains covenants restricting us from undertaking specified corporate actions  including but not limited to asset dispositions  acquisitions  payment of dividends and other specified payments  changes of control  incurrence of indebtedness  capital expenditures  creation of liens  making loans and investments and transactions with affiliates 
we are in compliance with the specified financial covenants of the amended credit facility at june  the amended credit facility provides us with the ability to add up to million of incremental revolving loans 
on july   we established a committed incremental revolving credit facility of million with a group of banks 
in order to mitigate the variability of the euro denominated cash flows associated with two intercompany loans  in april  we entered into two pay fixed euros received fixed us dollar cross currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of million 
in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility associated with our usd and euro denominated term loans  in august  we entered into two pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the maturity date of both swaps is may  which coincides with the maturity of our usd and euro denominated term loans and bear an interest rate of 
plus a margin for the us dollar denominated swap and 
plus a margin for the euro denominated swap 
both swaps will become effective as of september  pursuant to agreements entered into prior to the csg acquisition  the noncontrolling stockholders of certain of our majority owned subsidiaries have the right to require us to redeem their shares at the then fair market value 
we do not have any indication that the exercise any remaining redemption rights is probable within the next twelve months 
further  we do not believe the occurrence of conditions precedent to the exercise of certain of these redemption rights is probable within the next twelve months 
if the stockholders exercised their redemption rights  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund such redemptions 
the remaining noncontrolling ownership interest in our majority owned autoonline subsidiary is subject to a put call option 
the option may be exercised by any party beginning in fiscal year at a redemption value equal to ten times autoonline s consolidated ebitda for the fiscal year ended prior to the exercise date  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
in december  we acquired a minority ownership interest in digidentity bv  a dutch company that is a leading provider of next generation e identification certificates for authentication of online identities 
pursuant to the terms of the acquisition  the majority owners of digidentity may put their shares to us through fiscal year if digidentity achieves certain financial performance targets 
the purchase price of the shares is calculated based on a multiple of digidentity s actual versus target earnings before interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization for the twelve month period ended prior to the exercise date 
in november  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to a total of million of our common stock through november  share repurchases are made from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase program does not require us to purchase any specific number or amount of shares  and the timing and amount of such purchases will be determined by management based 
table of contents upon market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the program may be amended or terminated at the discretion of our board of directors 
through june   we have repurchased approximately million shares for million 
in fiscal year  we paid quarterly cash dividends with a value of per outstanding share of common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit to our stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record 
the aggregate dividend payments for fiscal year were million 
on august   we announced that our board of directors approved the payment of a cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit 
the board of directors also approved a quarterly stock dividend equivalent of per outstanding restricted stock unit granted to certain of our executive officers during fiscal years and in lieu of the cash dividend  which dividend equivalent will be paid to the restricted stock unit holders as the restricted stock unit vests 
the dividends are payable on september  to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record at the close of business on september  any determination to pay dividends in future periods will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
the indenture governing the senior notes and the amended credit facility include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
as of june  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
at june   our total current and long term debt obligations were billion  consisting of million related to the senior notes due in june  and million related to the amended credit facility due in may we believe that our existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital  capital spending and debt service requirements  as well as acquisition and strategic opportunities  for at least the next twelve months 
our management believes that our cash is best utilized by investing in the future growth of our business  either through penetration of new geographic markets or acquisitions and other strategic opportunities  and maximizing stockholder return through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases 
we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities  which may require additional debt or equity financing 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our then existing stockholders may result 
additional debt financing may include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any equity or debt financing may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of june  to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no us income taxes have been provided thereon 
at june   the amount of cash associated with permanently reinvested foreign earnings was approximately million 
during fiscal years and  we completed non recurring repatriations of foreign earnings to the us of approximately million of which approximately million was treated as return of basis for tax reporting purposes and million  respectively 
the purpose of the repatriation in fiscal year was to fund our acquisition of explore 
the purpose of the repatriation in fiscal year was to realize significant us income tax benefits in the form of foreign tax credits which would have been substantially diluted if not realized in fiscal year we have not  nor do we anticipate the need to  repatriate funds to the us in order to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business  including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 
if we were to repatriate such foreign earnings in the future  we would incur incremental us federal and state income taxes 
however  our intent is to continue to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate foreign earnings to fund our us operations 
the following summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in the periods presented fiscal years ended june  amount changed from to to in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in net income  after considering non cash adjustments  of million  the operating cash flows generated by explore  acquired in june  and changes in working capital 
investing activities 
the million of cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily attributable to capital expenditures and business combinations and asset acquisitions 
the million of cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the million paid to acquire explore in june as well as capital 
table of contents expenditures 
financing activities 
the million of cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily attributable to repayments of long term debt of million  repurchases of common stock of million and dividends paid to shareholders of million  offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in april of million 
the million of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in june of million 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our cash contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations contingent purchase consideration purchase obligations lease obligations total represents principal and interest payments for the senior notes and our outstanding term loans under the amended credit facility 
for purposes of the table above  we calculated the interest payments on our outstanding term loans under the amended credit facility assuming that the interest rate in effect on the term loans at june  would remain fixed through maturity 
amount excludes the premium on the senior notes issued in april  which was million as of june  represents potential future contingent cash consideration associated with business combinations and asset acquisitions as of june  contingent future cash payments related to acquisitions completed after june  are accrued at fair value as of the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value at each reporting date 
we determined the fair value of future contingent purchase consideration related to acquisitions completed after june  based on the weighted probabilities of potential future payments 
the amount and timing of future payments are based on the achievement of specific targets 
lease obligations include operating and capital leases and are net of sublease income 
in addition to the contractual obligations identified in the preceding table  the noncontrolling owners of certain of our majority owned subsidiaries have the right to require us to redeem their shares at the then fair market value 
as of june   we estimate that the aggregate fair value of these redeemable noncontrolling interests was approximately million 
the redemption of these noncontrolling interests by these noncontrolling owners is not within our control and the timing is uncertain 
excluded from the table above is a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of june  the timing and amount of the future cash flows related to this liability is uncertain and cannot be practically determined 
off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions as of june   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
certain minority stockholders of our international subsidiaries are also commercial purchasers and users of our software and services 
revenue transactions with all of the minority stockholders in the aggregate were less than of our consolidated revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively  and aggregate accounts receivable from the noncontrolling stockholders represent less than of consolidated accounts receivable at june  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
table of contents our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  which may be affected by our estimates and assumptions  are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
impairment indicators arise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable  such as a significant downturn in industry or economic trends with a direct impact on the business  an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of for less than the carrying value  loss of key personnel  or a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group 
we test goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the potential impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units through an income approach  utilizing a discounted cash flow model  and a market approach  which considers comparable companies and transactions 
under the income approach  the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
alternatively  the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period 
under the market approach  fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit 
the multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions  discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size  diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions 
in our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year  we concluded that the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned exceeded their respective carrying values  accordingly  we did not identify any goodwill impairment 
although we considered the fair value under both the income and market approaches  we ultimately determined the fair value of the reporting units based solely upon the income approach  as we believe this is the best indicator of fair value 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets at the unit of accounting level by making a determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we also evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  that asset is tested for impairment 
after recognition of the impairment  if any  the asset is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
we determine the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets under an income approach using the relief from royalty method  which assumes value to the extent that the acquired company is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the assets 
in our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment assessment for fiscal year  we concluded that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying value and  accordingly  we did not identify any impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 

table of contents long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other factors that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
we consider a long lived asset to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
if we deem an asset to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized only after services are provided  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and when collectability is probable 
our multiple element arrangements primarily include a combination of software licenses  hosted database and other services  installation and set up services  hardware  maintenance services and transaction based deliverables 
we generate a significant majority of our revenue from subscription based contracts where a monthly fee is charged  transaction based contracts where a fee per transaction is charged and subscription based contracts with additional transaction based fees where a monthly fee and a fee per transaction are charged 
subscription based and transaction based contracts generally include the delivery of software  access to our database through a hosted service  upfront fees for the implementation and set up activities necessary for the client to use access the software and maintenance 
under a subscription arrangement  we consider delivery of software  access to the hosted database and maintenance to be a combined unit of accounting and recognize related revenues at the end of each month upon the completion of the monthly service 
a transaction based fee represents a payment for the right to use the software  access to the hosted database and maintenance 
we consider the fee to be fixed and determinable only at the time actual usage occurs  and  accordingly  we recognize revenue at the time of actual usage 
implementation services and set up activities are necessary for the client to receive services software 
we defer up front fees billed during the implementation set up phase and recognize such revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life 
recognition of this deferred revenue will commence upon the start of the monthly service 
implementation and set up costs that are direct and incremental to the contract are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life 
as a result of our acquisition of explore  we also generate revenue from subscription based contracts to provide driver violation and undisclosed risk monitoring services 
we recognize revenue from subscription based contracts on a monthly basis as services are performed 
revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances  which are based on both specific identification of certain accounts and a predetermined percentage of revenue based on historical experience 
share based compensation 
we expense share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted common shares subject to repurchase  restricted stock units  and performance share units 
we estimate the value of stock options as of the date the award was granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine the expected volatility based on a combination of implied market volatilities  historical volatility of our stock price and other factors 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us constant rate treasury securities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the share based award 
expected dividend yield 
our assumption of the dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future 
expected award life 
because we have a limited history of stock option exercises  we determine the expected award life using the simplified method  which defines the life as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period 

table of contents in addition to the variables above  we are also required to estimate at the grant date the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on industry and employee turnover data as well as historical pre vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year 
we recognize additional share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and a recovery of previously recognized share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
the fair value of restricted stock units equals the intrinsic value on the date the award was granted 
to estimate the grant date fair value of performance share units  we utilize a monte carlo simulation model which simulates a range of possible future stock prices for us and the identified peer companies and assumes that the performance share units will be earned at target 
income taxes 
income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future enactments of changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax liabilities are more likely than not to be assessed 
if we ultimately determine that the obligation is unwarranted  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
this may occur for a variety of reasons  such as the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a particular tax return or the signing of a final settlement agreement with the respective tax authority 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences  or reversing book tax differences  resulting from differing treatment of items  such as amortization of intangibles  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable using the more likely than not standard 
in our assessment  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine that our deferred tax assets do not meet the more likely than not standard  we establish a valuation allowance 
we exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income 
if judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets change in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowances  which could impact our results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
as a result of our recent sustained history of operating profitability and management s determination that the future realization of our us net deferred tax assets was more likely than not  during fiscal year we released million of the million valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
at june   the remaining valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets is million 
we exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
if judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets change in future periods  we could be required to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in future periods 
based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our us deferred tax assets prior to expiration 
derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used principally in the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings 
derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked to market at the end of each accounting period with the results included in results of operations 
we do not currently hold any non hedge designated derivative instruments 

table of contents in april  in order to hedge our exposure to variability in the euro denominated cash flows associated with two intercompany loans  we entered into two pay fixed euros received fixed us dollar cross currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of million 
these cross currency swaps were designated  at inception  as cash flow hedges of the intercompany loans 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
accordingly  any foreign exchange gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income resulting from the periodic re measurement of the intercompany loans into us dollars is mitigated by an offsetting gain or loss  as the case may be  resulting from the change in the fair value of the swaps 
we estimate the fair value of our cross currency swaps using an income approach and standard valuation techniques that utilize market based observable inputs including spot and forward interest and foreign currency exchange rates  volatilities and interest rate curves at observable intervals 
our estimate of fair value also considers the risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled 
redeemable noncontrolling interests 
certain of the ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling owners are considered redeemable outside of our control 
accordingly  we have presented these redeemable noncontrolling interests as a mezzanine item in our consolidated balance sheet 
if redeemable at fair value  the redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported at their fair value with any adjustment of the carrying value to fair value recorded to common shares in stockholders equity 
we estimate the fair value of our noncontrolling interests through an income approach  utilizing a discounted cash flow model  and a market approach  which considers comparable companies and transactions 
under the income approach  the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
alternatively  the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period 
under the market approach  fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit 
the multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions  discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size  diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions 
in march  we acquired an additional ownership interest in our audatex espana majority owned subsidiary for a cash payment of million million 
in september  we sold a ownership interest in this subsidiary for a cash payment of million million 
the purchase price for the additional ownership interest and the sale price of the ownership interest were considered in the determination of the fair value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests using the market approach 
we are accreting the carrying value of the noncontrolling ownership interest in our autoonline majority owned subsidiary to the redemption value at each reporting period through the earliest redemption date 
accordingly  the carrying value of the autoonline noncontrolling interest represents the initial carrying amount  adjusted to reflect the noncontrolling interests share of net income and dividends paid  plus periodic accretion 
additionally  if the fair value of the autoonline noncontrolling interest were to exceed the redemption value  the accreted excess would be treated as an adjustment to the numerator in our calculation of net income per common share attributable to solera holdings  inc which would result in a decrease in our net income per share 
since the acquisition date  the fair value of the autoonline noncontrolling interest has been approximately equal to its redemption value

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world 
our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk 
we incur currency transaction risk when we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the local functional currency 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant local functional currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate 
the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in euros  pound sterling  swiss francs  canadian dollars and other foreign currencies

the average us dollar strengthened versus the euro by and the pound sterling by  which decreased our revenues and expenses during fiscal year a hypothetical increase or decrease in the us dollar versus other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to our revenues of million during fiscal year in april  in order to hedge our exposure to variability in the euro denominated cash flows associated with two intercompany loans  we entered into two pay fixed euros received fixed us dollar cross currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of million 
these cross currency swaps were designated  at inception  as cash flow hedges of the intercompany loans 
accordingly  any foreign exchange gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income resulting from the periodic re measurement of the intercompany loans into us dollars is mitigated by an offsetting gain or loss  as the case may be  resulting from the change in the fair value of the swaps 
during the fiscal years ended june    and  we recognized net foreign currency transaction losses in our consolidated statements of income of million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through variable interest rate borrowings under our amended credit facility 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding under our amended credit facility during fiscal year were million

a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an approximately million change to our interest expense for fiscal year in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility associated with our usd and euro denominated term loans  in august  we entered into two pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the maturity date of both swaps is may  which coincides with the maturity of our usd and euro denominated term loans and bear an interest rate of 
plus a margin for the us dollar denominated swap and
