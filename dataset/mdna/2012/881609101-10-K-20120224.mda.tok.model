our goals were focused on these strategic priorities during and we accomplished the following operational efficiency effectiveness commercial excellence financial discipline value driven growth increased refinery utilization to l decreased manufacturing costs per barrel from in to in l leveraged our logistics operations to strategically source advantaged crude and provide market optionality for the sale of refined products l increased exports off the west coast and expanded trading through tesoro panama company sa in support of our refining operations l reduced our total debt to total capitalization ratio from at the end of to at the end of l purchased million shares of common stock to offset the dilutive effects of previous stock based compensation awards l successfully completed the initial public offering of tesoro logistics lp in april l l strengthened refining and marketing integration through the addition of wholesale supply contracts for branded stations in and announced agreements to lease or purchase approximately additional retail stations beginning in l announced plans to invest in significant high return capital projects intended to improve yields  reduce feedstock and operating costs and expand our logistics infrastructure 
these investments are expected to better position the company competitively and deliver meaningful ebitda growth 
l l l l we plan during to continue to focus on our strategic priorities described above by executing a slate of capital projects focused on improving yields  reducing feedstock and operating costs  and expanding our logistics infrastructure at several of our refineries  focusing on opportunities that will allow us to increase the integration of our refining and marketing assets in order to maximize refinery utilization  expanding our supply and trading activities to support our refining operations and capitalize on market opportunities that allow us to maximize capture rates  and strengthening our balance sheet by retiring the remaining million of senior notes on or before maturity 

table of contents tesoro logistics lp as part of our business strategy  we formed tesoro logistics lp tllp to own  operate  develop and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets 
in april  tllp completed the initial public offering the offering of  common units at a price of per unit  which included a  share over allotment option that was exercised by the underwriters 
tesoro logistics gp  llc tlgp  a consolidated subsidiary  serves as the general partner of tllp 
headquartered in san antonio  texas  tllp s assets consist of a crude oil gathering system in the bakken shale williston basin area  eight refined products terminals in the western united states  a crude oil and refined products storage facility and five related short haul pipelines in utah 
tllp intends to expand its business through organic growth  including constructing new assets and increasing the utilization of existing assets  and by acquiring assets from us and third parties 
although we have historically operated our logistics assets primarily to support our refining and marketing business  we intend to grow our logistics operations to maximize the integrated value of our assets within the midstream and downstream value chain 
we believe tllp is well positioned to achieve its primary business objectives and execute business strategies based on its long term fee based contracts  relationship with us  assets positioned in the high demand bakken shale williston basin area  and financial flexibility 
we hold an approximate interest in tllp  including the interest of the general partner 
this interest includes  common units   subordinated units and  general partner units 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering  after deducting offering expenses the offering costs and debt issuance costs 
tllp retained million for working capital purposes and paid million in connection with entering into its revolving credit facility 
effective on the closing date of the offering  tllp entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement tllp revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks and financial institutions  which provides for borrowings under a revolving credit facility with total loan availability of million 
tllp borrowed million under the tllp revolving credit facility at the closing of the offering 
tllp distributed total proceeds to us of million  which includes million from the offering and million from the tllp revolving credit facility  in consideration of assets contributed and to reimburse us for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect to these assets 
the tllp revolving credit facility is non recourse to tesoro  except for tlgp which is tllp s general partner  and is guaranteed by all of tllp s subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of tllp s assets 
for additional information regarding our credit facilities  see capital resources and liquidity 
reconciliation of cash proceeds in millions total proceeds from the offering less offering costs  net of debt issuance costs proceeds from the offering  net of offering costs less debt issuance costs net proceeds from the offering less cash retained by tllp net proceeds distributed to tesoro from the offering add borrowings under the tllp revolving credit facility distribution to tesoro martinez crude oil marine terminal in december  we announced our intention to offer tllp the martinez crude oil marine terminal and are currently in negotiations with tllp 
the terminal consists of a single berth dock  five crude oil storage tanks with a combined storage capacity of  barrels and related pipelines that receive crude oil from third party marine vessels for delivery to our martinez refinery and a third party terminal 
total throughput capacity for the terminal is estimated to be approximately thousand barrels per day mbpd 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of the growth of tllp helps us capture the value of our embedded logistics assets 
as we are the general partner  and hold the related incentive distribution rights  we receive an increasing share in the incremental distributable cash flow the partnership generates 

table of contents unit train unloading facility in july  we announced that we expect to offer the unit train unloading facility at our washington refinery to tllp upon completion of construction  which is expected to be in the fourth quarter of the project includes unloading facilities for trains of rail cars unit trains and is expected to deliver up to mbpd of bakken crude oil to our washington refinery 
retail acquisitions during  we entered into agreements to expand our network of retail stations with the addition of stations between and  as part of our commitment to enhancing integration and growing our marketing business 
we entered into an agreement with supervalu  inc in september  to acquire approximately retail stations located primarily in washington  oregon  california  nevada  idaho  utah and wyoming 
in january  we completed the acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately million  including inventories of approximately million 
we assumed the obligations under the seller s leases and other agreements arising after the closing date 
supervalu  inc retained certain pre closing liabilities  including environmental matters 
we intend to invest approximately million to rebrand these stations from which we expect fuels sales of approximately mbpd 
we entered into an agreement with thrifty oil co 
and certain of its affiliates effective august  to lease approximately retail stations located primarily in southern california  for an aggregate amount of approximately million annually 
we estimate that these stations will provide an additional mbpd of ratable off take for our refining system after we invest approximately million to rebrand the network 
each retail station lease is for an initial term of years  with the option to renew for two additional five year terms 
we are scheduled to take possession of the retail stations in a phased transition  with approximately stations taken during the course of and the balance to come during hawaii operations we announced in january that we intend to sell our hawaii operations as part of a previously announced strategy to focus on the mid continent and west coast markets 
the assets for sale include the mbpd kapolei refinery  retail stations and the associated logistical assets 

table of contents industry overview our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and the aggregate value of the products we make from that crude oil and is affected by changes in economic conditions

crude oil and product price analysis the us economy continued to grow in  although at a slower pace than in this slower pace of domestic growth is attributable to a number of factors  including continued high unemployment rates 
the nationwide unemployment rate decreased from at the end of to at the end of in california  a key market area for tesoro  the state s unemployment rate fell by  to  from december to november global factors include increased geo political tensions in libya and the middle east as well as the effect of heightened european solvency concerns on the already slow paced recovery from the global financial collapse 
developing markets in asia and latin america continue to show stronger growth than oecd the organization for economic co operation and development member countries  although their market growth rates tempered toward year end 
this strong growth rate combined with refinery issues  primarily in latin america  have provided an export opportunity for us light products  particularly diesel exports 
as of november  net us exports of the three principle light products gasoline  jet  diesel exceeded mbpd 
as a result  these historically high exports have provided an outlet for us refining capacity  which has supported margins during this time 
these exports have been led primarily by distillates as the recovery in asian markets has improved global middle distillate values 
strong asian refining crack spreads  high demand in latin america and continued strength in us light product exports provided additional support during the year 
during  us west coast benchmark diesel fuel margins were up nearly from  while us west coast benchmark gasoline margins fell approximately as compared to higher consumer gasoline prices combined with the slow economic recovery continued to keep gasoline demand growth from recovering and continued to weaken gasoline margins 

table of contents the price differential between mid continent crudes and waterborne crudes increased during the year  contributing to strong refining margins in the mid continent region 
the west texas intermediate wti to brent differential averaged about per barrel in  compared to an average of per barrel in this differential was the result of mid continent crude oil logistics constraints combined with geo political and global supply issues 
the discount of wti to brent during the fourth quarter narrowed by per barrel  dropping from per barrel at the end of september to per barrel at the end of december this differential has averaged around per barrel during the first quarter of outlook the slow rate of economic recovery and the accompanying high unemployment continue to hinder the rate of recovery of transportation fuel demand 
the growing economies in the developing world are expected to continue to provide positive pressure on distillate margins  though gasoline margins  which are more driven by us consumers  are expected to remain in seasonal ranges 
internationally  recent events  both natural and geopolitical  have created interruptions in the supply chain for oil and other industries  which are causing readjustments in the market place 
the lingering effects of the earthquake in japan during are continuing to impact low sulfur fuel oil and heavy low sulfur crude oil prices in the pacific basin markets 
the libyan oil export disruption in increased uncertainty related to the supply of crude oil despite increased production by certain opec member countries and the release of about million barrels of crude oil from the us strategic petroleum reserve during the year 
more recently  concerns about closure of the strait of hormuz in the persian gulf have increased concerns about crude oil supply from the middle east 
additionally  the european debt crisis continues to add pressure to financial markets 
these international issues continue to impact crude oil and refined product prices and drive concerns about global and regional demand 
in addition to current market conditions  there are long term factors that may impact the supply and demand of refined products in the us including world crude oil prices  increased federal fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles  increased volumes of renewable fuels  mandated by the federal clean air act  various regulations of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary and mobile sources by the us environmental protection agency epa pursuant to the federal clean air act and by the state of california pursuant to ab  potential enactment of federal climate change legislation  and possible promulgation of national regulations relative to gasoline composition and ozone standards under the federal clean air act 

table of contents results of operations a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 
summary our net earnings in were million per diluted share compared with a net loss of million per diluted share in the increase in net earnings of per diluted share was primarily due to the following significant increases in gross refining margins in the pacific northwest and mid continent regions of million and million  respectively  driven by feedstock advantages from local crude discounts  and lower manufacturing cost per barrel  considerably higher refining throughput primarily as a result of increased utilization of  and the temporary shut down of processing at the washington refinery in  and growth in refining and marketing integration from the increased number of retail stations and wholesale supply contracts 
the increase in net earnings during relative to was partially offset by the following a million gain recognized in from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees as part of our strategy to reduce overhead and benefit expenses  a million higher loss in as compared to  related to write downs due to a change in scope of a capital project at our los angeles refinery  the receipt of million of business interruption and property insurance recoveries in  compared to the receipt of million of business interruption and property insurance recoveries in  related to the april  incident at our washington refinery  and a million increase in interest and financing costs in due to the write off of the remaining unamortized discount associated with the early redemption of our junior subordinated notes due and premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of a portion of our senior notes 
our net loss in was million per diluted share compared with a net loss of million per diluted share in the increase in net earnings of per diluted share was primarily due to the following contribution from our capital and non capital initiative program during which increased our overall margin through reduced transportation and feedstock costs  increased product margins  and improved refinery yields  increased gross refining margins due to local crude discounts and improved distillate margins partially offset by weaker gasoline margins  a million gain from the elimination of postretirement life insurance benefits for current and future retirees as part of our strategy to reduce overhead and benefit expenses  a million decrease in losses on our derivative instruments  improved contribution of million from our retail marketing segment  and a goodwill write off of million in compared to million in the decrease in net loss during relative to was partially offset by the following lower throughput primarily from the temporary shut down of processing at our washington refinery and completion of scheduled refinery turnarounds at several of our other refineries 
the gross margin impact of the temporary shut down at the washington refinery was partially offset by the receipt of million in business interruption insurance recoveries  a million increase in incentive and stock based compensation expense  primarily as a result of increases in tesoro stock prices during as compared to  and a reduction in cost of sales of million resulting from a last in  first out lifo liquidation benefit during

operating income for our refining segment increased by million to billion from to the increase is primarily due to an improved margin environment  significant crude oil cost advantages and higher refinery throughput during gross refining margins 
our gross refining margin per barrel increased by per barrel  or  to per barrel in as compared to  reflecting high industry distillate margins throughout the year 
crude oils that we purchase are primarily priced off of certain crude oil benchmarks such as wti and brent 
mid continent crude oil logistic constraints continued to elevate the price spread between crude oil priced off wti as compared to crude oil priced off waterborne crude oil benchmarks throughout most of this decreased the relative crude oil costs for our mid continent refineries and contributed to strong refining margins for that region 
industry distillate margins on the us west coast increased approximately during  as exports of distillate and continued economic growth in asia and latin america supported demand

operating income for our refining segment increased by million  to million from to the increase primarily reflects improved total gross refining margins of million during the year 
the increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase of million in manufacturing and other operating expenses 
gross refining margins 
our gross refining margin per barrel increased by per barrel  or  to per barrel in as compared to per barrel in  primarily due to significantly higher industry diesel fuel margins and our initiatives to improve our margin capture rates  partially offset by lower industry margins for gasoline 
industry diesel fuel margins in the us west coast region increased  primarily due to strong exports and increased manufacturing activity nationwide 
industry gasoline margins on the us west coast decreased in as compared to reflecting poor global demand and higher inventories resulting from high domestic unemployment rates 
during  we reduced our transportation and feedstock costs  realized better refinery yields and improved margins on finished products  which improved consolidated gross margin 
our california refineries benefited from improved product yields and increased throughput of discounted foreign heavy crude oils as these refineries run a high proportion of heavy crude oils of total refining throughput during 
in addition  we experienced higher gross refining margins at our mid continent refineries due to increased use of discounted local crudes and downtime at other refineries in the region

table of contents environmental and other matters we are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations  including environmental and income tax matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty  we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate 
we believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position  although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations 
additionally  if applicable  we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications to certain emission sources  equipment or facilities 
future expenditures may be required to comply with the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements for our various sites  including our refineries  tank farms  pipelines  operating retail stations  closed retail stations  operating refined products terminals and closed refined products terminals 
the impact of these legislative and regulatory developments  including any greenhouse gas cap and trade program or low carbon fuel standards  could result in increased compliance costs  additional operating restrictions on our business and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in  the epa proposed regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act 
the first of these regulations  finalized on april   sets standards for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from light trucks and cars 
it could reduce the demand for our manufactured transportation fuels 
in addition  other finalized regulations include permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases above a certain threshold 
the resulting permitting requirements could impose emission controls that increase required capital expenditures at our refineries 
we cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in december  the us congress passed the energy independence and security act that created a second renewable fuels standard rfs 
this standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels sold or introduced in the us to reach billion gallons in and to increase to billion gallons by the requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture 
in the near term  the rfs presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol  alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries 
we are currently meeting the rfs requirements through a combination of blending renewable fuels and purchases of renewable identification numbers rins in the open market 
additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels 
we cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in california  assembly bill ab  created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to emissions levels by ab focuses on using market mechanisms  such as a cap and trade program and a low carbon fuel standard lcfs to achieve emissions reduction targets 
although a court ruled the lcfs unconstitutional in january  the california air resources board has appealed the decision 
the lcfs became effective in january and would have required a reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by final regulations for all other aspects of ab  including cap and trade requirements  are being developed by the california air resources board 
these regulations should take effect in and are to be fully implemented by we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the court s ruling on the lcfs and the implementation and implications of ab will take many years to realize 
consequently  we cannot currently predict ab s impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and foreign tax laws and regulations 
newly enacted tax laws and regulations  and changes in existing tax laws and regulations  could result in increased expenditures in the future 
we are also subject to audits by federal  state and foreign taxing authorities in the normal course of business 
it is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities 
we believe that resolution of any such claim s would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 

table of contents environmental liabilities we are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining  pipeline  terminal and retail station properties 
we have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate based on current information and projections that can be reasonably estimated 
our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering assessments  and it is possible that our projections will change and that additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available 
at december  and december   our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled million and million  respectively 
of this amount million and million  respectively  relate to environmental liabilities for site clean up activities assumed from a prior owner  arising from operations at our martinez refinery prior to august certain projects at the martinez refinery are subject to a cost share agreement where we are responsible for of the expenditures 
approximately million of our obligations are related to this agreement 
we cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial activities that may be required at the martinez refinery 
therefore  it is possible that we will identify additional investigation and remediation costs as more information becomes available 
we have filed insurance claims under environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to million for expenditures in excess of million in self insurance  but the insurer has challenged coverage and filed a declaratory relief action in federal court 
we have not recognized possible insurance recoveries related to this matter 
we have investigated conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our martinez refinery 
the investigation was driven by an order received in from the san francisco bay regional water quality control board 
the order named us as well as two previous owners of the martinez refinery 
we cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order  but we believe it will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity

key provisions of the act require that standardized swaps be cleared through a registered clearinghouse and executed on a registered trading platform with specific margin requirements 
these requirements could make these products more complicated or costly by creating new regulatory risks and increasing reporting  capital  and administrative requirements for companies that use derivatives for hedging and trading activities 
final rules implementing this statute were approved by the commodity futures trading commission on october   and are expected to be effective in mid  subject to potential legal challenge 
although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these rules  and currently believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position  the final rules may result in increased hedging costs and cash collateral requirements  which could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations

the plaintiffs allege  in part  that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product 
the suits generally seek individual  unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney s fees 
we intend to vigorously assert our defenses against these claims 
in december  we reached agreement to settle two of the remaining five lawsuits pending a court s approval of the settlement
