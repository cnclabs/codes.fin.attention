item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse commercial and industrial market segments 
we have five reportable segments food service equipment group  engraving group  engineering technologies group  electronics products group  and the hydraulics products group 
our ongoing focused diversity strategy is to deliver superior returns and greater shareholder value through the identification of and investment in businesses that provide value added and technology driven customer solutions 
as part of this ongoing strategy  in december  the company decided to divest its air distribution products adp business unit  which was previously reported as a stand alone segment 
we determined that as a more commodity like product  adp was not well aligned with our strategic objectives 
on march   we completed the sale of adp to a private equity buyer for consideration of million in cash and a million secured note in anticipation of using the proceeds from the sale to further implement our focused diversity strategy 
subsequent to year end  we executed on this plan by acquiring meder electronic group meder  an investment which will substantially broaden our global footprint  product line offerings  and end user markets in the electronics products segment 
since the beginning of the macroeconomic recession  we have reduced our cost structure through company wide and targeted headcount reductions  low cost manufacturing initiatives  plant consolidations  procurement savings  and improved productivity in all aspects of our operations 
also  in light of commodity inflation that a number of our business units have experienced  we have initiated a number of price increases in the marketplace in order to at least partially offset these cost increases and improve profitability 
these efforts have allowed the company to significantly improve margins since and improve profitability despite sales only recently returning to above their pre recession peak 
in addition to the focus on improving our cost structure  we continue to focus on the company s liquidity through improved working capital management  the sale of excess land and buildings  and the disposal of adp 
we ended in a net cash position  as our net debt to capital ratio at june  was 
this additional liquidity to pursue acquisitive growth initiatives is evidenced by the four strategic acquisitions during and the acquisition of meder in we also continue to concentrate our attention on driving market share gains in what we expect will be a highly competitive  low growth environment in our end user markets 
each of our business units has developed a series of top line initiatives that we believe will provide opportunities for market share gains  which should supplement future economic growth in our markets 
these growth initiatives include new product introductions  expansion of product offerings through private labeling and sourcing agreements  geographic expansion of sales coverage and the use of new sales channels  leveraging strategic customer relationships  development of energy efficient products  new applications for existing products and technology  and next generation products and services for our end user markets 
as we advance our strategy in  we expect to face a few headwinds including a soft european economy  negative year over year foreign exchange comparisons  and increased expense associated with our legacy defined benefit pension plan in the us at the same time  our ongoing efforts to implement focused diversity position us well to offset the effect that these factors may have on our results 
because of the diversity of the company s businesses  end user markets and geographic locations  management does not use specific external indices to predict the future performance of the company  other than general information about broad macroeconomic trends 
each of our individual business units serves niche markets and attempts to identify trends other than general business and economic conditions which are specific to their businesses and which could impact their performance 
those units report pertinent information to senior management  which uses it to the extent relevant to assess the future performance of the company 
a description of any such material trends is described below in the applicable segment analysis 
we monitor a number of key performance indicators kpis including net sales  income from operations  backlog  effective income tax rate  and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these kpis is included within the discussion below 
we may also supplement the discussion of these kpis by identifying the impact of foreign exchange rates  acquisitions  and other significant items when they have a material impact on the discussed kpi 
we believe that the discussion of these items provides enhanced information to investors by disclosing their consequence on the overall trend in order to provide a clearer comparative view of the kpi where applicable 
for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on kpis  the company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period kpi calculated at the current period exchange rate as compared to the kpi calculated at the historical exchange rate for the prior period 
for discussion of the impact of acquisitions  we isolate the effect to the kpi amount that would have existed regardless of our acquisition 
sales resulting from synergies between the acquisition and existing operations of the company are considered organic growth for the purposes of our discussion 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin restructuring costs gain on sale of real estate income from operations backlog realizable within year net sales net sales  as reported components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales growth decline net sales in increased million  or  from levels 
of the increase  million  or was attributable to organic growth  as organic sales increased across all of our segments as a result of both improvements in end user markets and the success of our top line growth efforts 
also factoring in our growth was an increase of million  or  resulting from our four acquisitions completed during unfavorable foreign exchange accounted for million against our year over year gains 
net sales in increased million  or  from levels 
of the increase  million  or was attributable to organic growth  as organic sales increased across all of our segments except engineering technologies  which demonstrated historically lumpy revenues and had a difficult prior year comparison due to several large project deliveries in the increases in our other segments are a result of both improvements in end user markets and the success of our top line growth efforts 
also factoring in our growth was an increase of million  or  resulting from our four acquisitions completed during the year 
favorable foreign exchange accounted for the remaining million  or of revenue increase 
gross profit margin during  our gross margin was flat at as compared to  as lower gross margin in the food service equipment group offset increases across our other segments 
during  our gross margin was slightly down at as compared to in in  our cost of sales included million of purchase accounting related expenses during the year 
income from operations income from operations during increased million  or compared to this increase was driven by strong performances by the engraving  electronics products  and hydraulics products groups 
the engraving group benefitted from a second consecutive record year of automotive platform work  while the electronics products and hydraulics products groups continue to demonstrate the impact of prior cost reductions combined with end user market recovery and entry into new markets and applications 
additionally  the engineering technologies group was bolstered by the acquisition of metal spinners impacting the full year 
income from operations during increased million  or compared to the increase was due to improvements in both the engraving and electronics and hydraulics groups 
in the engraving group  increased volume and previous cost reduction efforts were augmented by a favorable mix of automotive platform work 
driving the increase as well were the electronics products and hydraulics products groups  which also benefitted from increased volume combined with the impact of previous cost reduction efforts 
discussion of the performance of all of our groups is more fully explained in the segment analysis that follows 
income taxes the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million  or an effective rate of  compared to million  or an effective rate of for the year ended june   and million  or an effective rate of for the year ended june  changes in the effective tax rates from period to period may be significant as they depend on many factors including  but not limited to  the amount of the company s income or loss  the mix of income earned in the us versus outside the us  the effective tax rate in each of the countries in which we earn income  and any one time tax issues which occur during the period 
in  we expect to return to a more normal tax rate in the range of to based on an anticipated increase in us based taxable income within our overall business mix 
the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by the following items i a benefit of million from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations and re measurement of existing tax contingency reserves based on recently completed tax examinations  ii a benefit of million related to a decrease in the statutory tax rate in the united kingdom on prior period deferred tax liabilities recorded during the first quarter  and iii a benefit of million due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with beneficial tax rates 
the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by the following items i a benefit of million from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable limitation statutes  ii a benefit of million related primarily to the retroactive extension of the r d credit recorded during the second quarter  and iii a benefit totaling million as part of the deferred tax provision related to a change in the estimated state rate used to calculate the deferred balances 
the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by a benefit of million from the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this allowance was primarily related to foreign loss carry forwards whose recovery was assessed as more likely than not based on events occurring during the year ended june  capital expenditures in general  our capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be approximately equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
in  capital expenditures of million began shifting back to our historical trend as we made strategic investments which supported productivity improvements  geographic expansion  and development of new product offerings 
in  capital expenditures of million were below our annual depreciation of million  as we chose to focus our spending on acquisitions in lieu of capital expenditures 
backlog backlog at june  increased million from million to million when compared to fiscal  a increase 
backlog was approximately flat for the hydraulics products group  with our other segments all showing double digit increases year over year 
the food service equipment and engraving groups were the strongest drivers  with increases of and  respectively 
segment analysis in thousands food service equipment compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales for the year ended june  increased million  or  from the same period one year earlier 
this includes a minor negative effect of foreign exchange rates of million in sales 
the refrigerated solutions walk in coolers and freezers and refrigerated cabinets and cooking solutions groups grew approximately and year over year  respectively  while the other food service equipment businesses grew net sales by 
the refrigeration business continues to see strong sales across the board to our quick service restaurant chain customers  and we are seeing continued traction in the dollar store segment where we are growing market share and the customer base 
from a product standpoint  we continue to see double digit growth in our value line products and rack refrigeration systems 
sales in cooking solutions were driven by us business at bki  whereas aai was negatively impacted by lower sales to major quick service chains and lower sales to uk retail accounts due to the macroeconomic conditions impacting that market 
our equity investment and distribution agreement with giorik spa  an italian manufacturer of combi ovens  was well received at the two spring trade shows  and we are working with our customer base in both the us and uk to complete required customer testing and evaluation 
we expect to see the benefits of this strategic alliance in the second half of income from operations for fiscal increased million  or  when compared to the same period one year earlier 
this includes the minor negative effect of foreign exchange rates of million 
the group s return on sales decreased from to in the prior year 
the positive impact of the year over year volume increase was partially offset by a combination of reduced volume  adverse product and channel mix changes  coupled with higher commodity prices earlier in the year and increased warranty costs at cooking solutions 
additionally  productivity was negatively impacted by the integration of kool star product lines into our master bilt facility in mississippi  and the integration of tri star manufacturing operations into our nogales  mexico facility 
however  these issues were largely corrected at the end of the fourth quarter 
in response to these margin challenges  the group has implemented price increases and multiple productivity improvement actions  including freight and metal cost reduction efforts 
net sales for the year ended june  increased million  or  from the same period one year earlier  of which resulted from organic growth 
the acquisition of tri star contributed approximately of the increase in sales 
the refrigerated solutions walk in cooler and refrigerated cabinets and cooking solutions groups grew approximately and year over year  respectively  while the custom solutions group grew net sales 
income from operations for fiscal decreased million  or  when compared to the positive impact of the year over year volume increase  cost reductions due to facility consolidations  supply chain cost reductions and labor productivity increases was overcome by a combination of negative product and channel mix resulting in lower margin sales  pricing pressures  and increased commodities prices 
engraving compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in the engraving group increased million  or  from levels at million compared to million in the prior year 
foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of million in fiscal year our mold texturizing businesses continued to demonstrate strong top line growth on a global basis due to the release of new automotive programs  which also created an improved product mix due to their generally higher margins 
we expect this trend to slow slightly in based on currently anticipated program work and the effect of currency translation in europe 
however  we will continue to grow this business via expansion into emerging markets including china  india  korea and brazil  where we expect strong growth in the automotive and non automotive markets for mold texturizing 
we believe that our global infrastructure and proximity to our customers  as well as our technology and responsiveness to automotive oem customers needs  will allow us to remain the number one choice for their texturing services 
our roll plate and machinery equipment sales continued to experience a soft market due to lower capital spending budgets at our customers  however  quotation activity increased in the fourth quarter income from operations increased by million  or  when compared to we have demonstrated our ability to favorably leverage sales growth as we expand the use of lean enterprise techniques 
we also continued to develop and globalize market leading technology in order to further improve profitability 
going into  we will be moving our brazil facility into a leased building better suited to our operational needs and cost structure  which will result in a restructuring charge during the first quarter of the year 
net sales in increased from levels at million compared to million in foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of million during the year 
our mold texturizing businesses continued to strengthen based on the release of new automotive programs  which also created an improved product mix due to their generally higher margins 
our roll plate and machinery equipment sales continued to experience a soft market due to lower capital spending budgets at our customers 
income from operations in increased by million  or  when compared to restructuring of the business and significant cost reduction efforts implemented in  as well as headcount reductions in our european operations in  were significant in the improvement of operating income year over year 
with our new lower cost structure and focus on growth  we demonstrated our ability to improve income from operations on flat sales in in  we demonstrated that we had favorably leveraged sales growth and further improved our operating performance 
engineering technologies compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in the fiscal year increased million or  when compared to the prior year 
the increase is a result of the acquisition of metal spinners group 
negative organic growth of occurred in our legacy businesses as increases in the aerospace segment at spincraft were more than offset by declines in the energy  aviation and the defense markets 
as expected  the energy business was down significantly year over year as one of our major customers implemented an inventory correction program 
the aerospace segment increased from prior year levels due to strong demand for unmanned vehicles 
the defense sector was down primarily due to order phasing and a difficult prior year comparison  but we expect this sector to improve in at metal spinners  oil gas business will be soft in the first half of  but we expect it to return to levels for all of calendar year based on forecasted demand 
for the fiscal year ending june   income from operations increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this increase was driven by the acquisition of metal spinners 
the improvement from metal spinners was offset by the impact of reduced sales volume at spincraft

electronics products compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin electronics products sales increased million  or in when compared to the prior year 
sales growth was negatively impacted during the first three quarters of as we experienced soft demand for reed switches  particularly in the asia pacific region  and soft demand from a number of larger oem accounts for sensors and magnetic products 
however  sales strengthened significantly in the fourth quarter as we benefited from a number of new products and customer project launches within the automotive  appliance  medical  and hvac sensor and magnetic markets and strengthening demand for reed switches 
this pipeline of new programs remains robust and is expected to contribute to solid top line growth in additionally  will see the impact of the meder acquisition  which will add complementary geographic regions  products  markets  and sales 
income from operations in increased million  or  compared to the year over year improvement was the result of the sales increase as well as the impact of various material and labor cost savings particularly within the north american businesses 
the higher sales level and the various cost reduction initiatives drove operating income margin from in to for while the purchase accounting from meder will negatively impact the first quarter  we expect the acquisition to be accretive to the year in the range of to per diluted share 
sales for the group increased million  or  in when compared to this increase is due to improved market conditions in our end user markets and market share gains resulting from our top line organic growth initiatives 
we moved into new regions  products  and markets by adding new internal and third party sales representatives in the united states  europe and asia 
we remain in a unique position relative to our competition  as we are able to provide engineering expertise on a global basis combined with the low cost manufacturing from our facilities located in mexico and china 
our north american based competition typically cannot offer the same low cost manufacturing position and competitors located in china cannot provide the same level of new product and application engineering capability 
income from operations during increased million  or compared to as improved pricing and productivity improvements allowed us to continue to leverage volume at our low cost facilities in mexico and china 
hydraulics products compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in for the hydraulics products group increased million  or when compared to conditions in the north american dump trailer market continue to improve 
diversification into other markets has been a major contributor to the growth  as demonstrated by market share gains at several north american refuse market oems 
the manufacturing facility in tianjin  china has also been a factor in our top line growth  as this facility is now producing both rod and telescopic cylinders for global customers 
the ability to offer our engineering expertise on a global basis combined with manufacturing locations in the united states and a low cost operation in china has allowed us to penetrate markets where we previously could not be competitive 
expansion of business geographically into areas such as southeast asia  australia  central america and south america is contributing to the increase outside of our historical focus on the north american market 
we are currently adding capacity to our china facility in anticipation of continued growth from these markets 
income from operations for increased million or when compared to this increase in annual income from operations can be attributed to leveraging the top line growth  cost containment and process and productivity improvements 
sales for the group in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to sales of million 
business in the domestic dump truck and dump trailer markets began to improve due to increases in coal mining  requirements for aggregate  and the replacement of aging equipment by municipalities 
our diversification efforts in the chinese domestic market  the move into alternative markets such as oil gas and refuse vehicles  as well as sales into southeast asia  australia  central america and south america  also contributed to the increase 
income from operations in was million  an increase of million  or  from income from operations of million 
the increase in sales during the period had a dramatic positive impact on income due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives taken in corporate  restructuring and other compared to compared to change change income loss from operations corporate gain on sale of real estate restructuring corporate expenses in increased million  or as compared to  driven primarily by increased management bonus and stock compensation expense related to exceeding performance targets for the year

we will be relocating the plant to a leased facility in an industrial park that is more suited to our operational needs and cost structure 
in  the company recorded a gain of million from the sale of an excess facility in lyon  france  that was the site of a former engraving group operation 
restructuring expenses reflect costs associated with the company s efforts to continuously improve operational efficiency and expand globally in order to remain competitive in the end user markets we serve 
each year the company incurs costs for actions to size its businesses to a level appropriate for current economic conditions and to improve its cost structure to improve our competitive posture and to improve operating margins 
restructuring expenses result from numerous individual actions implemented across the company s various operating divisions on an ongoing basis and include costs for moving facilities to low cost locations  starting up plants after relocation  curtailing downsizing operations because of changing economic conditions  and other costs resulting from asset redeployment decisions 
shutdown costs include severance  benefits  stay bonuses  lease and contract terminations and asset write downs 
in addition to the costs of moving fixed assets  start up and moving costs include employee training and relocation 
vacant facility costs include maintenance  utilities  property taxes  and other costs

these expenses primarily related to the relocation of tri star manufacturing operations to nogales  mexico  the consolidation of kool star into our master bilt operations in mississippi  and ongoing headcount reductions in our european engraving operations 
during the company incurred restructuring expense of million 
the majority of these expenses related to the continuation of two initiatives begun in the relocation of our dallas food service equipment group manufacturing operations to nogales  mexico  and headcount reductions in our european engraving operations 
we also incurred additional expenses in the food service equipment group as we began integrating tri star into our nogales facility and consolidated customer service functions for the cooking solutions businesses 
the company currently expects to incur between and million of restructuring expense in  including the costs to complete actions initiated before the end of and actions anticipated to be approved and initiated during discontinued operations in december  we decided to divest the adp business unit 
in connection with this decision  the company adjusted the carrying value of adp s assets to their net realizable value based on a range of expected sale prices 
as a result  the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and impairment charges of million to fixed assets

as the former owner of berean  the company is party under a number of operating leases which were assigned to the purchaser of the business for the remaining initial terms of the leases at the stated lease costs 
the company remained an obligor of these leases until the expiration of the initial terms 
in june  berean filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and  in july  its assets were sold to a third party under section of the code 
the new owner of the berean assets has infused capital into the business  and we believe the berean bookstores can now be operated successfully as a going concern 
as part of this transaction  the company agreed to provide lease supplement payments to the new owner of the berean assets 
the company remained an obligor of the leases assumed by the new owner  however  our obligation was reduced for locations where the new owner was able to obtain rent concessions

the new facility also includes a million sublimit for swing line loans and a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the new credit facility replaced the credit agreement  which was scheduled to mature in september under the terms of the credit agreement  we will pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee on available  but unused  amounts under the new facility 
the amount of the commitment fee will depend upon both the undrawn amount remaining available under the new facility and the company s funded debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement ratio at particular points in time 
as our funded debt to ebitda ratio increases  the commitment fee will increase

our primary cash requirements in addition to day to day operating needs include interest payments  capital expenditures  and dividends 
our primary sources of cash for these requirements are cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the new facility 
we expect to spend between and million on capital expenditures during  and expect that depreciation and amortization expense will be between and million and and million  respectively 
in order to manage our interest rate exposure  we are party to million of floating to fixed rate swaps 
these swaps convert our interest payments from libor to a weighted average rate of 
the following table sets forth our capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt current portion of long term debt long term debt total debt less cash net cash debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity decreased year over year primarily as a result of changes in unrealized pension losses of million 
also affecting equity were net income of million  dividends of million  unfavorable foreign currency movements of million  and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to treasury stock activity  offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock based compensation in the current year

we sponsor a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans 
the company s pension plan for us salaried employees was frozen as of december  participants in the us salaried pension and supplemental defined benefit plans no longer accrue future benefits 
the fair value of the company s us pension plan assets was million at june  and the projected benefit obligation in the us was million at that time 
during  we made a voluntary contribution of million to the plan 
in june  the moving ahead for progress in the st century map bill was signed into law 
based on changes in pension funding provisions under map  we made an additional million contribution subsequent to june due to its favorable treatment under the bill and retroactive treatment under the pension protection act ppa 
as a result of this additional contribution in conjunction with the voluntary contribution made in  the plan is funded under ppa rules  and we do not expect to make mandatory contributions to the plan until we do not expect contributions to our other defined benefit plans to be material in we have evaluated the current and long term cash requirements of our defined benefit and defined contribution plans as of june  our operating cash flows from continuing operations and available liquidity are expected to be sufficient to cover required contributions under erisa and other governing regulations 
we have an insurance program for certain retired key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which we have the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits

at june   we had million of non current liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future payments related to these obligations 
off balance sheet items in march  the company sold substantially all of the assets of the adp business 
in connection with the divestiture  the company remained the lessee of adp s philadelphia  pa facility and administrative offices  with the purchaser subleasing a fractional portion of the building at current market rates 
in connection with the transaction  the company recognized a lease impairment charge of million for the remaining rental expense 
the company s aggregate obligation with respect to the lease is million  of which million was recorded as a liability at june  additionally  the company remained an obligor on an additional facility lease that was assumed in full by the buyer  for which our aggregate obligation in the event of default by the buyer is million 
with the exception of the impaired portion of the philadelphia lease  the company does not expect to make any payments with respect to these obligations 
the buyer s obligations under the respective sublease and assumed lease are secured by a cross default provision in the purchaser s promissory note for a portion of the purchase price which is secured by mortgages on the adp real estate sold in the transaction 
in connection with the sale of the berean christian bookstores completed in august  we assigned all but one lease to the buyers 
during june  the berean business filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the berean assets were subsequently resold under section of the code 
the new owners of the berean business have negotiated lower lease rates and extended lease terms at certain of the leased locations

we had no other material off balance sheet items at june   other than the operating leases summarized above 
other matters inflation certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
we monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us 
foreign currency translation our primary functional currencies used by our non us subsidiaries are the euro  british pound sterling pound  mexican peso  and chinese yuan 
during the current year  the pound sterling  peso  and euro have experienced decreases in value relative to the us dollar  our reporting currency 
since june  the euro has depreciated by  the pound has depreciated by  and the peso has depreciated by all relative to the us dollar 
these lower exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into non us dollars at the end of the current year 
defined benefit pension plans we record expenses related to these plans based upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates and assumed rates of returns 
based on current assumptions  we are projecting an increase of million  or per share  of additional expense related to our legacy us plan in and compared to environmental matters during  the company entered into an administrative order of consent with the us environmental protection agency related to the removal of various pcb contaminated materials and soils at a site where the company leased a building and conducted operations from see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this event 
seasonality we are a diversified business with generally low levels of seasonality  however our fiscal third quarter is typically the period with the lowest level of activity 
employee relations the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
we renegotiated three union contracts during  and in each case reached an agreement 
there are no union contracts expiring during the company maintains good working relations with all of its unions  however  there can be no guarantee that agreements can be reached in future negotiations 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all of our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
collectability of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount of the asset 
the company s annual test for impairment is performed using a may st measurement date 
we have identified our reporting units for impairment testing as our twelve operating segments  which are aggregated into our five reporting segments as disclosed in note industry segment information 
the test for impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed  wherein the reporting unit s carrying value is compared to the implied fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  impairment exists and must be recognized 
as quoted market prices are not available for the company s reporting units  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model income approach 
this method uses various assumptions that are specific to each individual reporting unit in order to determine the fair value 
in addition  the company compares the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to its overall market capitalization 
our annual impairment testing at each reporting unit relied on assumptions surrounding general market conditions  short term growth rates  and a terminal growth rate of  and detailed management forecasts of future cash flows prepared by the relevant reporting unit 
fair values were determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital of 
an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points in the analysis would not result in the identification of any impairments 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  changes in assumptions could significantly affect our valuations and result in impairments in the future 
the most significant assumption involved in the company s determination of fair value is the cash flow projections of each reporting unit 
certain of our reporting units have been significantly impacted by the current global economic downturn  and if the effects of the current global economic environment are protracted or the recovery is slower than we have projected estimates of future cash flows for each reporting unit may be insufficient to support the carrying value of the reporting units  requiring the company to re assess its conclusions related to fair value and the recoverability of goodwill 
as a result of our annual assessment  the company determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 
therefore  no impairment charges were recorded in connection with our assessments during and in connection with the divestiture of adp  the company determined that  based on the net realizable value of the business in the transaction  the goodwill of the adp reporting unit was impaired 
as such  the company recognized million in impairment charges in discontinued operations during the second quarter of cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some postretirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of in the us is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
the us discount rate of reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions  including discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a twenty five basis point change in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million per year 
a twenty five basis point basis point change in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million annually 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 
business combinations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation 
during this measurement period  the company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended accounting guidance for goodwill in order to simplify how companies test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments permit a company to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  a company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this accounting pronouncement to have a material effect on our financial statements when implemented 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in either case  a company is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
regardless of choice in presentation  of which we are currently evaluating  a company is required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
in december  the fasb delayed indefinitely the portion of the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments in the income statement 
for public companies  these amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively 
early adoption is permitted 
other than a change in presentation  the implementation of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements when implemented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan and non qualified defined contribution plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  we have no interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk we are exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
the transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service on intercompany accounts 
we also mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risks by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
the contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend payments  loan payments  and materials purchases  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair values of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
at june  and  the fair value  in the aggregate  of the company s open foreign exchange contracts was not material 
our primary translation risk is with the euro  british pound sterling  and chinese yuan 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of any these foreign currencies to the us dollar at june   would not result in a material change in our operations  financial position  or cash flows 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate the company s effective rate on variable rate borrowings under the revolving credit agreement increased from at june  to at june  our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  we will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
we are currently entered into million of floating to fixed rate swaps with terms ranging from two to five years 
these swaps convert our interest payments from libor to a weighted average rate of 
due to the impact of the swaps  an increase in interest rates would not materially impact our annual interest expense at june  concentration of credit risk we have a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for all commodities used in its manufacturing processes 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
while standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good  there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage 
the engineering technologies  food service equipment and electronics and hydraulics groups are all sensitive to price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
in the past year  we have experienced price fluctuations for a number of materials including steel  copper wire  other metal commodities  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these materials are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
wherever possible  we will implement price increases to offset the impact of changing prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  if implemented  will be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
