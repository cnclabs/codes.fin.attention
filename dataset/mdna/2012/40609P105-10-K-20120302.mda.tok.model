item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview the largest portion of our business is devoted to underground coal mining in the state of indiana through sunrise coal llc a wholly owned subsidiary serving the electric power generation industry 
we also own a equity interest in savoy energy  lp  a private oil and gas company with operations in michigan 
in late december we invested million for a interest in sunrise energy  llc which then purchased existing gas reserves and gathering equipment from an unrelated third party with plans to develop and operate such reserves 
sunrise energy also plans to develop and explore for coal bed methane gas reserves on or near our underground coal reserves 
development is pending an increase in nat gas prices 
the primary reason we consummated this purchase was to protect our coal reserves from unwanted fracking by unrelated third parties 
we account for our investments in savoy and sunrise energy using the equity method 
through our denver operations we also lease oil and gas mineral rights with the intent to sell the prospects to third parties and retain an overriding royalty interest orri or carried interest 
occasionally  we participate in the drilling of oil and gas wells 
further below are discussions of savoy  our successful lease play in north dakota and our orris in wyoming 
our largest contributor to revenue and earnings is the carlisle underground coal mine located in western indiana  about thirty miles south of terre haute 
the carlisle mine was in the development stage through january  coal shipments began february  outlook headwinds created by low natural gas prices  mild weather  and weaker domestic economies impacted coal markets during the year  and market weakness continues as we enter the current exceptionally mild winter has dramatically decreased demand for electricity since october  heating degree days are down by percent compared to normal  and electricity demand is estimated to be down by percent 
this lack of demand is a major factor behind the current low near term gas and coal prices 
unless there is a dramatic cold snap  these conditions are expected to persist until the summer 
for we will continue to focus on maintaining our low cost structure and leasing and permitting new reserves 
we do see an increasing demand for coal produced in the ilb in the future 
demand for coal produced in the ilb is expected to grow at a rate faster than overall us coal demand  due to ilb coal having higher heating content than prb and lower cost structure than central app coal 
many utilities are scrubbing to meet emission requirements beyond just sulfur compliance  even utilities that burn exclusively prb 
once scrubbed  those utilities are usually capable of burning ilb coal 
it is this trend of new scrubber installations coupled with rising central app cost structure that is leading to increased switching from central app coal to ilb coal 
some fuel switching will also occur from prb to ilb in newly scrubbed utilities located near ilb coal supply 
growth in international coal import demand has resulted primarily from increased demand for thermal coal for electricity generation by emerging global economies  particularly by asian countries in the pacific market where coal is the primary fuel source for new power generation 
we believe that the widening of the panama canal in should lower freight rates which would enhance coal exports to asia 
in europe  domestic coal supply has declined due to reduction in domestic production as a result of the region s declining coal reserve base and a reduction in government subsidies for coal mining  particularly in poland  germany and spain 
additionally  the international atomic energy agency projects slower global growth in nuclear power capacity following the earthquake in japan and related nuclear incident 
germany  in particular  has closed certain older facilities and is planning to shut down its remaining nuclear plants by coal fired generation is expected to meet a large portion of this additional demand 
we believe that the decline in domestic production in europe  coupled with an expected increase in coal fired power generation  will result in an increase in thermal coal imports 
due to the location of our coal mine  we expect to continue concentrating our efforts on supplying the domestic market 
we expect as more coal is exported from the ilb  the coal that remains for the domestic market will increase in value 
as discussed further under competitive pressures on page nine  natural gas has increased its share as a fuel in electrical generation in recent years 
yorktown distribution as previously disclosed  each time after we filed our form qs for the first three quarters  we were advised by yorktown energy partners vi  lp  an investor for the last sixyears  that it had distributed shares of our common stock to its limited and general partners 
first and second quarter distributions were  shares each and the third quarter distribution was  shares for a total of  shares 
after the three distributions  yorktown and its affiliates collectively hold about million shares of our common stock representing about of total shares outstanding 
while we do not know yorktown s ultimate strategy to realize the value of their hallador investment for their partners  we expect that over time distributions such as these will improve our liquidity and float 
if and when we are advised of another yorktown distribution after this form k is filed  we will timely report such on a form k 
our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
prospective information see page four of this report for a table that illustrates the status of our current coal contracts 
liquidity and capital resources for we generated million in cash from operations which enabled us to reduce our bank debt by million  invest million in the carlisle mine  buy land for about million for the allerton project and pay a special dividend of million 
for we are scheduled to extinguish our bank debt in december and we anticipate our capital expenditures for the carlisle mine falling to million 
we expect next year s cash from operations to be lower due to the non recurring gain of million 
future cash flow from operations could be negatively impacted depending on the final outcome of our contract negotiations as discussed on page four of this report 
our cash flow from operations will also be negatively impacted by payments of state and federal income taxes 
we do not anticipate any liquidity issues in the foreseeable future 
eventually  when we develop a new reserve  we intend to incur additional debt and restructure our existing credit facility 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
during may we declared our first cash dividend of per common share of which there were  outstanding 
furthermore  our board approved that the dividend would also apply to the  outstanding rsus and to the  outstanding stock options on that date 
the total cash payment for all the outstanding securities was about million 
during may we declared another special dividend of per share 
as was done last year  the dividend also applied to our outstanding rsus and stock options 
the total cash payment for all the outstanding securities was about million 
we evaluated our cash position and capital requirements and decided to declare another special cash dividend of 
per share payable in april the total payment  which also covers our outstanding rsus and options  will be about million 
in late august we decided to drop the property insurance on our underground mining equipment 
we feel comfortable with this decision as such equipment is allocated among four mining units spread out over eight miles 
the historical cost of such equipment is about million 
project update new reserve unassigned allerton see page three of this report for a discussion of our allerton project 
msha reimbursements two of our major contracts allow us to pass on certain costs incurred resulting from changes in costs to comply with mandates issued by msha or other government agencies 
in late december  we submitted a report which was reviewed by an outside consulting firm engaged by our customers 
in january the two customers agreed to reimburse us about million for costs incurred by us during and during those years we were not able to accurately estimate what the ultimate outcome of these reimbursable costs would be so we did not record them until we were certain of the amounts and certain of collection 
such amounts were recorded during the first quarter of we submitted our incurred costs for in september of for million 
one of the customers paid million in february and we continue discussions with the other customer 
accounting recognition for these reimbursements will be made in oil and gas properties orri we have an orri of about on  acres and a orri on  acres in laramie county  wyoming 
this orri was obtained from leases we sold to sm energy company formerly st 
mary land nyse sm in october this is a niobrara oil shale play in the northern d j basin 
during  sm energy drilled a discovery well the atlas on this acreage 
through this well has produced  barrels of oil 
during three additional wells were drilled and completed on our acreage with mixed results 
it is uncertain how many more wills be drilled by sm 
for we received  from these orri s 
north dakota lease play patriots prospect we invested about million in a lease play located in slope  hettinger and stark counties of north dakota which resulted in the purchase of about  net acres of oil and gas leases 
on june   we signed a letter of intent with chesapeake energy corporation nyse chk to sell such acreage and on july   the deal closed 
chk purchased a working interest for million resulting in a pre tax gain of about million considering selling expenses and non executive employee bonuses  due to some post closing curative work about million of the gain was recognized during the fourth quarter 
we retained a working interest and an approximate average orri 
if and when a well is proposed  we expect to participate in the drilling 
results of operations for  we sold  tons at an average price of ton 
for we sold  tons at an average price of ton 
our average price for  based on our contracts  is expected to be about ton 
the other income is due to the msha reimbursements discussed above 
the other loss of  was attributable primarily to our participating in the drilling of a dry hole in michigan on a gas prospect developed by savoy 
our share of the dry hole was about million 
operating costs and expenses averaged ton in compared to in we expect such costs to average ton for the increase in dd a was due to additions to plant and equipment 
sg a increased primarily due to higher expenses related to the new allerton reserve  increases in certain salaries and increases in attending industry and investor conferences 
also we incurred higher curative costs to perfect our coal leases 
our effective tax rate for and was in the range and we expect such rate to be in the range for ownership in savoy savoy operates almost exclusively in michigan 
they have an interest in the trenton black river play in southern michigan 
they hold  gross acres about  net in hillsdale and lenawee counties 
during savoy drilled gross wells in this play of which were dry and were successful 
during savoy plans on drilling additional wells in the play 
drilling locations in this play are identified based on the evaluation of extensive d seismic shoots 
savoy operates their own wells and their working interest averages between and and their net revenue interest averages between and 
savoy s net daily oil production currently averages about barrels of oil and mcf of gas 
savoy has an interest in about wells net 
loe was about per barrel of oil 
savoy s proved reserves are stated below and also in note to the financial statements 
the pre tax savoy is a partnership present value of their future cash flows discounted at pv was about million 
investors should note that the above numbers are to the  our ownership in savoy is about so our share of the pv using sec prices would be about million 
the reserve report was prepared by netherland  sewell associates  inc nsai 
see note for the qualifications of nsai 
the reserve report was prepared by timothy lovseth  our full time geologist who has years of experience in the oil and gas industry 
mr 
lovseth has no ownership in savoy

since the carlisle mine has only been in production since february we do not have a long history to rely on 
the reserve estimates are used in the dd a calculation  in our impairment test and in our internal cash flow projections 
if these estimates turn out to be materially under or over stated  our dd a expense and impairment test may be affected 
furthermore  if our coal reserves are materially overstated our liquidity and stock price could be adversely affected 
we have analyzed our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
we identified our federal tax return and our indiana state tax return as major tax jurisdictions 
none of our corporate tax returns have been examined in the last ten years 
we were recently advised by the irs that they will perform an examination of our and tax returns  such exam is to commence in mid march we were also notified by indiana tax representatives that they will examine our tax returns  such exam is to commence this summer 
we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our consolidated financial position 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded 
our significant accounting policies are set forth in note to the financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements none of the recent fasb pronouncements will have any material effect on us
