b represents the available borrowing capacity as of december  under the company s facility discussed below 
amounts as of december  include the sum of million of unused borrowing capacity under the company s revolving credit facility  which was terminated in  discussed below  and the available borrowing capacity of million under the company s mercury receivables abl facility  which was terminated in  as described below 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million as of december   a decrease of million from million as of december  total debt as of december  and december   was million and million  respectively 
as a result  the company s net debt increased million in to million from million in brunswick s debt to capitalization ratio increased to percent as of december   from percent as of december   mainly resulting from a decline in shareholders equity caused by increased accumulated other comprehensive losses from remeasurement of the company s defined benefit plan obligations at december   partially offset by current year net earnings and reduced debt levels 
in march  the company entered into a five year  million secured  asset based borrowing facility facility 
borrowings under the facility are subject to the value of the borrowing base  consisting of certain accounts receivable and inventory of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
as of december   the borrowing base totaled million and available capacity totaled million  net of million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
the company has the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit under the facility 
the company had no borrowings under the facility as of december  the company pays a facility fee of to basis points per annum  which is adjusted based on a leverage ratio 
the facility fee was basis points per annum as of december  under the terms of the facility  the company has multiple borrowing options  including borrowing at a rate tied to adjusted libor plus a spread of to basis points  which is adjusted based on a leverage ratio 
the borrowing spread was basis points as of december  the company may also borrow at the highest of the following  plus a spread of to basis points  which is adjusted based on a leverage ratio basis points as of december   the federal funds rate plus percent  the prime rate established by jpmorgan chase bank  na  or the one month adjusted libor rate plus percent 
the company s borrowing capacity may also be affected by the fixed charge covenant included in the facility 
the covenant requires that the company maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of greater than  whenever unused borrowing capacity plus certain cash balances together representing availability falls below million 
as of december   the company had a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of  and therefore had full access to borrowing capacity available under the facility 
when the fixed charge covenant ratio is below  the company is required to maintain at least million of availability in order to be in compliance with the covenant 
consequently  the borrowing capacity is effectively reduced by million whenever the fixed charge covenant ratio falls below in may  the company entered into the mercury receivables abl facility with ge commercial distribution finance corporation gecdf 
this facility was terminated in in connection with entering into the new facility  described above 
at december   the company had no borrowings under this facility 
the amount of borrowing capacity available under this facility at december  was million 
prior to march  the company had a million secured  asset based revolving credit facility revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks through may this facility was terminated in in connection with entering into the new facility  described above 
there were no loan borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  the amount of borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was million as of december  management believes that the company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet the company s short term and long term needs 
during  the company has continued to reduce its outstanding debt and will continue to identify ways to opportunistically retire debt in the company s notes  which totaled million at december   represent the only significant long term debt maturity until management expects that the company s near term operating cash requirements will be met out of existing cash and marketable securities balances and free cash flow 
specifically  the company expects to increase net earnings in when compared with net earnings in as a result of increasing sales 
the company plans to increase capital expenditures in to approximately million compared with million in  in an effort to develop and introduce new products to its current portfolio and to capitalize on immediate growth opportunities  while funding future growth initiatives

financial services the company  through its brunswick financial services corporation bfs subsidiary  owns a percent interest in a joint venture  brunswick acceptance company  llc bac 
cdf ventures  llc cdfv  a subsidiary of ge capital corporation gecc  owns the remaining percent 
bac commenced operations in and provides secured wholesale inventory floor plan financing to brunswick s boat and engine dealers 
bac also purchased and serviced a portion of mercury marine s domestic accounts receivable relating to its boat builder and dealer customers  but this program was terminated in may the term of the bac joint venture extends through june  the joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or the purchase of the other party s interest in the joint venture at the end of its term 
alternatively  either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term 
in march  the company and cdfv amended the joint venture agreement to conform the financial covenant contained in that agreement to the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test contained in the facility  as described above 
compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio test under the joint venture agreement is only required when the company s availability under the facility  as described above  is below million 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under both the joint venture agreement and the facility 
bac is funded in part through a billion secured borrowing facility from ge commercial distribution finance corporation gecdf  which is in place through the term of the joint venture  and with equity contributions from both partners 
bac also sells a portion of its receivables to a securitization facility  the ge dealer floorplan master note trust  which is arranged by gecc 
the sales of these receivables meet the requirements of a true sale and are therefore not retained on the financial statements of bac 
the indebtedness of bac is not guaranteed by the company or any of its subsidiaries 
in addition  bac is not responsible for any continuing servicing costs or obligations with respect to the securitized receivables 
bfs and gecdf have an income sharing arrangement related to income generated from the receivables sold by bac to the securitization facility 
the company records this income in other expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company considers bfs s investment in bac as an investment in a variable interest entity of which the company is not the primary beneficiary 
to be considered as the primary beneficiary  the company must have the power to direct the activities of bac that most significantly impact bac s economic performance and the company must have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from bac that could potentially be significant to bac 
based on a qualitative analysis performed by the company  bfs did not meet the definition of a primary beneficiary 
as a result  bfs s investment in bac is accounted for by the company under the equity method and is recorded as a component of equity investments in its consolidated balance sheets 
the company records bfs s share of income or loss in bac based on its ownership percentage in the joint venture in equity loss in its consolidated statements of operations 
bfs s equity investment is adjusted monthly to maintain a percent interest in accordance with the capital provisions of the joint venture agreement 
the company funds its investment in bac through cash contributions and reinvested earnings 
bfs s total investment in bac at december  and was million and million  respectively 
bfs recorded income related to the operations of bac of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this income includes amounts earned by bfs under the aforementioned income sharing agreement  but excludes the discount expense paid by the company in on the sale of mercury marine s accounts receivable to the joint venture as discussed in note financial services in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees 
the company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with guarantees and repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances 
historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant 
see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of these arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years contractual obligations debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases capital leases purchase obligations deferred management compensation other tax liabilities other long term liabilities total contractual obligations see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s debt 
debt refers to future cash principal payments 
see note leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s operating and capital leases 
purchase obligations represent agreements with suppliers and vendors at the end of for raw materials and other supplies as part of the normal course of business 
amounts primarily represent long term deferred compensation plans for company management 
payments are assumed to be equal to the remaining liability 
represents the expected cash obligations related to the company s liability for uncertain income tax positions 
as of december   the company s total liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  other than the items included in the table above  the company was unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
other long term liabilities include amounts recorded as secured obligations for lease and other long term receivables originated by the company and assigned to third parties where the transfer of assets do not meet the conditions for a sale as a result of the company s contingent obligation to repurchase the receivables in the event of customer non payment 
amounts above also include obligations under deferred revenue arrangements and future projected payments related to the company s nonqualified pension plans 
other long term liabilities also include million of required qualified pension plan contributions to be paid in  as well as million of scheduled retiree health care and life insurance benefit plan payments 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential future cash outflows associated with these plans  the company is unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts and periods in which any additional liabilities might be paid 
legal proceedings see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to certain legal and environmental proceedings 
environmental regulations in its marine engine segment  brunswick continues to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements 
the costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on marine engine segment operating margins and may affect short term operating results 
the state of california adopted regulations that required catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment systems on sterndrive and inboard engines that became effective on january  the epa adopted similar environmental regulations governing engine sales  effective january  other environmental regulatory bodies in the united states and other countries may also impose higher emissions standards than are currently in effect for those regions 
the company complies with current regulations regarding emissions and expects to comply fully with any new regulations  but compliance will increase the cost of these products for the company and the industry 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on brunswick s competitive position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
the company has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on brunswick s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
brunswick s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats  marine engines  marine parts and accessories  fitness equipment  bowling products  bowling retail activities and billiards tables 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions  rebates and manufacturer coupons that are recorded as reductions of revenues in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of when the program has been communicated to the customer or at the time of sale 
revenues from freight are included as a part of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations  whereas shipping  freight and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
the company also provides a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivable for brunswick s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated considering the customer s financial position and product purchase volumes 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectability of a specific account or note 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
restructuring and exit activities 
from time to time  the company engages in actions associated with cost reduction initiatives 
the company s restructuring actions require significant estimates including a expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  b remaining lease obligations  including sublease income  and c other exit costs 
the company has accrued amounts that it believes are its best estimates of the obligations it expects to incur in connection with these actions  but these estimates are subject to change due to market conditions and final negotiations 
should the actual amounts differ from the originally estimated amounts  the company s earnings could decrease 
the company recognized million  million and million in restructuring  exit and impairment charges in  and  respectively  which are discussed in more detail in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets primarily result from business acquisitions 
the excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the company reviews these assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the reporting units with goodwill balances are the company s fitness and marine engine segments 
during  the company early adopted an amendment to the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the accounting standards codification asc 
the company determined through its qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than their carrying values 
as a result  the company was not required to perform the two step impairment test described below 
for and  the impairment test for goodwill was a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in this second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and the guideline public company method 
the income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach utilizing a gordon growth model 
internally forecasted future cash flows  which the company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions  are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate developed for each reporting unit 
the discount rate is developed using market observable inputs  as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit s forecasted performance 
fair value under the guideline public company method is determined by applying market multiples for that reporting unit s comparable public companies to the unit s financial results 
the key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in a reporting unit s forecasted future performance  including revenue growth and operating margins  as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts  and selecting representative market multiples 
the company s primary intangible assets are customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations 
the costs of amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives  typically between three and fifteen years  to their estimated residual values using the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long lived assets described below 
intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of trade names is measured using a relief from royalty approach  which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company 
higher royalty rates are assigned to premium brands within the marketplace based on name recognition and profitability  while other brands receive lower royalty rates 
the basis for future cash flow projections is internal revenue forecasts by brand  which the company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions  to which the selected royalty rate is applied 
these future cash flows are discounted using the applicable discount rate  which considers the annual goodwill impairment testing process noted above  as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset 
the key uncertainties in this calculation are the selection of an appropriate royalty rate and assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth forecasts  as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in developing the discount rate 
long lived assets 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived trade names  and other long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
once an impairment indicator is identified  the company tests for recoverability of the related asset group using an estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the remaining asset group s life 
in the event that an asset group s carrying value is not recoverable  the company records an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over the long lived asset group s fair value 
fair value is determined using observable inputs  including the use of appraisals from independent third parties  when available  and  when observable inputs are not available  based on the company s assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  based on the best information available in the circumstances 
specifically  the company used discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of the asset when observable inputs were unavailable 
the company tested its long lived asset balances for impairment as indicators presented themselves during  and  resulting in impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  which are recognized in restructuring  exit and impairment charges and selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
environmental 
the company accrues for environmental remediation related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized 
in light of existing reserves  the company s environmental claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience  which incorporate anticipated exposure for losses incurred  but not yet reported 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
postretirement benefit reserves 
postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions  including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company evaluates the realizability of net deferred tax assets and  as necessary  records valuation allowances against them 
the company estimates its tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation 
the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s application of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the company s tax rate and deferred tax balances to increase or decrease

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange rate exposure related to anticipated transactions  and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  british pound  australian dollar  swedish krona  norwegian krone  new zealand dollar and hungarian forint 
the company hedges anticipated transactions with financial instruments whose maturity date  along with the realized gain or loss  occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction 
the company manages foreign currency exposure of assets or liabilities through the use of derivative financial instruments such that the gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument offsets the loss or gain recognized on the asset or liability  respectively 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements  futures contracts and supplier agreements to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials  including aluminum  copper and natural gas 
in the third quarter of  the company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of million to hedge the interest rate risk associated with an anticipated debt issuance in to refinance the company s senior notes due in the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and interest rate risk as it relates to its derivative financial instruments 
the company uses a model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and commodity prices 
for options and instruments with nonlinear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company would incur on its derivative financial instruments from a percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates
