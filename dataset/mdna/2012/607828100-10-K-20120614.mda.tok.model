item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview and strategic plan founded in  modine manufacturing company is a worldwide leader in thermal management systems and components  bringing heating and cooling technology and solutions to diversified global markets 
we operate on five continents  in countries  and with approximately  employees worldwide 
our products are in light  medium and heavy duty vehicles  commercial heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac equipment  refrigeration systems and off highway and industrial equipment 
our broad product offerings include heat transfer modules and packages  radiators  oil coolers  charge air coolers  vehicular air conditioning  building hvac equipment  and egr coolers 

table of contents consolidated strategy our goal is to grow profitably as a leading global provider of thermal management technology to a broad range of niche on highway  off highway  industrial and building hvac end markets 
we expect to achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and selective acquisitions 
we focus on development of new products and technologies for diverse geographic and end markets  a rigorous strategic planning and corporate development process  and operational and financial discipline to ensure improved profitability and long term stability 
development of new products and technologies our ability to develop new products and technologies for current and potential customers and for new and emerging markets is one of our competitive strengths 
we own two global  state of the art technology centers  dedicated to the development and testing of products and technologies 
the centers are located in racine  wisconsin in the us  and in bonlanden  germany 
our reputation for providing high quality products and technologies has been a company strength valued by customers  and has led to a history with relatively few product warranty issues 
in fiscal  we spent million representing approximately percent of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses on our product and technology research and development efforts 
we continue to benefit from relationships with customers that recognize the value of having us participate directly in product design  development and validation 
this has resulted and should continue to result in strong  longer term customer relationships with companies that value partnerships with their suppliers 
in the past several years  our product lines have been under price pressure from increased global competition  primarily from asia and other low cost areas 
at the same time  many of our products containing higher technology have helped us better manage demands from customers for lower prices 
many of our technologies are proprietary  difficult to replicate and patent protected 
we have been granted and or acquired more than  patents on our technologies and work diligently to protect our intellectual property 
strategic planning and corporate development we employ both short term one year and longer term five to seven year strategic planning processes  enabling us to continually assess our opportunities  competitive threats  and economic market challenges 
we focus on strengthening our competitive position through strategic  global business development activities 
we continuously look for and take advantage of opportunities to advance our position as a global leader  by expanding our geographic footprint and by expanding into new end markets and product areas all with a focus on thermal management technologies 
this process allows us to identify product gaps in the marketplace  develop new products and make additional investments to fill those gaps 
an example of our recent success from this process has been our organic expansion activities into niche hvac and refrigeration markets in our commercial products segment 
operational and financial discipline we operate in an increasingly competitive global marketplace  therefore  we must manage our business with a disciplined focus on increasing productivity and reducing waste 
the competitiveness of the global market place requires us to move toward a greater manufacturing scale in order to create a more competitive cost base 
as costs for materials and purchased parts rise from time to time due to global increases in the commodity markets  we seek low cost country sourcing when appropriate and enter into contracts with some of our customers that provide for these rising costs to be passed through to them on a lag basis 
we follow a rigorous financial process for investment and returns  intended to enable increased profitability and cash flows over the long term 
particular emphasis is given to working capital improvement and prioritization of capital for investment and disposals  driving past and current improvement in global cash and debt management and access to sufficient credit 

table of contents our executive management incentive compensation annual cash incentive plan for fiscal was based on a return on average capital employed roace and improvement in economic profit  driving our singular focus on alignment of management interests with shareholders interests in our capital allocation and asset management decisions 
in addition  we maintain a long term incentive compensation plan for officers and certain key employees that is used to attract  retain and motivate key employees who directly impact the long term performance of the company 
the plan initiated in fiscal is comprised of stock options  retention restricted stock awards and performance stock awards  which are based on a three year average roace and a target improvement in economic profit at the end of the three year period fiscal  with each weighted at percent 
consolidated market conditions and trends during fiscal  the company reported revenues from continuing operations of billion  a percent increase from billion in fiscal the company s end markets showed improvement from the deep recession experienced during and this improvement was seen across most of modine s end markets  including the commercial vehicle and off highway markets 
the commercial hvac markets showed modest market demand growth 
the company s business volumes improved in fiscal and are close to the pre recessionary annual sales of billion reported in fiscal the original equipment manufacturer oem marketplace is extremely competitive and our customers demand that we continue to provide high quality products as well as annual price decreases 
from time to time  we also experience volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and in the costs of our purchased parts and raw materials particularly aluminum  copper  steel  and stainless steel nickel 
the combination of these factors impacts our profitability 
segment information strategy  market conditions and trends each of our business segments is managed at the vice president or managing director level with separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
these results are used to evaluate the performance of each business segment  and make decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses 
our chief operating decision makers evaluate segment performance with an emphasis on gross margin  and secondarily on operating income of each segment  which includes certain allocations of corporate sg a expenses 
original equipment europe percent of fiscal revenues our european operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain and engine cooling systems  as well as vehicular climate control components to various end markets  including automotive  heavy duty and industrial  commercial vehicle  bus and off highway oems 
these systems include cooling modules  radiators  charge air coolers  oil cooling products  egr products  retarder and transmission cooling components and hvac condensers 
fiscal sales increased primarily in the commercial vehicle  off highway and industrial markets 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was relatively consistent with the prior year due to new program ramp up inefficiencies and higher material costs 
the macro european economy is softening with low to stagnant growth 
we maintain our focus on continuous improvement by the deployment of the modine operating system  low cost country sourcing and cost containment 
the asset base is large and we are seeing lower returns on that asset base 
our goal is to improve the return on assets by taking restructuring actions similar to those that were completed in the original equipment north america segment  which we expect to commence in fiscal production volumes are increasing in our facilities within hungary 
we expect our european business to benefit from our various technology initiatives  which allow us to distinguish ourselves from competitors in the eyes of our customers 
we also expect this segment to continue to gain market share in the commercial vehicle and off highway segments as we focus on these strategically important markets and deemphasize our focus on automotive modules 
the business is negatively impacted by rising material prices  at least until these rising prices are offset by material pass through agreements on a time lag 
we also expect to continue to see price reduction demands from our customers along with continuous and ongoing increased customer service expectations and competition from low cost country competitors 

table of contents at the same time  the business is strongly positioned with a solid customer reputation for technology  service and program management  and has been successful in winning additional program awards  particularly in the commercial vehicle market  that are scheduled to begin production in the calendar time frame 
original equipment north america percent of fiscal revenues our original equipment north america segment includes products and technologies that are found on vehicles made for the on highway markets  commercial vehicle oems and automotive components  including class trucks  school buses  transit buses  motor homes  motor coaches and light trucks 
it also serves the off highway markets including agricultural  construction and industrial products eg lift trucks  compressors and power generation 
continued strength of the commercial vehicle  agriculture and construction markets resulted in strong revenue and operational results in fiscal the restructuring plan for the segment was completed with the closure of the camdenton  missouri facility 
the manufacturing footprint consolidation and fixed cost reduction efforts over the past five years continued to provide operating leverage as volumes remained firm 
the north american business will continue to focus on growing in the markets where its products and manufacturing footprint create a competitive advantage 
the overall strategy for this business segment includes the following reducing lead times to bring new products to market and offering a wider product breadth  while at the same time rationalizing the existing product lines to meet required financial metrics or fit within our overall strategy 
pursuing only selected new business opportunities that meet our minimum targeted rates of return  thus enabling profitable growth to the company 
expanding the product and market focus in order to leverage the competitive cost structure 
south america percent of fiscal revenues our south america segment provides heat exchange products to a variety of markets in the domestic brazilian market as well as for export to north america and europe 
this business provides products to the on highway commercial vehicle markets  off highway markets  including construction and agricultural applications  automotive oems and industrial applications  primarily for power generation systems 
this business also provides products to the brazilian  north american and european aftermarkets for both automotive and commercial applications 
we manufacture radiators  charge air coolers  oil coolers  auxiliary coolers transmission  hydraulic  and power steering  engine cooling modules and hvac system modules 
we experienced a softening in sales within this segment after december due to the pre buy of commercial vehicles ahead of the january  change in emissions standards 
there is a continued trend in brazil with customers moving away from copper based products and shifting to aluminum 
we are transitioning our manufacturing facility to ensure we have the necessary capability to supply our current and future customers as they transition to aluminum based products 
even with the transition  this segment generated acceptable operating returns 
growth drivers in this region include the development of additional agricultural land and infrastructure improvements in brazil as well as the increasing regulatory focus on energy efficiency and environmental emissions 
commercial products percent of fiscal revenues our commercial products business manufactures and distributes a variety of hvac products  primarily for commercial building and related applications in north america  europe  asia and south africa 
we sell our heating and cooling products through various channels to consulting contractors  engineers  and building owners for applications such as warehouses  repair garages  greenhouses  residential garages  schools  computer rooms  manufacturing facilities  banks  pharmaceutical companies  stadiums and retail stores 

table of contents our heating products include gas  electric  oil and hydronic unit heaters  low intensity infrared  and large roof mounted direct and indirect fired makeup air units 
our cooling products include single packaged vertical units and unit ventilators used in school room applications  precision air conditioning units  air and water cooled chillers  ceiling cassettes  and roof top packaged ventilation units used in a variety of commercial building applications 
we have recently introduced a number of new products  including atheriontm  a packaged roof top ventilation system  which we began shipping in fiscal commercial products is our highest returning business and we have experienced above market growth over the past few years 
we intend to continue to invest in this business in order to capitalize on its higher returns 
we will pursue both organic and inorganic growth including the recently announced plans to acquire geofinity manufacturing inc geofinity 
this acquisition will provide a full line of innovative geothermal heat pumps in both water to water and water to air models 
geofinity will extend modine s current geothermal heat pump product range beyond airedale branded school only applications to a wider market  one which has grown at a rate of nearly percent annually 
we expect that this acquisition will help us to expand our offerings to the growing commercial hvac business while extending our focus on the residential market 
revenues improved from the prior year due to modest market demand growth and increased market share in certain segments 
gross margins remained relatively flat from prior year as a percentage of sales despite significant commodity cost increases 
we offset these cost increases with price increases and through improved manufacturing productivity 
economic conditions  such as demand for new commercial construction  growth in data centers  and school renovations  as well as higher efficiency demands are growth drivers for the heating and cooling products 
original equipment asia percent of fiscal revenues our asian operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain cooling systems and engine products to customers in commercial vehicle and off highway markets 
modine technology  performance  quality and reputation enabled us to win new engine products business in asia 
emissions standards in china and india lag behind europe and north america 
as a result  some local on and off highway powertrain cooling customers focus on price versus technology 
however  we are seeing a shift in these markets towards higher performing  durable products  which may provide us additional powertrain cooling opportunities in the future 
many components that we supply in this region become part of a module  which increases the amount of our content on an engine 
our strategy in this business segment is to control and reduce costs  secure new business  further diversify our product offering and customer base  and continue to focus on building manufacturing capabilities in china and india to serve the region in a cost competitive manner 
our manufacturing facility in chennai  india is currently producing low volumes of products and our manufacturing facility in changzhou  china is continuing to ramp up production 
at the same time  we are transforming our light assembly facility in shanghai  china into an engine products focused manufacturing facility and expect the transformation to be completed during fiscal we are scheduled to begin production of several new products from these three facilities during fiscal our objective is to accelerate growth and achieve profitability in this segment 
we are positioned to take on new programs and are looking to increase the utilization of the manufacturing facilities 
outlook in fiscal we expect weaker economic conditions in several key markets  including europe  south america  and asia 
also  we expect approximately million of planned program reductions due to the wind down of our bmw business in europe and asia  along with certain automotive and military programs winding down in north america 
these factors  as well as  unfavorable foreign exchange impacts result in an outlook of a to percent year over year decrease in net sales compared with our fiscal results 
we plan to begin to implement a restructuring program designed to align the cost structure and manufacturing base in europe with a strategic focus on the commercial vehicle market 
we expect the impact of the sales volume declines in fiscal will result in operating income in a range of to percent of sales  excluding the impact of the european restructuring 
further  we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to  excluding the impact of the european restructuring 

table of contents consolidated results of operations continuing operations in fiscal  we achieved a roace of percent  which represents a substantial improvement from the percent roace in fiscal and from the negative returns generated during the economic recession 
fiscal sales volumes improved as our end markets continued to recover from the economic recession 
fiscal sales volumes and profitability improved significantly from the prior year as our end markets showed strong recovery from the economic recession

settlement of derivative contracts the company entered into futures contracts related to forecasted purchases of aluminum and copper that are treated as cash flow hedges 
unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and recognized as a component of earnings at the same time that the underlying purchases of aluminum and copper impact earnings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the futures contracts entered into for aluminum within the original equipment north america segment became ineffective

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an unrealized gain of million within cost of sales related to the futures contracts deemed ineffective 
during fiscal  million of expense was recorded in cost of sales related to the settlement of certain futures contracts 
during fiscal  the amount of expense recorded in cost of sales related to the settlement of certain futures contracts was negligible

these contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges  therefore  resulting gains and losses are recorded directly in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  million of expense was recorded in other expense income net related to these foreign currency forward contracts 
gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are offset by gains and losses recorded on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  the company entered into forward starting swaps related to a private placement debt offering 
when the fixed interest rate of the private placement borrowing was locked  the company terminated and settled the forward starting swaps at a loss

accordingly  the loss was reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and were being amortized to interest expense over the life of the borrowings 
in conjunction with the repayment of the then existing senior notes in fiscal  the remaining unamortized balance for these interest rate derivatives of million was reflected as a component of interest expense 
research and development we focus our r d efforts on solutions that meet the most current and pressing heat transfer needs  as well as the anticipated future heat transfer needs  of oems and other customers within the commercial vehicle  construction  agricultural and commercial hvac industries and  more selectively  within the automotive industry 
our products and systems typically are aimed at solving difficult and complex heat transfer challenges requiring advanced thermal management 
the typical demands are for products and systems that are lighter weight  more compact  more efficient and more durable in nature to meet ever increasing customer standards as customers work to ensure compliance with increasingly stringent global emissions and energy efficiency requirements 
our company s heritage includes depth and breadth of expertise in thermal management that  combined with our global manufacturing presence  standardized processes  and state of the art technical centers and wind tunnels  enables us to rapidly bring customized solutions to customers at the best value

consistent with the streamlining of the company s product portfolio  our current research is focused primarily on company sponsored development in the areas of powertrain cooling  engine products  and residential and commercial hvac products 
recent r d projects have included development of waste heat recovery systems for major us based engine and truck manufacturers in conjunction with the us department of energy to help these manufacturers meet ever increasing demands for emissions reduction  while simultaneously improving powertrain efficiency and  thus  fuel economy  next generation aluminum radiators for the commercial vehicle  agricultural and constructions markets  and egr technology  which enables our customers to efficiently meet tighter regulatory emissions standards 

table of contents through our proactive r d  we are developing new technologies designed to keep our customers within federal and international guidelines and regulations well into the future 
we continue to identify  evaluate and engage in external research projects that complement strategic internal research initiatives  some of which are government sponsored  in order to further leverage the company s significant thermal technology expertise and capability 
modine has been granted more than  worldwide patents over the life of the company 
modine is focused on the long term commercialization of our intellectual property and research  and believes that these investments will result in new and next generation products and technologies 
critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements 
application of these policies results in accounting estimates that have the greatest potential for a significant impact on modine s financial statements 
the following discussion of these judgments and estimates is intended to supplement the significant accounting policies presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including agreed upon commodity price increases  as products are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers 
the revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for sales rebates  volume incentives  and returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debts and warranty expense 
the company bases these estimates on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
the company recognizes revenue from various licensing agreements when earned except in those cases where collection is uncertain  or the amount cannot reasonably be estimated until formal accounting reports are received from the licensee 
contractual commodity price increases may also be included in revenue 
price increases agreed upon in advance are recognized as revenue when the products are shipped to our customers 
in certain situations  the price increases are recognized as revenue at the time products are shipped in accordance with the contractual arrangements with our customers  but are offset by appropriate provisions for estimated commodity price increases that may ultimately not be collected 
these provisions are established based on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
there was no provision for estimated commodity price increases at march  and impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets with finite lives and equity investments  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
the company considers factors such as operating losses  declining outlooks and market capitalization when evaluating the necessity for an impairment analysis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  or the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
fair market value is estimated in various ways depending on the nature of the assets under review 
this value can be based on appraised value  estimated salvage value  sales price under negotiation or estimated cancellation charges  as applicable 
the most significant long lived assets that have been subject to impairment evaluations are the company s net property  plant and equipment  which totaled million at march  within property  plant and equipment  the most significant assets evaluated are buildings and improvements  and machinery and equipment 
the company evaluates impairment at the lowest level of separately identifiable cash flows  which is generally at the manufacturing plant level 
the company monitors its manufacturing plant performance to determine whether indicators exist that would require an impairment evaluation for the facility 
this includes significant adverse changes in plant profitability metrics  substantial changes in the mix of customer programs manufactured in the plant  consisting of new program launches  reductions  and phase outs  and shifting of programs to other facilities under the company s manufacturing realignment strategy 
when such indicators are present  the company performs an impairment evaluation by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated in the manufacturing facility to the net book value of the long lived assets within that facility 
the undiscounted cash flows are estimated based on the expected future cash flows to be generated by the manufacturing facility over the remaining useful life of the machinery and equipment within that facility 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value of the long lived assets  such assets are written down to fair market value  which is generally estimated based on appraisals or estimated salvage value 

table of contents the majority of the long lived asset impairment charges during fiscal  and have been recorded within the company s original equipment europe and original equipment north america segments 
these segments had program phase outs and cancellations  many of which were in the automotive markets 
further unanticipated adverse changes in these segments could result in the need to perform additional impairment evaluations in the future 
the company s cost and operational efficiency measures  which are designed to attain a more competitive cost base and improve the company s longer term competitiveness reduces the risk of potential long lived asset impairment charges in the future 
the manufacturing realignment strategy of this plan was designed to improve the utilization of the company s facilities  with fewer facilities  but operating at higher capacities 
the portfolio rationalization strategy of this plan was designed to identify products where the company can earn a sufficient return on its investment  and divest or exit products that do not meet required metrics 
recent portfolio rationalization actions include de emphasis on automotive module business  primarily within europe 
these strategies create better facility utilization and greater profitability in product mix  which allow the manufacturing facilities to withstand more significant adverse changes before an impairment charge is necessary 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment tests are conducted at least annually unless business events or other conditions exist that would require a more frequent evaluation 
the company considers factors such as operating losses  declining outlooks and market capitalization when evaluating the necessity for an impairment analysis 
in fiscal  the annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment was conducted in the fourth quarter resulting in no impairment charge 
any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value results in an impairment charge 
the recoverability of goodwill is determined by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates 
the assessment of the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives is based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows of the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income are considered as well as business trends and market conditions 
to the extent that book value exceeds the fair value  an impairment is recognized 
at march   the company had goodwill of million recorded which was primarily comprised of million within the south america segment and million within the commercial products segment 
the south america segment reported operating income of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the commercial products segment reported operating income of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the future discounted cash flows of these segments continue to exceed their carrying value indicating that the goodwill recorded in these segments is fully realizable at march  if  in future periods  these segments experience a significant unanticipated economic downturn in the markets in which they operate  this would require an impairment review 
warranty estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time of the sale and recorded in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based on the best information available  which includes using statistical and analytical analysis of both historical and current claim data 
original estimates  accrued at the time of sale  are adjusted when it becomes probable that expected claims will differ materially from these initial estimates 

table of contents tooling costs pre production tooling costs incurred by the company in manufacturing products under various customer programs are capitalized as a component of property  plant and equipment  net of any customer reimbursements  when the company retains title to the tooling 
these costs are amortized over a three year period and are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
for customer owned tooling costs incurred by the company  a receivable is recorded when the customer has guaranteed reimbursement to the company 
the reimbursement period may vary by program and customer 
no significant arrangements existed during the years ended march  and where customer owned tooling costs were not accompanied by guaranteed reimbursements 
pensions and postretirement benefits plans the calculation of the expense and liabilities of modine s pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions include the discount rate  long term expected return on plan assets  and future trends in healthcare costs 
the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
these differences may impact future pension or postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities 
the company replaced the existing domestic defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan for salaried paid employees hired on or after january  the modine manufacturing company pension plan for non hourly factory and salaried employees was modified so that no service performed for salaried employees after march  would be counted when calculating an employee s years of credited service under the pension plan formula and no increases in annual earnings for salaried employees after december  would be included in calculating the average annual portion under the pension plan formula 
the plan was further modified so that no increases in annual earnings and no service performed for non union hourly factory employees after december  will be included in calculating the average annual earnings and years of credit service under the pension plan formula 
we believe the current defined contribution plan for domestic employees will  in general  allow the company a greater degree of flexibility in managing retirement benefit costs on a long term basis 
for the following discussion regarding sensitivity of assumptions  all amounts presented are in reference to the domestic pension plans since the domestic plans comprise percent of the company s total benefit plan assets and the large majority of the company s pension plan expense 
to determine the expected rate of return  modine considers such factors as a the actual return earned on plan assets  b historical rates of returns on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  c projections of returns on those asset classes  d the amount of active management of the assets  e capital market conditions and economic forecasts  and f administrative expenses covered by the plan assets 
the long term rate of return utilized in fiscal and fiscal was percent and percent  respectively 
for fiscal  the company has assumed a rate of percent 
the impact of a basis point decrease in the expected rate of return on assets would result in a million increase in fiscal pension expense 
the discount rate reflects rates available on long term  high quality fixed income corporate bonds  reset annually on the measurement date of march for fiscal  the company used a discount rate of percent  reflecting a decrease from percent in fiscal the company based this decision on a yield curve that was created following an analysis of the projected cash flows from the affected plans 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
changing modine s discount rate by basis points would impact the fiscal domestic pension expense by approximately million 
a key determinant in the amount of the postretirement benefit obligation and expense is the healthcare cost trend rate 
the healthcare trend rate for fiscal year was percent  and the company expects this to be percent for fiscal this rate is projected to decline gradually to percent in fiscal year and remain at that level thereafter 
an annual cap that was established for most retiree healthcare and life insurance plans between fiscal and limits modine s liability 
beginning in february  the company discontinued providing postretirement benefits for salaried and non union employees hired on or after that date 
furthermore  effective january   the plan was modified to eliminate coverage for retired participants that are medicare eligible 
a one percent increase in the healthcare trend rate would result in no substantial increase in postretirement expense and an increase in postretirement benefit obligations of approximately million 

table of contents other loss reserves the company has a number of other loss exposures  such as environmental and product liability claims  regulatory compliance  litigation  self insurance reserves  recoverability of deferred income tax benefits  and accounts receivable loss reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment to determine the risk exposure and ultimate potential liability 
the company estimates these reserve requirements by using consistent and suitable methodologies for the particular type of loss reserve being calculated

forward looking statements this report  including  but not limited to  the discussion under outlook under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains statements  including information about future financial performance  accompanied by phrases such as believes  estimates  expects  plans  anticipates  intends  and other similar forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of modine s actual results  performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements  because of certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors in item a 
in part i 
in this report 
other risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following operational risks the efficient deployment of resources to meet increasing demand for the company s products  the impact of operational inefficiencies as a result of program launches and product transfers  modine s ability to maintain current programs and compete effectively for new business  including its ability to offset or otherwise address increasing pricing pressures from its competitors and price reduction pressures from its customers  costs and other effects of the remediation of environmental contamination  modine s ability to obtain profitable business at its facilities in the low cost countries of china  hungary  mexico and india and to meet quality standards with products produced at these facilities  modine s ability to successfully implement restructuring plans and drive cost reductions and increased profitability and return on assets as a result  unanticipated delays or modifications initiated by major customers with respect to product applications or requirements  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  including unanticipated launch challenges and warranty claims  the possibility that other or more significant issues may be identified in applying vat in the original equipment europe segment  increasingly complex and restrictive government regulations  work stoppages or interference at modine s facilities or those of its major customers and or suppliers  and costs and other effects of unanticipated litigation or claims  and the increasing pressures associated with rising healthcare and insurance costs 
market risks economic  social and political conditions  changes and challenges in the markets where modine operates and competes  including currency exchange rate fluctuations particularly the value of the euro relative to the us dollar  tariffs  inflation  changes in interest rates  recession  and restrictions associated with importing and exporting and foreign ownership  
table of contents the impact on modine of increases in commodity prices  particularly modine s exposure to the changing prices of aluminum  copper  steel and stainless steel nickel  unanticipated problems with suppliers meeting modine s time  quality and price demands  modine s ability or inability to pass increasing commodity prices on to customers as well as the inherent lag in timing of such pass through pricing  and the impact of environmental laws and regulations on modine s business and the business of modine s customers  including modine s ability to take advantage of opportunities to supply alternative new technologies to meet environmental emissions standards 
financial risks modine s ability to fund its liquidity requirements and meet its long term commitments in the event of any renewed disruption in the credit markets  and modine s ability to realize future tax benefits 
in addition to the risks set forth above  modine is subject to other risks and uncertainties identified by the company in public filings with the us securities and exchange commission 
modine does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  modine is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices  credit risk and economic conditions 
foreign currency risk modine is subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to its operations in foreign countries 
modine has manufacturing facilities in brazil  china  mexico  south africa  india and throughout europe 
it also has an equity investment in a japanese company and a joint venture in south korea 
modine sells and distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company manufactures  distributes and sells its products 
the company attempts to mitigate foreign currency risks on transactions with customers and suppliers in foreign countries by entering into contracts that are denominated in the functional currency of the modine entity engaging in the contract 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro  and changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the company s foreign subsidiaries reporting in local currencies are generally reported as a component of shareholders equity 
strengthening of the us dollar to other foreign currencies during fiscal  especially the euro and real  has led to a devaluing of the company s foreign results 
this devaluation is evident in the company s unfavorable currency translation adjustments of million recorded in fiscal in fiscal  the company experienced a general weakening of the us dollar to these foreign currencies  which resulted in a favorable currency translation adjustment of million 
as of march  and  the company s foreign subsidiaries had net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk of million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in the net current assets from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely all move in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

table of contents the company has  from time to time  certain foreign denominated  long term debt obligations and long term inter company loans that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
as of march  there were no third party foreign denominated  long term debt obligations sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the company has inter company loans outstanding at march  as follows million between two loans to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine thermal systems co changzhou  china  with various maturity dates through july  and million between two loans to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine thermal systems korea  with maturity dates in april  these inter company loans are sensitive to movement in foreign exchange rates  and the company did not have any derivative instruments that hedge this exposure at march  the company has  from time to time  entered into currency rate derivatives to manage the fluctuation in foreign exchange rate exposure on these loans 
these derivative instruments have typically not been treated as hedges  and accordingly  gains or losses on the derivatives are recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations and act to offset any currency movement on the outstanding loan receivable 
interest rate risk modine s interest rate risk policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates 
the company generally utilizes a mixture of debt maturities together with both fixed rate and floating rate debt to manage its exposure to interest rate variations related to its borrowings 
the domestic revolving credit facility is based on a variable interest rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus to basis points depending upon the company s consolidated total debt to consolidated adjusted ebitda ratio leverage ratio the four preceding fiscal quarters 
as of march   the company s variable interest rate was libor plus basis points or percent 
the company is subject to future fluctuations in libor and changes in its leverage ratio  which would affect the variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility and create variability in interest expense 
a basis point increase in libor would increase interest expense by million based on the march  revolving credit facility balance 
the company has  from time to time  entered into interest rate derivatives to manage variability in interest rates 
these interest rate derivatives were treated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
accordingly  the losses were reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and were being amortized to interest expense over the life of the borrowings 
during fiscal  million of expense was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the amortization of interest rate derivative losses  which includes the remaining unamortized balance of these interest rate derivatives of million in conjunction with the repayment of the company s then outstanding senior notes on august  during fiscal  million of expense was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the amortization of interest rate derivative losses  which includes million of amortization in proportion with the mandatory prepayment of the senior notes during the fiscal year related to the company s common stock offering 
there were no remaining net unrealized losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income at march  the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for our long term debt 
the fair value of the long term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities 
the book value of the debt approximates fair value  with the exception of the million fixed rate notes  which have a fair value of approximately million at march  
table of contents as of march   long term debt matures as follows years ending march expected maturity date dollars in thousands thereafter total fixed rate foreign denominated average interest rate variable rate foregin denominated average interest rate fixed rate us dollars average interest rate variable rate us dollars average interest rate credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payment according to contract terms 
the company s principal credit risk consists of outstanding trade receivables 
prior to granting credit  the company evaluates each customer  taking into consideration the customer s financial condition  payment experience and credit information 
after credit is granted  the company actively monitors the customer s financial condition and developing business news 
approximately percent of the trade receivables balance at march  was concentrated with the company s top ten customers 
these customers operate primarily in the automotive  truck and heavy equipment markets and are influenced by many of the same market and general economic factors 
modine s history of incurring credit losses from customers has not been material  and the company does not expect that trend to change 
the company manages credit risks through its focus on the following cash and investments cash deposits and short term investments are reviewed to ensure banks have credit ratings acceptable to the company and that all short term investments are maintained in secured or guaranteed instruments 
the company s holdings in cash and investments were considered stable and secure at march   pension assets the company has retained outside advisors to assist in the management of the assets in the company s defined benefit plans 
in making investment decisions  the company has been guided by an established risk management protocol that focuses on protection of the plan assets against downside risk 
the company ensures that investments within these plans provide appropriate diversification  are subject to monitoring of investment teams and ensure that portfolio managers adhere to the company s investment policies 
the company believes it has appropriate investment policies and controls and proactive investment advisors  and insurance the company monitors its insurance providers to ensure that they have acceptable financial ratings 
the company has not identified any concerns in this regard through its review 
economic risk economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world or significant downturns in markets that the company supplies 
the company sells a broad range of products that provide thermal solutions to a diverse group of customers operating primarily in the commercial vehicle  heavy equipment  automotive and commercial heating and air conditioning markets 
the company operates in diversified markets as a strategy for offsetting the risk associated with a downturn in any of the markets it serves 
however  risk associated with any market downturn  such as the global downturn experienced in fiscal and fiscal  is still present 
the company monitors economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
as modine expands its global presence  it also encounters risks imposed by potential trade restrictions  including tariffs  embargoes and the like 
the company continues to pursue non speculative opportunities to mitigate these economic risks  and capitalize  when possible  on changing market conditions 

table of contents the company pursues new market opportunities after careful consideration of the potential associated risks and benefits 
successes in new markets are dependent upon the company s ability to commercialize its investments 
current examples of new and emerging markets for modine include those related to waste heat recovery and expansion into the chinese and indian markets 
modine s investment in these areas is subject to the risks associated with business integration  technological success  customers and market acceptance  and modine s ability to meet the demands of its customers as these markets grow 
the company anticipates that continued recovery from the global recession and economic growth in china may put production pressure on certain of the company s suppliers of raw materials 
in particular  there are a limited number of suppliers of copper  steel and aluminum fin stock 
the company is exposed to the risk of supply of certain raw materials not being able to meet customer demand as suppliers may not increase their output capacity as quickly as customers increased their orders and of increased prices being charged by raw material suppliers 
in addition  the company purchases parts from suppliers that use the company s tooling to create the part 
in most instances  and for financial reasons  the company does not have duplicate tooling for the manufacture of its purchased parts 
as a result  the company is exposed to the risk of a supplier being unable to provide the quantity or quality of parts that the company requires 
even in situations where suppliers are manufacturing parts without the use of company tooling  the company faces the challenge of obtaining high quality parts from suppliers 
the company has implemented a supplier risk management program that utilizes inside and third party tools to identify and mitigate high risk supplier situations 
in addition to the above risks on the supply side  the company is also exposed to risks associated with demands by its customers for decreases in the price of the company s products 
the company attempts to offset this risk with firm agreements with its customers whenever possible  but these agreements often carry price down provisions 
commodity price risk the company is dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials and supplies in the production process and has  from time to time  entered into firm purchase commitments for copper  aluminum  nickel  and natural gas 
the company utilizes aluminum and copper hedging strategies from time to time by entering into fixed price contracts to help offset changing commodity prices 
the company maintains agreements with certain customers to pass through certain material price fluctuations in order to mitigate the commodity price risk 
the majority of these agreements contain provisions in which the pass through of the price fluctuations can lag behind the actual fluctuations by a quarter or longer 
hedging and foreign currency forward contracts the company uses derivative financial instruments as a tool to manage certain financial risks 
leveraged derivatives are prohibited by company policy 
commodity derivatives the company enters into futures contracts from time to time related to certain of the company s forecasted purchases of aluminum and copper 
the company s strategy in entering into these contracts is to reduce its exposure to changing market prices for future purchases of these commodities 
through the third quarter of fiscal  all these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges by the company 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and recognized as a component of earnings at the same time that the underlying purchases of aluminum and copper impact earnings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the future contracts used for aluminum hedging in the original equipment north america segment became ineffective 
accordingly  the company de designated these hedges and recorded the unrealized gains and losses directly in the consolidated statement of operations 
during the year ended march   million of expense was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the settlement of certain futures contracts and million of income was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the unrealized gains 
during the year ended march   the amount of income recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the settlement of certain futures contracts was negligible 
at march   million of unrealized gain remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next months 

table of contents foreign currency forward contracts modine s foreign exchange risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk 
modine periodically enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the company has not designated these forward contracts as hedges
