item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s results of operations are primarily dependent on the results of the bank  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the bank currently operates eight financial center offices in chester and delaware counties  which are located in southeastern pennsylvania approximately miles west of downtown philadelphia 
the bank s primary business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds together with funds we borrow to originate loans to our customers 
at september   we had total assets of million  including million in net portfolio loans and million of investment securities  total deposits of million and total shareholders equity of million 
our results of operations depend  to a large extent  on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses  fee income and other  non interest income and non interest expenses 
our other  or non interest  expenses principally consist of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  data processing  advertising and business promotion  professional fees  other real estate owned expense and other expense 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial conditions and results of operations 
our business strategy currently is focused on reducing the level of our non performing assets  monitoring and overseeing our performing classified assets and troubled debt restructurings in an effort to limit the number of additional non performing assets in future periods  complying with the provisions of the supervisory agreements and conducting our traditional community oriented banking business within these constraints 
below are certain of the highlights of our business strategy in recent years improving asset quality 
we are continuing in our efforts to improve asset quality 
at september   our total non performing assets amounted to million  or of total assets  reflecting a reduction of million  or  compared to million of total non performing assets at september  when total non performing assets amounted to of total assets 
the relatively high levels of non performing assets and other problem assets significantly impacted our results of operations in recent years as the high levels of provisions for loan losses and charge offs and other expenses related to other real estate owned were the primary reasons that we reported net losses for the fiscal years ended september  and we remain focused on continuing to reduce our non performing and problem assets 
managing our loan portfolio 
as part of our efforts to improve asset quality  we have been actively managing our loan portfolio in recent periods 
in light of the increase in our non performing assets and in order to reduce the risk profile of our loan portfolio  we generally ceased originating any new construction and development loans in october  with certain exceptions  and  in august  we generally ceased originating any new commercial real estate loans 
in addition  the supervisory agreements that we entered into in october prohibit us from  among other things  originating new commercial real estate loans without the prior written non objection of the office of the comptroller of the currency  and limit our ability to grow our assets beyond the amount of net interest credited on our deposits in any quarter 
these factors contributed to a million or  reduction in our total loans outstanding at september  compared to september   with the bulk of such reduction centered in construction and development loans  second mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans 

table of contents increasing capital 
in december  based in part upon communications with staff of the office of the comptroller of the currency and upon consideration of the risk elements inherent in our loan portfolio  the boards of directors of malvern federal bancorp and malvern federal savings bank determined that it was prudent to increase the capital of malvern federal savings bank  although it exceeded the regulatory thresholds necessary to be deemed well capitalized 
initially  malvern federal bancorp made a million capital infusion into malvern federal savings bank in december at september   the bank s tier core capital ratio was  its tier risk based capital ratio was and its total risk based capital ratio was 
we completed our second step conversion and stock offering on october   which resulted in million in net proceeds  million of which was contributed to the bank 
growing our loan portfolio and resuming commercial real estate and construction and development lending 
during fiscal  we plan to seek relief from the supervisory agreements so that  at a minimum  we can resume commercial real estate lending and grow our assets in accordance with our business strategy 
subject to the receipt of relief from the supervisory agreements and any other necessary approvals or non objections from federal banking regulators  we plan to resume  on a relatively modest basis  the origination of commercial real estate loans and construction and development loans in our market area 
such loans will be underwritten in accordance with our strengthened loan underwriting standards and our enhanced credit review and administration procedures 
we continue to believe that we can be a successful niche lender to small and mid sized commercial borrowers and homebuilders in our market area 
assuming we receive regulatory relief from the restrictions of the supervisory agreements  we also plan to resume modest growth of our loan portfolio 
we believe that a resumption of commercial real estate and construction and development lending in a planned  deliberative fashion with the loan underwriting and administration enhancements that we have implemented in recent periods  together with modest loan growth  should increase our interest income and our returns in future periods 
however  no assurance can be given whether  or when  we will receive the necessary relief from the supervisory agreements and any other approvals or non objections to engage in such expanded lending activities in the future 
increasing market share penetration 
we operate in a competitive market area for banking products and services 
in recent fiscal years  we have been working to increase our deposit share in chester and delaware counties  and we increased our marketing and promotional efforts 
however  as a result of the shrinkage of our balance sheet and the reduction in total deposits in fiscal  our deposit market share decreased from in to in we are focused on continuing our efforts to increase market share 
increasing our core deposits 
we are attempting to increase our core deposits  which we define as all deposit products other than certificates of deposit  by offering customers additional deposit products as well as incentives to invest in core deposits 
at september   our core deposits amounted to million  or of total deposits  compared to million  or of total deposits  at september  we have continued our promotional efforts to increase core deposits and expect to add additional deposit products in fiscal as part of our efforts to increase core deposits 
we review our deposit products on an on going basis and we are considering additional deposit products as well as more flexible delivery options  such as mobile banking  as part of our efforts to increase core deposits 
we expect to increase our commercial checking accounts when we resume commercial lending and we plan to enhance our cross marketing as part of our efforts to gain additional deposit relationships with our loan customers 
continuing to provide exceptional customer service 
as a community oriented savings bank  we take pride in providing exceptional customer service as a means to attract and retain customers 
we deliver personalized service to our customers that distinguish us from the large regional banks operating in our market area 
our management team has strong ties to  and deep roots in  the community 
we believe that we know our customers banking needs and can respond quickly to address them 

table of contents this management s discussion and analysis section is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of malvern federal bancorp 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies in reviewing and understanding financial information for malvern federal bancorp  inc  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in item of this annual report on form k 
the accounting and financial reporting policies of malvern federal bancorp conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and to general practices within the banking industry 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the statement of financial condition date and is recorded as a reduction to loans 
reserves for unfunded lending commitments represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses  and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses  and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
all  or part  of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
non residential consumer loans are generally charged off no later than when they become days past due on a contractual basis or earlier in the event of the borrower s bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  the composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired 
for loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired  as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as residential real estate  home equity and other consumer loans 
these pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans  as adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
once all factor adjustments are applied  general reserve allocations for each segment are calculated  summarized and reported on the alll summary 
alll final schedules  calculations and the resulting evaluation process are reviewed quarterly by the asset classification committee and the board of directors 

table of contents a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the allowance is adjusted for other significant factors that affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date including changes in lending policy and procedures  loan volume and concentrations  seasoning of the portfolio  loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  and bank regulatory examination results 
other factors include changes in economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas and credit quality trends 
loss factors are reevaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
we review key ratios such as the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable and as a percentage of non performing loans  however  we do not try to maintain any specific target range for these ratios 
while management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance 
historically  our estimates of the allowance for loan losses have not required significant adjustments from management s initial estimates 
in addition  the occ and  previously  the ots  as an integral part of its examination processes  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
as previously indicated  the supervisory agreement that we entered into in october requires that we  among other things  revise our policies  procedures and methodologies relating to the allowance for loan losses  submit an internal asset classification and review program  and submit a written plan to reduce the level of the bank s problem assets as defined 
see item  business general 
fair value measurements 
the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets to determine fair value disclosures 
investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis  such as impaired loans  real estate owned and certain other assets 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
under fasb asc topic  fair value measurements  the company groups its assets at fair value in three levels  based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value 
these levels are level valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset 

table of contents under fasb asc topic  the company bases its fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
it is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in fasb asc topic fair value measurements for assets where there exists limited or no observable market data and  therefore  are based primarily upon the company s or other third party s estimates  are often calculated based on the characteristics of the asset  the economic and competitive environment and other such factors 
therefore  the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset 
additionally  there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  that could significantly affect the results of current or future valuations 
at september   the company had million of assets that were measured at fair value on a non recurring basis using level measurements 
income taxes 
we make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
we also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision to our initial estimates 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
realization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences 
our net deferred tax asset amounted to million at september  other than an  allowance with respect to state net operating losses and  allowance with respect to charitable contributions  we have not established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining amount of the asset will be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we must estimate our taxable income in future years and viable tax planning strategies we could employ so that the asset would not go unused 
our deferred tax asset may be reduced in the future if estimates of future income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset 
if it is determined that a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax asset is necessary  we may incur a charge to earnings and a reduction to regulatory capital for the amount included therein 
other than temporary impairment of securities securities are evaluated on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation  to determine whether declines in their value are other than temporary 
to determine whether a loss in value is other than temporary  management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline  the magnitude and duration of the decline and whether or not management intends to sell or expects that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery of the fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other than temporary  the other than temporary impairment is separated into a the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security the credit loss and b the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to all other factors 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 

table of contents how we manage market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk which is inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure 
in addition to market risk  our primary risk is credit risk on our loan portfolio 
we attempt to manage credit risk through our loan underwriting and oversight policies 
the principal objective of our interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk embedded in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines 
we seek to manage our exposure to risks from changes in interest rates while at the same time trying to improve our net interest spread 
we monitor interest rate risk as such risk relates to our operating strategies 
we have established an alco committee  which is comprised of our president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer and five outside directors  and which is responsible for reviewing our asset liability and investment policies and interest rate risk position 
the alco committee meets on a regular basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on future earnings 
in recent years  we primarily have utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk we have increased our outstanding shorter term loans particularly commercial real estate and construction loans although we generally ceased originating any new commercial real estate and construction loans in fiscal  we have attempted to match fund a portion of our loan portfolio with borrowings having similar expected lives  on occasion  we have sold long term year fixed rate mortgage loans with servicing retained  we have attempted  where possible  to extend the maturities of our deposits and borrowings  and we have invested in securities with relatively short anticipated lives  generally one to three years  and we hold significant amounts of liquid assets 
as part of our asset liability management efforts  during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended september   we securitized and sold million of long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans with the servicing retained 
this securitization sale transaction resulted in a gain of  gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset and liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income 
our one year cumulative gap was a negative at september 
table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at september   which we expect  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at september   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
annual prepayment rates for single family and other mortgage loans are assumed to range from to 
the weighted average life for investment securities is assumed to range from year to years 
savings accounts and interest bearing checking accounts are assumed to have annual rates of withdrawal  or decay rates  of and  respectively

for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes non performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses  undisbursed loan funds  unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest rate sensitivity gap represents the net cumulative difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
net portfolio value and net interest income analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the table below sets forth as of september  and  the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rates changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
as of september  as of september  changes in interest rates basis points amount dollar change from base percentage change from base amount dollar change from base percentage change from base dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates 
a basis point equals 
in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows our nii model as of september  changes in interest rates in basis points rate shock net interest income change change dollars in thousands static as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 

table of contents average balances  net interest income  and yields earned and rates paid 
the following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
tax exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis 
all average balances are based on monthly balances 
management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be

this increase was partially offset by an aggregate million reduction in net loans receivable and a million reduction in other real estate owned reo 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents at september  compared to september  was due to million in stock subscriptions received in our second step conversion and stock offering 
subsequent to september   we returned approximately million in excess subscriptions received in the stock offering 
the decrease in loans receivable during fiscal was due to a million loan sale securitization during fiscal  as well as decreased demand from consumers  the internal lending restrictions we adopted early in fiscal  and the restrictions imposed by the supervisory agreements that we entered into with the ots in october the million reduction in reo at september  compared to september   was due to million of net sales in reo properties  at a net gain of  and million in reductions to reo fair values  which are reflected as reo expense during fiscal our total reo amounted to million at september  compared to million at september  for additional information on our reo  see business asset quality non performing loans and real estate owned 
our total liabilities at september   were million compared to million at september  the million  or increase in total liabilities was due primarily to the receipt of million of subscription orders received in our second step conversion and stock offering held in escrow at september   which more than offset a million decrease in total deposits for fiscal our total deposits were million at september  compared to million at september  there was a million decrease in our fhlb advances for fiscal 
table of contents our shareholders equity increased by million to million at september  compared to million at september  primarily due to an increase in retained earnings and the effect of an increase in our accumulated other comprehensive income at september  retained earnings increased by million to million at september  primarily as a result of the million net income for fiscal our ratio of equity to assets was at september  subsequent to september   our shareholders equity was significantly increased upon the receipt of million in net proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and september  general 
our net income was million for the year ended september  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended september  on a per share basis  the net income was per share for the year ended september   compared to net loss of per share for the year ended september  the primary reason for the million improvement in our results of operations in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was a reduction in the provision of loan losses of million  which was partially offset by a million increase in income tax expense and a million decrease in net interest income 
our interest rate spread was and our net interest margin was for the year ended september   compared to a net interest spread of and a net interest margin of for the year ended september  interest and dividend income 
our interest and dividend income decreased for the year ended september  by million or over the comparable fiscal period to million 
interest income on loans decreased for the year ended september  over the prior comparable period in fiscal by million  or 
the decrease in interest earned on loans in fiscal was due primarily to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of our outstanding loans as well as a basis point decrease in the average yield earned on our loan portfolio in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income on investment securities increased by  or  in fiscal over the comparable prior fiscal year period 
the increase in interest income on investment securities in fiscal was due to an million  or  increase in the average balance of our investment securities portfolio 
interest expense 
our interest expense for the year ended september  was million  a decrease of million from the year ended september  the reason for the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was a basis point decrease in average rate paid on total deposits together with a decrease in the average balance of our total deposits of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to a million decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit 
the average rate paid on total deposits decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal our expense on borrowings amounted to million in fiscal  which was substantially unchanged from fiscal the average balance of our borrowings decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  however the average rate paid on borrowed funds increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal provision for loan losses 
management has identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy 
this policy is significantly affected by our judgment and uncertainties and there is likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different  but reasonably plausible  conditions or assumptions 
our activity in the provision for loan losses  which are charges or recoveries to operating results  is undertaken in order to maintain a level of total allowance for losses that management believes covers all known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at each reporting date 
our evaluation process typically includes  among other things  an analysis of delinquency trends  non performing loan trends  the level of charge offs and recoveries  prior loss experience  total loans outstanding  the volume of loan originations  the type  size and geographic concentration of our loans  the value of collateral securing the loan  the borrower s ability to repay and repayment performance  the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight  local economic conditions and industry experience 
the establishment of the allowance for loan losses is significantly affected by management judgment and uncertainties and there is likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management 

table of contents the provision for loan losses was  for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september  the million difference in the provision for loan losses for the year ended september   among other things  reflects the overall improvement in the trend of our levels of delinquent  impaired and non performing loans 
at september   our total loans more than days past due amounted to million  a million  or  improvement compared to september  our total impaired loans amounted to million at september   a million  or  reduction compared to our impaired loans at september  our total non accrual loans were million at september  compared to million at september   a million  or  reduction 
in addition to the improvements in the levels of our delinquent  impaired and non performing loans during the year ended september   the reduction in the provision for loan losses during the fiscal period also reflects the aggressive actions that we took in fiscal to increase the oversight and resolution of our non performing and problem loans as well as the significant increases to the allowance for loan losses made in fiscal with respect to loans that remained in our portfolio or were resolved during the year ended september  our total gross charge offs for the year ended september  were million  a million  or  improvement compared to million of charge offs during the year ended september  we recorded million in total recoveries to the allowance for loan losses during the year ended september   due primarily to the receipt of a million payment in full satisfaction of a million participation interest in a construction and development loan on a retirement community located in montgomery county  pennsylvania 
our ratio of net charge offs to the total allowance for loan losses was for the fiscal year ended september  compared to for the fiscal year ended september  as of september   the balance of the allowance for loan losses was million  or of gross loans and of non accruing loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million or of gross loans and of non accruing loans at september  see business asset quality non performing loans and real estate owned in item of this annual report on form k 
we will continue to monitor and modify our allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate 
no assurances can be given that our level of allowance for loan losses will cover all of the inherent losses on our loans or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses 
as previously indicated on page under business asset quality delinquent loans  we have a group of four loans to one borrower with an aggregate outstanding balance of million at september   and classified as substandard at such date 
we are attempting to negotiate a loan modification agreement with the borrower  however  if a satisfactory loan modification agreement cannot be structured  these loans are likely to be placed on non accrual status during the first quarter of fiscal in such event  we estimate that an additional charge to the allowance for loan losses of approximately million would be required with respect to these loans if they are placed on non accrual status 
other income 
our other  or non interest  income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in other income during fiscal was due primarily to a  net gain recorded on the sale of securities  which consisted of a  gain recorded on the securitization and sale of million of long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans and a  gain on the sale of million of investment securities

while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
at september   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
in addition  at such date our available for sale investment securities amounted to million 
we use our liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses

at september   we had million in outstanding long term fhlb advances and we had million in potential fhlb advances available to us 
in addition  at september   we had a million line of credit with the fhlb  of which none was outstanding 
in addition to cash flow from loan and securities payments and prepayments as well as from sales of available for sale securities  we have significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs 
in recent years we have utilized borrowings as a cost efficient addition to deposits as a source of funds 
our borrowings consist primarily of advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  of which we are a member 
under terms of the collateral agreement with the federal home loan bank  we pledge residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as well as our stock in the federal home loan bank as collateral for such advances

these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  lines of credit and letters of credit 
the contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon  the customer defaults and the value of any existing collateral becomes worthless

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  therefore  the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on its performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this project began as an attempt to converge the offsetting requirements under us gaap and international reporting standards ifrs

the new disclosure requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
asu no 
also requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting arrangements or similar arrangements 
asu no

only impact the disclosure requirements related to the offsetting of assets and liabilities  the adoption will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
the provisions of asu no 
allow an entity the option to present the total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both options  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
under either method  entities are required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented

asu no 
 which shares the same effective date as asu no 
 does not defer the requirement for entities to present components of comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements

the boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this asu are required to be applied prospectively  and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of asu no
