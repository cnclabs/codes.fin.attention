item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of porter bancorp  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  pbi bank 
porter bancorp  inc is a louisville  kentucky based bank holding company which operates full service banking offices in twelve counties through its wholly owned subsidiary  pbi bank 
our markets include metropolitan louisville in jefferson county and the surrounding counties of henry and bullitt  and extend south along the interstate corridor to tennessee 
we serve south central kentucky and southern kentucky from banking offices in butler  green  hart  edmonson  barren  warren  ohio  and daviess counties 
we also have an office in lexington  the second largest city in kentucky 
our markets have experienced annual positive deposit growth rates in recent years with the trend expected to continue 
the bank is both a traditional community bank with a wide range of commercial and personal banking products and an innovative online bank which delivers competitive deposit products and services through an on line banking division operating under the name of ascencia 
historically  we have focused on commercial and commercial real estate lending  both in markets where we have banking offices and other growing markets in our region 
commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loans accounted for of our total loan portfolio as of december   and as of december  commercial lending generally produces higher yields than residential lending  but involves greater risk and requires more rigorous underwriting standards and credit quality monitoring 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other schedules presented elsewhere in the report 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million compared to net loss of million for the year ended december  after deductions for dividends on preferred stock  accretion on preferred stock  and earnings allocated to participating securities  the net loss to common shareholders was million for the year ended december   compared to net loss to common shareholders of million for the year ended december  basic and diluted loss per common share were for the year ended december   compared to loss per common share of for the decline in our financial performance in was primarily due to losses in our commercial real estate and construction and land development loan portfolios 
weakness in demand for housing units in our markets continues to negatively impact values of collateral securing our loans and other real estate owned oreo  as well as some customers ability to repay their loans 
as a result of these trends we charged off a high level of commercial real estate and construction and land development loans 
we also wrote down other real estate owned to reflect declining real estate values reflected in new appraisals and our strategy to bulk sell certain properties 
non performing loans were of total loans and nonperforming assets stood at of total assets at december  we remain diligent in the management of our portfolio and are striving to improve credit quality by working throughout our markets with our clients to balance selective new customer acquisition  customer service for our existing clients and prudent risk management 
in addition  we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million during the second quarter of the write off of goodwill was a non cash accounting entry that had no effect on liquidity  regulatory capital or regulatory capital ratios 
approximately million of the impairment charge was deductible for federal tax purposes 
the after tax impact of the goodwill impairment charge was million  or per common share 
we also established a deferred tax valuation allowance of million in december based upon a detailed analysis of our past performance and our expected future performance 
we considered all evidence currently available  both positive and negative  in determining  based on the weight of that evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax asset would be realized 
during that review  we determined that the level of our recent historical losses  the level of our non performing assets  our inability to meet our forecasted levels of earnings in  our intent to defer payment of dividends on our subordinated debentures and series a preferred stock  and our non compliance with the capital requirements of our consent order outweighed our forecasted taxable earnings levels for the near and long term 
as such  we established a deferred tax valuation allowance 
a return to profitability would enable us to reduce the valuation allowance and thereby offset income tax expense that would otherwise be recognized 
significant developments for the year ended december  were loans decreased to billion compared to billion at december  total assets decreased to billion since the year end 
deposits declined to billion compared with billion at december  net interest margin decreased to for compared with for we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million during the second quarter of the write off of goodwill was a non cash accounting entry that had no effect on liquidity  regulatory capital or regulatory capital ratios 
approximately million of the impairment charge was deductible for federal tax purposes 
the after tax impact of the goodwill impairment charge was million or per common share 
we established a valuation allowance for our million deferred tax asset in december non performing assets increased from million at december   to million at december  provision for loan losses increased million in compared with as the result of an increase in non performing loans  and an increase in net loan charge offs of million  or of average loans for  compared with million  or of average loans for other real estate owned oreo expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to million in fair value write downs tied to declining real estate values reflected in new appraisals and our strategy to bulk sell certain properties  as well as the ongoing carrying and maintenance costs for the oreo portfolio 
on june   pbi bank entered into a consent order with the fdic and the kentucky department of financial institutions 
the consent order establishes benchmarks for the bank to improve its asset quality  reduce its loan concentrations  and maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio of and a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 
at december   the bank s tier leverage ratio declined to and its total risk based capital ratio declined to  which are below the minimums of and required by the bank s consent order 
at december   porter bancorp s leverage ratio was and its total risk based capital ratio was 
we are continuing our efforts to strengthen our capital levels and comply with the consent order 
on september   we entered into a formal written agreement with the federal bank of st 
louis 
porter bancorp made formal commitments in the agreement to use its financial and management resources to serve as a source of strength for the bank and to assist the bank in addressing weaknesses identified by the fdic and the kdfi  to pay no dividends without prior written approval  to pay no interest or principal on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities without written approval  and to submit an acceptable plan to maintain sufficient capital 
these items are discussed in further detail throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
recent developments and future plans during  we recorded a net loss to common shareholders of million 
this loss is primarily attributable to a million goodwill impairment charge  the establishment of a million valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  oreo expense of million related to valuation adjustments for our change in strategy related to certain properties and increase in carrying costs associated with carrying these higher levels of assets  as well as provision for loan losses expense of million due to the continued decline in credit trends within our portfolio 
in june  the bank agreed to a consent order with the fdic and kdfi in which the bank agreed  among other things  to improve asset quality  reduce loan concentrations  and maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio of and a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 
the consent order was included in our current report on k filed on june  as of december   these capital ratios were not met 
in order to meet these capital requirements  the board of directors and management are continuing to evaluate strategies including the following continue to operate the company and bank in a safe and sound manner 
this strategy will require us to continue to reduce the size of our balance sheet  reduce our lending concentrations  consider selling loans  and reduce other noninterest expense through the disposition of oreo 
our historical losses have been significant in construction and development lending 
o we recorded net construction and development loan charge offs totaling and million in and  respectively 
this represented approximately and of our total net loan charge offs in and  respectively 
o in  management determined  with the concurrence of the board of directors  that certain properties held in oreo were not likely to be successfully disposed of in an acceptable time frame using routine marketing efforts 
it became apparent due to weakness in the economy and softness in demand for housing that certain land development and residential condominium projects would require extended holding periods to sell the properties at recent appraised values 
accordingly  in june of  the company sold  in a single transaction  finished condominium property units from condominium developments held in our oreo portfolio with a carrying value of approximately million  for million  resulting in a pre tax loss of million 
o although we were carrying our oreo at fair market value less estimated cost to sell  we subsequently adjusted our valuations for land development and residential development properties held in oreo similar to the properties we sold earlier in our fair value adjustments totaled approximately million to reflect our intent to market these properties more aggressively to retail and bulk buyers 
additionally  we recorded approximately million of fair value adjustments related to new appraisals received for properties in the portfolio during o in summary  we recorded net construction and development oreo fair value adjustments and loss on sale of oreo totaling and million in and  respectively 
this represents approximately and of our total oreo fair value adjustments and loss on sale in and  respectively 
we are committed to reducing loan concentrations and balance sheet risk 
o our consent order calls for us to reduce our construction and development loans to not more than of total risk based capital 
these loans totaled million  or of total risk based capital  at december  o our consent order also requires us to reduce non owner occupied commercial real estate loans  construction and development loans  and multifamily residential real estate loans as a group  to not more than of total risk based capital 
these loans totaled million  or of total risk based capital  at december  o we are working to reduce these loans by curtailing new construction and development lending and new non owner occupied commercial real estate lending 
we are also receiving principal reductions from amortizing credits and pay downs from our customers who sell properties built for resale 
while we have not yet reduced our balances in these categories to the required percentages  we have reduced the construction loan portfolio from million at december  to million at december  our non owner occupied commercial real estate loans declined from million at december  to million at december  raise capital by selling common stock through a public offering or private placement to existing and new investors 
evaluate other strategic alternatives  such as the sale of assets or branches 
bank regulatory agencies can exercise discretion when an institution does not meet the terms of a consent order 
based on individual circumstances  the agencies may issue mandatory directives  impose monetary penalties  initiate changes in management  or refrain from formal sanctions 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of management assumptions and judgments that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
allowance for loan losses pbi bank maintains an allowance for loan losses believed to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio  and the board of directors evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance using  among other things  historical loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral and current economic conditions and trends 
the allowance may be allocated for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired 
the general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for environmental factors 
we develop allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends 
allowance estimates are a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio which we apply to individual loans based on loan type 
if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  we may be required to materially increase our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses  which could adversely affect our results 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
it is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
when property is acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  it is recorded at its fair market value less estimated cost to sell 
any write down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent reductions in fair value are recorded as non interest expense 
to determine the fair value of oreo for smaller dollar single family homes  we consult with internal real estate sales staff and external realtors  investors  and appraisers 
if the internally evaluated market price is below our underlying investment in the property  appropriate write downs are recorded 
for larger dollar commercial real estate properties  we obtain a new appraisal of the subject property in connection with the transfer to other real estate owned 
we do not obtain updated appraisals on a quarterly basis after the receipt of the initial appraisal 
rather  we internally review the fair value of the other real estate owned in our portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine if a new appraisal is warranted based on the specific circumstances of each property 
we obtain updated appraisals each year on the anniversary of ownership unless a sale is imminent 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the book value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value  net of goodwill  exceeds book value  then goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment during the second quarter of because our common stock  which trades publicly on the nasdaq  experienced a significant drop in value throughout the months of may and june we evaluated goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of with the assistance of an independent valuation professional by applying a series of fair value based tests 
while step of the evaluation indicated potential impairment  the detailed step test concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
our stock trended downward during the first quarter of and continued downward throughout the months of may and june the stock closed on june  at per share and has traded at a market price less than book value per common share since the second quarter of we evaluated the potential negative impact on the value of our common stock from being removed from the russell index during june  the trend of lower earnings in compared to historical performance due to the continuing impact on earnings from loan loss provisions  non performing loans  and foreclosed properties  and recent regulatory agreements entered into by the company 
our goodwill impairment testing completed during the fourth quarter of included  among other things  future projections of earnings at levels exceeding actual results for the level of loan loss provisions and the cost of foreclosed properties continue to exceed our prior expectations as we work through issues with our non performing loan levels and other real estate owned portfolio 
the fair value was determined utilizing our market capitalization based upon recent common stock price levels 
we also considered market comparison transactions and control premiums for institutions of a similar size and performance 
based on this analysis  we determined that our goodwill was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended june  the impairment charge had no impact on the company s liquidity  cash flows  or regulatory capital ratios 
intangible assets that are not amortized are evaluated for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on an accelerated basis over the years expected to be benefited  which we believe is years 
we review these amortizable intangible assets for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
based on our annual review  management does not believe our intangible assets are impaired at december  stock based compensation compensation cost is recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards issued to employees  based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant 
we utilize a black scholes model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  such as volatility  risk free interest rates and dividend pay out rates  to estimate the fair value of stock options  while the market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards 
compensation cost is recognized over the required service period  generally defined as the vesting period 
for awards with graded vesting  compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
valuation of deferred tax asset we evaluate deferred tax assets for impairment on a quarterly basis 
we established a deferred tax valuation allowance of million in december based upon the analysis of our past performance and our expected future performance 
we considered all evidence currently available  both positive and negative  in determining  based on the weight of that evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax asset would be realized 
during that review  we determined that the level of our recent historical losses  the level of our non performing assets  our inability to meet our forecasted levels of earnings in  our intent to defer payment of dividends on our subordinated debentures and series a preferred stock  and our non compliance with the capital requirements of our consent order outweighed our forecasted taxable earnings levels for the near and long term 
as such  we established a deferred tax valuation allowance 
a return to profitability would enable us to reduce the valuation allowance and thereby offset income tax expense that would otherwise be recognized 
examinations of our income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact our deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as our provision for income taxes

our non interest income was also lower due to decreased service charges on deposit accounts of  or  and decreased secondary market brokerage fees of  or 
fewer service charges on deposit account fees were the result of lower transaction volume 
these decreases were partially offset by increased gains on sales of loans originated for sale of  or  and lower other than temporary impairment charges of  or 
non interest income increased by million to million for compared with million for this was primarily driven by gains on sales of investment securities which increased from  in to million in as we restructured our investment portfolio by selling our private label mortgage backed securities portfolio and to a lesser degree certain other mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds

the increase in non interest expense was primarily attributable to an increase in other real estate owned expense from increased losses on sales of oreo  oreo write downs to reflect declining market values and the impact of our sales strategy change in regard to certain oreo properties  and oreo maintenance expenses 
expenses related to other real estate owned include in thousands net loss on sales provision to allowance for sales strategy change provision to allowance for declining market values operating expense total in  management determined  with the concurrence of the board of directors  that certain properties held in oreo were not likely to be successfully disposed of in an acceptable time frame using routine marketing efforts 
it became apparent due to weakness in the economy and softness in demand for housing that certain land development and residential condominium projects would require extended holding periods to sell the properties at recent appraised values 
accordingly  in june of  the company sold  in a single transaction  finished condominium property units from condominium developments held in our oreo portfolio with a carrying value of approximately million  for million  resulting in a pre tax loss of million 
although we were carrying our oreo at fair market value less estimated cost to sell  we subsequently adjusted our valuations for land development and residential development properties held in oreo similar to the properties we sold in we recorded an allowance totaling approximately million to reflect our intent to market these properties more aggressively to retail and bulk buyers 
additionally  we recorded approximately million of fair value write downs related to new appraisals received for properties in the portfolio during loan collection expense increased million  or  to million in from  in due to settlements of certain legal matters and increased volume of foreclosures 
in june  we settled this litigation for less than the  minimum amount of compensatory and punitive damages awarded in a jury verdict against pbi bank  which we recorded in the second quarter as loan collection expense 
we also recorded approximately  of loan collection expense in related to a jefferson county  kentucky court ruling to uphold a contested mechanics lien on a property for which we took a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
fdic insurance assessments increased  or  to million in from million in as a result of our non performing asset levels 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased  or  to million in from million in due to merit raises and increases in staff primarily in the credit and problem asset workout areas 
professional fees increased  or  to million in from million in due to increased accounting and evaluation services related to goodwill impairment and deferred tax assets  and increased staff recruitment services and management evaluation services 
we incurred borrowing prepayment fees of  on the retirement of a million repurchase agreement prior to maturity and  on the prepayment of million of fhlb advances prior to maturity 
we elected to redeem these higher cost borrowings in connection with our asset liability planning and to lower our cost of funds in future periods 
no similar transactions occurred in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy and equipment expense of  or  due to reduced depreciation on equipment expense  and decreased postage and delivery expense of  or  due to our decision to replace certain third party courier services with in house personnel 
goodwill impairment the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter unless events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred between annual assessments 
goodwill was reviewed for impairment during the second quarter of because the market price of our common stock on nasdaq experienced a significant drop throughout the months of may and june we assessed goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of with the assistance of an independent valuation professional by applying a series of fair value based tests 
at that time  our common stock was trading between and per share 
while step of last year s evaluation indicated potential impairment  the detailed step test concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
our stock trended downward during the first quarter of to a low of per share and continued downward throughout the months of may and june the stock closed on june  at per share and has traded at a market price less than book value per common share since the second quarter of our market value to book value ratios are noted below 
the ratio at june  is reflected on a pre goodwill impairment charge basis 
market value to book value ratio book value per share market price per share market to book ratio we evaluated the potential negative impact on the value of our common stock from being removed from the russell index during june  the trend of lower earnings in compared to historical performance due to the continuing impact on earnings from loan loss provisions  non performing loans  and foreclosed properties  and recent regulatory agreements entered into by the company 
our goodwill impairment testing completed during the fourth quarter of included  among other things  future projections of earnings at levels exceeding actual results for the level of loan loss provisions and the cost of foreclosed properties continue to exceed our prior expectations as we work through issues with our non performing loan levels and other real estate owned portfolio 
we determined the fair value utilizing our market capitalization based upon recent common stock price levels 
we also considered market comparison transactions and control premiums for institutions of a similar size and performance 
based on this analysis  we determined that our goodwill was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended june  the impairment charge had no impact on the company s liquidity  cash flows  or regulatory ratios 
non interest expense comparison to non interest expense for the year ended december  of million represented a increase from million from other real estate owned oreo expense increased million   to million in from million in due to write downs of oreo to reflect declining real estate values during the year  increased losses on sales of oreo  and increased oreo maintenance costs 
during  we recorded fair value write downs on our oreo portfolio totaling approximately million to reflect lower appraised values driven by declining real estate values in our markets during the year 
occupancy expense increased  or  to million in from million in due to increased maintenance costs related to computer equipment  and increased equipment lease expense 
state franchise tax  which is based on the most recent five year average capital balances  increased  or  due to increased bank capital resulting from million of capital contributions from its parent  pbi  during  and growth from capital injections and net earnings over the five year averaging period 
professional fees increased  or  to million in from  in due to increased accounting  legal  and consulting services 
non interest expense increases were partially offset by a decrease in salary and benefits expense of  or  due to decreased incentive compensation expense and discretionary k match expense 
these decreases were partially offset by increased medical insurance costs from increased coverage rates 
income tax expense income tax benefit was  for compared with million for the income tax benefit was significantly affected by the establishment of a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset of million 
our statutory federal tax rate was in both and our effective federal tax rate was in the effective tax rate for is not meaningful due to the reduction of income tax benefit as the result of the establishment of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets does not have any impact on our liquidity  nor does it preclude us from using the tax losses  tax credits or other timing differences in the future 
to the extent we generate taxable income in a given quarter  the valuation allowance may be reduced to fully or partially offset the corresponding income tax expense

loan maturity schedule the following table sets forth information at december   regarding the dollar amount of loans  net of deferred loan fees  maturing in the loan portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity as of december  maturing within one year maturing through years maturing over years total loans dollars in thousands loans with fixed rates commercial commercial real estate construction farmland other residential real estate multi family family consumer agriculture other total fixed rate loans loans with floating rates commercial commercial real estate construction farmland other residential real estate multi family family consumer agriculture other total floating rate loans non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans past due days or more still on accrual  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
loans  including impaired loans  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans are reviewed on a regular basis and normal collection procedures are implemented when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
consumer loans generally are charged off when a loan is deemed uncollectible by management and any available collateral has been disposed 
commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies are handled on an individual basis by management with the advice of legal counsel 
interest income on loans is recognized on the accrual basis except for those loans placed on non accrual status 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  which typically occurs after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when interest accrual is discontinued  existing accrued interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
new and used automobiles and other motor vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired it is recorded at its fair market value less cost to sell 
any write down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest expense

loans more than days past due increased  and non accrual loans increased million  respectively  from december  to december  the million in nonperforming loans at december   and million at december   were primarily construction  land development  other land  commercial real estate  and residential real estate loans 
the protracted slowdown in housing unit sales and loss of tenants or inability to lease vacant office and retail space has placed inordinate stress on these customers and their ability to repay according to the contractual terms of the loans 
as such  we have placed these credits on non accrual and have begun the appropriate collection actions to resolve them 
management believes it has established adequate loan loss reserves for these credits 
loans past due days decreased from million at december  to million at december  loans past due days decreased from million at december  to million at december  this represents a million decrease from december  to december   in loans past due days 
these decreases were primarily in the commercial real estate  residential real estate  and consumer segments of the portfolio 
we considered this trend in delinquency levels during the evaluation of qualitative trends in the portfolio when establishing the general component of our allowance for loan losses 
troubled debt restructuring a troubled debt restructuring tdr is where the company has agreed to a loan modification in the form of a concession for a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty 
the majority of the company s tdrs involve a reduction in interest rate  a deferral of principal for a stated period of time  or an interest only period 
all tdrs are considered impaired  and the company has allocated reserves for these loans to reflect the present value of the concessionary terms granted to the customer 
we do not have a formal loan modification program 
rather  we work with individual customers on a case by case basis to facilitate the orderly collection of our principal and interest before a loan becomes a non performing loan 
if a customer is unable to make contractual payments  we review the particular circumstances of that customer s situation and negotiate a revised payment stream 
in other words  we identify performing customers experiencing financial difficulties  and through negotiations  we lower their interest rate  most typically on a short term basis for three to six months 
our goal when restructuring a credit is to afford the customer a reasonable period of time to remedy the issue causing cash flow constraints within their business so that they can return to performing status over time 
our loan modifications have taken the form of reduction in interest rate and or curtailment of scheduled principal payments for a short term period  usually three to six months  but in some cases until maturity of the loan 
in some circumstances we restructure real estate secured loans in a bifurcated fashion whereby we have a fully amortizing a loan at a market interest rate and an interest only b loan at a reduced interest rate 
our restructured loans are all collateral secured loans 
if a customer fails to perform under the modified terms  we place the loan s on non accrual status and begin the process of working with the customer to liquidate the underlying collateral to satisfy the debt 
at december   we had restructured loans totaling million with borrowers who experienced deterioration in financial condition compared with loans totaling million at december  in general  these loans were granted interest rate reductions to provide cash flow relief to customers experiencing cash flow difficulties 
of these loans  loans totaling approximately million were also granted principal payment deferrals until maturity 
there were no concessions made to forgive principal relative to these loans  although we have recorded partial charge offs for certain restructured loans 
in general  these loans are secured by first liens on residential or commercial real estate properties  or farmland 
restructured loans also included million of commercial loans 
in accordance with current guidance  we continue to report restructured loans as restructured until such time as the loan is paid in full  otherwise settled  sold  or charged off 
if the customer fails to perform  we place the loan on non accrual status and seek to liquidate the underlying collateral for these loans 
our non accrual policy for restructured loans is identical to our non accrual policy for all loans 
our policy calls for a loan to be reported as non accrual if it is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  payment in full of principal and interest is not expected  or principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more unless the assets are both well secured and in the process of collection 
changes in value for impairment  including the amount attributed to the passage of time  are recorded entirely within the provision for loan losses 
we consider any loan that is restructured for a borrower experiencing financial difficulties due to a borrower s potential inability to pay in accordance with contractual terms of the loan to be a troubled debt restructure 
specifically  we consider a concession involving a modification of the loan terms  such as i a reduction of the stated interest rate  ii reduction or deferral of principal  or iii reduction or deferral of accrued interest at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk all to be troubled debt restructurings 
when a modification of terms is made for a competitive reason  we do not consider that to be a troubled debt restructuring 
a primary example of a competitive modification would be an interest rate reduction for a performing customer s loan to a market rate as the result of a market decline in rates 
see footnote  loans  to the financial statements for additional disclosure related to troubled debt restructuring 
foreclosed properties foreclosed properties at december  were million compared with million at december  see footnote  other real estate owned  to the financial statements 
during  we acquired million of oreo properties  completed improvements to single family residential units of approximately million  and sold properties totaling approximately million 
we value foreclosed properties at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired and expect to liquidate these properties to recover our investment in the due course of business 
other real estate owned oreo is recorded at fair market value less estimated cost to sell at time of acquisition 
any write down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent reductions in fair value are recorded as non interest expense 
to determine the fair value of oreo for smaller dollar single family homes  we consult with internal real estate sales staff and external realtors  investors  and appraisers 
if the internally evaluated market price is below our underlying investment in the property  appropriate write downs are recorded 
for larger dollar commercial real estate properties  we obtain a new appraisal of the subject property in connection with the transfer to other real estate owned 
in some of these circumstances  an appraisal is in process at quarter end and we must make our best estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral based on our internal evaluation of the property  review of the most recent appraisal  and discussions with the currently engaged appraiser 
we obtain updated appraisals on the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent 
the following table presents the major categories of oreo at the year ends indicated in thousands commercial real estate construction farmland other residential real estate multi family family net activity relating to other real estate owned during the years indicated is as follows in thousands oreo activity oreo as of january real estate acquired valuation adjustments for sales strategy change valuation adjustments for declining market values improvements loss on sale proceeds from sale of properties oreo as of december in  we explored opportunities to bulk sell oreo in addition to our historical strategy of selling properties on an individual basis to retail buyers 
the costs associated with ownership and maintenance of foreclosed properties can be significant 
with concurrence of the board of directors  we determined that certain residential land and condominium development properties held in other real estate were not likely to be successfully disposed of in an acceptable time frame using routine marketing efforts 
it became apparent due to weakness in the economy and softness in demand that these properties were going to require extended holding periods to sell the properties at recent appraised values 
given our change in strategy to reduce non performing assets in an accelerated manner  management adjusted downward the valuations for certain residential land and condominium development properties in our oreo portfolio to reflect the likely net realizable value achievable by aggressively marketing these properties through bulk sale opportunities 
accordingly  during june  we sold  in a single transaction  finished condominium property units from our oreo portfolio  with a carrying value of approximately million for million  resulting in a pre tax loss of million 
although we were carrying our oreo at fair market value less estimated cost to sell  we subsequently adjusted our valuations for land development and residential development properties held in oreo similar to the properties we sold in we recorded an allowance totaling approximately million to reflect our intent to market these properties more aggressively to retail and bulk buyers 
additionally  we recorded approximately million of fair value write downs related to new appraisals received for properties in the portfolio during we were also successful in selling oreo totaling million during the year ended december  allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of individual loans  loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics of various categories of loans and such other factors that  in management s judgment  require current recognition in estimating loan losses 
the following table sets forth an analysis of loan loss experience as of and for the periods indicated as of december  dollars in thousands balances at beginning of period loans charged off real estate commercial consumer agriculture total charge offs recoveries real estate commercial consumer agriculture total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance acquired in bank acquisition balance at end of period allowance for loan losses to period end loans net charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans our allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific reserves and general reserves 
generally  all loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific allowance is required 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will not receive all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
once a loan has been identified as impaired  management measures impairment in accordance with asc  impairment of a loan 
when management s measured value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the amount of the impairment is recorded as a specific reserve 
these specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis based on management s current evaluation of our loss exposure for each credit given the payment status  financial condition of the borrower and value of any underlying collateral 
loans for which specific reserves have been provided are excluded from the general reserve calculations described below 
changes in specific reserves from period to period are the result of changes in the circumstances of individual loans such as charge offs  pay offs  changes in collateral values or other factors 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount necessary to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
due to the uncertainty of risks in the loan portfolio  management s judgment of the amount of the allowance necessary to absorb loan losses is approximate 
the allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and may be adjusted in response to a determination by the regulatory agencies as to its adequacy in comparison with peer institutions 
we make specific allowances for each impaired loan based on its type and classification as discussed above 
at year end  our allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans decreased to from at year end we have assessed these loans for collectability and considered  among other things  the borrower s ability to repay  the value of the underlying collateral  and other market conditions to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
we also maintain a general reserve for each loan type in the loan portfolio 
in determining the amount of the general reserve portion of our allowance for loan losses  management considers factors such as our historical loan loss experience  the growth  composition and diversification of our loan portfolio  current delinquency levels  the results of recent regulatory examinations and general economic conditions 
based on these factors  we apply estimated percentages to the various categories of loans  not including any loan that has a specific allowance allocated to it  based on our historical experience  portfolio trends and economic and industry trends 
this information is used by management to set the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan losses at a level it deems prudent 
our portfolio is comprised primarily of loans secured by real estate 
a decline in the value of the real estate serving as collateral for our loans may impact our ability to collect those loans 
in general  we obtain updated appraisals on property securing our loans when circumstances are warranted such as at the time of renewal or when market conditions have significantly changed 
we use qualified licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors 
these appraisers possess prerequisite certifications and knowledge of the local and regional marketplace 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to our board of directors  indicating any change in the allowance for loan losses since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance for loan losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as events change 
we increased the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding to at december  from at december  the level of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from these estimates 
we follow a loan grading program designed to evaluate the credit risk in our loan portfolio 
through this loan grading process  we maintain an internally classified watch list which helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans categorized as watch list loans show warning elements where the present status exhibits one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
we review these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s repayment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  loans are categorized as special mention  substandard or doubtful 
loans classified as special mention do not have all of the characteristics of substandard or doubtful loans 
they have one or more deficiencies which warrant special attention and which corrective action  such as accelerated collection practices  may remedy 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition which may jeopardize the repayment of the debt as contractually agreed 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable 
during  our internal process for assigning loan grades did not always establish an accurate grade for credit risk 
our internal control processes surrounding loan grades  which consist of a combination of internal and external loan review activities  identified and corrected grades for the majority of loans that were not initially graded correctly 
however  such loan review did not sufficiently cover all loans subject to potential grading error throughout the year 
in preparing our annual report on form k  we identified the extent to which our loan review controls did not operate and expanded the scope to cover the remainder of the portfolio and adjusted our allowance for loan losses to take the additional findings into consideration 
once a loan is deemed impaired or uncollectible as contractually agreed  the loan is charged off either partially or in full against the allowance for loan losses  based upon the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of collateral less estimated cost to sell with respect to collateral based loans 
as of december   we had million of loans classified as substandard   classified as doubtful  million classified as special mention and none classified as loss 
this compares with million of loans classified as substandard   classified as doubtful  million classified as special mention and none classified as loss as of december  the million increase in loans classified as substandard is primarily attributable to the migration of classified loans through the collection process 
as of december   we had allocations of million in the allowance for loan losses related to these classified loans 
this compares to allocations of million in the allowance for loan losses related to classified loans at december  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december   compared with million for and million for the total allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans at december   compared with million or of total loans at december   and million or of total loans at december  the increased allowance is consistent with the increase in our classified loans of million from december  to december   increased loan charge offs  and trends within the portfolio  in particular the protracted slowdown in housing unit sales and continued weakness in demand for residential land in our markets 
net charge offs were million for the year ended december   compared with million for and million for charge offs for were concentrated in the loans secured by real estate category of the portfolio 
in fact  net charge offs for loans secured by real estate increased from million in to million in this represents of our net charge offs for these net charge offs consisted of million of commercial real estate loans  million of residential real estate loans  and million of construction and land development loans 
the continued weakness in the real estate sector of the market continued to exert downward pressure on the value of real estate securing our loans 
we continue to closely monitor real estate values for property that secures our loans to ensure our allowance is adequate 
the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance funding and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors 
since these factors and management s assumptions are subject to change  the allocation is not necessarily predictive of future portfolio performance

mortgage backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages 
these securities are issued by federal agencies such as government national mortgage association ginnie mae  fannie mae and freddie mac  as well as non agency company issuers 
these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings  and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest 
cash flows from agency backed mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
mortgage backed securities that are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  those securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average life of this security will not be shortened 
if interest rates begin to fall  prepayments will increase 
non agency issuer mortgage backed securities do not carry a government guarantee 
we limit our purchases of these securities to bank qualified issues with high credit ratings 
we regularly monitor the performance and credit ratings of these securities and evaluate these securities  as we do all of our securities  for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
at december   of the agency mortgage backed securities we held had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of years 
in december  based upon relevant market information  we determined that our basis in twelve equity securities with an unrealized loss position for more the months was not recoverable in the near term 
therefore  during  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge totaling  for these securities which had an adjusted cost basis of  the company held equity securities at december  management monitors the underlying financial condition of the issuers and current market pricing for these equity securities monthly 
at december   we had no equity securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses 
as of december   management does not believe any of the debt securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses should be classified as other than temporarily impaired 
deposits we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years  we have been required by market conditions to rely increasingly on short to mid term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives  including brokered and wholesale deposits  which are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of their use on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
we primarily rely on our banking office network to attract and retain deposits in our local markets and leverage our online ascencia division to attract out of market deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
during  total deposits decreased million compared with during  total deposits decreased million compared with the decrease in deposits for and was primarily in certificates of deposit balances and money market accounts 
to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from continually changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins along with other pertinent economic data 
we continue to offer attractively priced deposit products along our product line to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during various rising and falling interest rate cycles 
we offer savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed rate certificates with varying maturities 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
our management adjusts interest rates  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties on our deposit products periodically 
the variety of deposit products allows us to compete more effectively in obtaining funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into outside investment alternatives 
however  our ability to attract and maintain deposits and the costs of these funds has been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions

advances from the fhlb are secured by our stock in the fhlb  certain commercial real estate loans and substantially all of our first mortgage residential loans 
at december   we had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and the capacity to increase our borrowings an additional million 
the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions

the subordinated debentures  which mature february   april   and march   are redeemable before the maturity date at our option on or after march   june   and march   respectively  at their principal amount plus accrued interest 
we have the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
after such period  we must pay all deferred interest and resume quarterly interest payments or we will be in default 
deferring interest payments on our junior subordinated notes resulted in the deferral of distributions on our trust preferred securities 
we will be prohibited from paying cash dividends on our common stock until such time as we have paid all deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities issued by our subsidiary trusts are currently included in our tier capital for regulatory purposes 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted final rules that continue to allow trust preferred securities to be included in tier capital  subject to stricter quantitative and qualitative limits 
currently  no more than of our tier i capital can consist of trust preferred securities and qualifying perpetual preferred stock 
to the extent the amount of our trust preferred securities exceeds the limit  the excess would be includable in tier capital 
the new quantitative limits were effective march  as of december   porter bancorp s trust preferred securities totaled of its tier capital 
each of the trusts issuing the trust preferred securities holds junior subordinated debentures we issued with a year maturity 
the final rules provide that in the last five years before the junior subordinated debentures mature  the associated trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital and included in tier capital 
in addition  the trust preferred securities during this five year period would be amortized out of tier capital by one fifth each year and excluded from tier capital completely during the year before maturity 
liquidity liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
liquidity risk management also involves ensuring that we meet our cash flow needs at a reasonable cost 
we maintain an investment and funds management policy  which identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
our asset liability committee continually monitors and reviews our liquidity position 
funds are available from a number of sources  including the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  principal pay downs on loans and mortgage backed securities  customer deposit inflows  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding 
during and  we utilized brokered and wholesale deposits to supplement our funding strategy 
at december   these deposits totaled million compared with million at december  we are currently restricted from accepting  renewing  or rolling over brokered deposits without the prior receipt of a waiver on a case by case basis from our regulators 
the following table shows at december   the amount of our brokered certificates of deposit by time remaining to maturity in thousands three months or less three months through six months six months through twelve months over twelve months total traditionally  we have borrowed from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we had an unused borrowing capacity with the fhlb of million 
subsequent to year end  as a result of our recent financial results  the fhlb changed our collateral arrangements from a blanket pledge of residential mortgage loans to a detailed loan listing requirement 
our borrowing capacity under the detailed loan listing requirement is based on the market value of the underlying pledged loans rather than the unpaid principal balance of the pledged loans 
the listing requirement also increases the level of collateral required for borrowings 
we are working with the fhlb to finalize the loans in our borrowing base under the listing requirement and understand that our borrowing capacity will be at significantly lower levels until our financial performance improves 
we also secured federal funds borrowing lines from major correspondent banks totaling million on an unsecured basis 
management believes our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future  however  the availability of these lines could be affected by our financial position 
we are also subject to fdic interest rate restrictions for deposits 
as such  we are permitted to offer up to the national rate plus basis points as published weekly by the fdic 
we use cash to pay dividends on common stock  if and when declared by the board of directors  and to service debt 
the main sources of funding include dividends paid by pbi bank  management fees received from pbi bank and affiliated banks and financing obtained in the capital markets 
during  porter bancorp contributed million to its subsidiary  pbi bank  which substantially decreased its liquid assets 
the contribution was made to strengthen the bank s capital in an effort to help it comply with its capital ratio requirements under the consent order 
liquid assets decreased from million at december   to million at december  since the bank is unlikely to be in a position to pay dividends to the parent company for the foreseeable future  cash inflows for the parent are limited to management fees from affiliate banks  earnings on investment securities  sales of investment securities  and interest on deposits with the bank 
these cash inflows along with the liquid assets held at december   are needed to cover ongoing operating expenses of the parent company which have been reduced and are budgeted at million for the reduction in budgeted expenses from actual expenses for is primarily the result of deferring payments on our series a preferred stock issued to the us treasury and on our trust preferred securities 
parent company liquidity could be improved if a capital raise was accomplished

capital in the fourth quarter of  we began deferring the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on our series a preferred stock issued to the us treasury 
if we defer dividend payments for six quarters  the holder of our series a preferred stock currently the us treasury would then have the right to appoint representatives to our board of directors 
we will continue to accrue any deferred dividends  which will be deducted from income to common shareholders for financial statement purposes 
in addition  effective with the fourth quarter of  we began deferring interest payments on our junior subordinated notes with resulted in a deferral of distributions on our trust preferred securities  therefore  future cash dividends on our common stock are subject to the prior payment of all deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities 
stockholders equity decreased million to million at december   compared with million at december  the decrease was due to the net loss and to dividends declared on common stock  cumulative preferred stock  and participating preferred stock 
in  we completed a million private placement to accredited investors 
following completion of the transactions involved  porter bancorp had issued i  shares of common stock  ii  shares of series c preferred stock and iii warrants to purchase to purchase  shares of non voting common stock at a price of per share 
the series c preferred stock has no voting rights except when required by law  has a liquidation preference over our common stock  and dividend rights equivalent to our common stock 
each share of series c preferred stock automatically converts into shares of common stock at such time as  after giving effect to the automatic conversion  the holder of such series c preferred stock together with its affiliates and any other persons with which it is acting in concert or whose holdings would otherwise be required to be aggregated for purposes of federal banking law beneficially holds  directly or indirectly  less than of the number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding 
the warrants are exercisable into non voting common stock until they expire on september  the non voting common stock has no voting rights except when required by law  but otherwise has the same dividend and other rights as our common stock 
upon issuance  each share of non voting common stock automatically converts into shares of common stock at such time as  after giving effect to the automatic conversion  the holder of non voting common stock together with its affiliates and any other persons with which it is acting in concert or whose holdings would otherwise be required to be aggregated for purposes of federal banking law holds  directly or indirectly  beneficially less than of the number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding 
on november   we issued to the us treasury  in exchange for aggregate consideration of million   shares of our series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock for per share 
the warrant is immediately exercisable and has a year term 
the series a preferred stock qualifies as tier capital and pays cumulative cash dividends quarterly at an annual rate of for the first five years  and thereafter 
the series a preferred stock is non voting except when required by law and  beginning on february   may be redeemed by the company at  per share plus accrued unpaid dividends 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to a holding company by its subsidiary banks without prior approval 
these laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
during  the amount available to be paid by pbi bank to porter bancorp would be earnings to date 
however  pbi bank has agreed with its primary regulators to obtain their written consent prior to declaring or paying any future dividends 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established risk based capital requirements for banking organizations 
see item business supervision and regulation porter bancorp capital adequacy requirements and pbi bank capital requirements 
in addition  pbi bank has agreed with its primary regulators to maintain a ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets total risk based capital ratio of at least  and a ratio of tier capital to total assets leverage ratio of 
the following table shows the ratios of tier capital and total capital to risk adjusted assets and the leverage ratios for porter bancorp and pbi bank at december  regulatory minimums well capitalized minimums minimum capital ratios under consent order porter bancorp pbi bank tier capital n a total risk based capital tier leverage ratio at december   pbi bank s tier leverage ratio declined to which is below the minimum capital ratio required by the consent order and its total risk based capital ratio declined to which is below the minimum capital ratio required by the consent order 
bank regulatory agencies can exercise discretion when an institution does not maintain minimum capital levels or meet the other terms of a consent order 
the agencies may initiate changes in management  issue mandatory directives  impose monetary penalties or refrain from formal sanctions  depending on individual circumstances 
any action taken by bank regulatory agencies could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into various transactions  which  in accordance with gaap  are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit as of december  are summarized below 
since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused  the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements one year or less more than year but less than years years or more but less than years years or more total dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit total standby letters of credit standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
if the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  we would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
commitments to extend credit we enter into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
we minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
we have an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which is comprised of senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points that are sustained for one year 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december  and december  given an instantaneous basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared with an increase of at december  the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios for the year ended december   as calculated using the static shock model approach change in future net interest income change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points basis points we did not run a model simulation for declining interest rates as of december   because the federal reserve effectively lowered the federal funds target rate between to in december therefore  no further short term rate reductions can occur 
as we implement strategies to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates in the future  these strategies will lessen our forecasted base case net interest income in the event of no interest rate changes 
our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules 
it is also influenced by market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  we cannot assure you that assumed repricing rates will approximate our actual future activity

this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
any gap analysis has inherent shortcomings because certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change
