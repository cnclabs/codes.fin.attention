item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we own and operate restaurants located in states 
we offer freshly prepared food  attentive service  and a contemporary ambiance that create a satisfying yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with which we compete 
our high volume upscale casual restaurants feature a diverse selection of mainstream american favorites as well as a variety of appetizers and entrees with an international influence  including an extensive selection of sushi items 
our menu items are freshly prepared and incorporate over signature sauces and dressings that we make from scratch  creating broad based appeal for the lifestyle and taste trends of a diverse group of guests 
we believe that our diverse menu and generous portions  combined with an average check of approximately per guest  offers our guests an attractive price value proposition 
the restaurant industry is significantly affected by changes in economic conditions  discretionary spending patterns  consumer confidence  and other factors 
customer traffic and sales patterns have shown improvement throughout and as evidenced by our positive comparable restaurant sales for the previous five quarters and eight consecutive quarters of positive guest traffic 
for  our comparable restaurant sales increased compared to the prior year period increase of 
we believe continued improvement in consumer confidence and spending in general  will be important and necessary catalysts to drive guest traffic and higher guest check averages in casual dining restaurants in general and our restaurants in particular 
as part of our ongoing profitability initiatives  we closed our west palm beach  florida and sugar land  texas restaurants during the third quarter of the decision to close these restaurants was based on these restaurants past and present operating performance and projected future results and is consistent with our strategy to eliminate unprofitable locations 
the closure of these two underperforming restaurants enables us to focus on our existing restaurant portfolio while also allowing us to concentrate on developing new restaurants and remodel existing restaurants 
as a result of the restaurant closures  all historical operating results as well as lease termination and exit costs attributable to these restaurants are reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
we opened one restaurant in october and four restaurants during we target our restaurants to achieve an average annual unit volume of million following months of operations 
our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as guests discover our concept and we generate market awareness 
we experience various patterns in our operating cost structure 
cost of sales  labor  and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least months generally trend consistent with restaurant sales  and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will take approximately six months to achieve operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with opening new restaurants  including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees  as well as other factors 
we expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant  but to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating that unit 
occupancy and a portion of restaurant operating expenses are fixed 
as a result  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses measured as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the majority of our general and administrative costs are fixed costs 
we expect our general and administrative spending to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as we leverage these investments and realize the benefits of higher sales volumes 
key measures we use to evaluate our company key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following number of restaurant openings 
number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period 
same store sales percentage change 
same store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating the percentage change in same store sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
same store sales results for the comparable restaurant base include the results of closed restaurants for quarters during which they were in operation for the entire quarter 
same store sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount 
menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount 
average weekly sales 
average weekly sales represents the average of restaurant sales measured over consecutive monday through sunday time periods 
average unit volume 
average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
sales per square foot 
sales per square foot represents the restaurant sales for our comparable restaurant base  divided by the total leasable square feet for such restaurants 
restaurant operating profit 
restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  or preopening expenses 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance prior to application of corporate overhead 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors 
this measure provides useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations and allows investors to more easily determine future financial results driven by growth and allows investors to more easily compare restaurant level profitability 
key financial definitions restaurant sales 
restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales  net of promotions and discounts 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of food and beverage costs 
labor 
labor includes all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations

we record tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense over the initial term of the lease 
restaurant operating expenses

preopening expense consists of costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and is comprised principally of manager salaries and relocation  payroll and related training costs for new employees  including food and beverage costs associated with practice and rehearsal of service activities  and rent expense incurred from the date we obtain possession of the property until opening 
we expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred  and we expect preopening expenses to be similar for each new restaurant opening  which typically commence six to eight months prior to a restaurant opening 
our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened  the timing of new restaurant openings  the location of the restaurants  and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net consists of interest earned on our cash and investments and any gains or losses on our investments

financial performance overview the following table sets forth certain information regarding our financial performance for   and year ended december  restaurant sales growth same store sales percentage change average unit volume in thousands sales per square foot restaurant operating profit in thousands restaurant operating profit as a percentage of sales same store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating the percentage change for same store sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
includes only those restaurants in the comparable restaurant base 
restaurant operating profit is not a financial measurement determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to income loss from operations 
restaurant operating profit may not be comparable to the same or similarly titled measures computed by other companies 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors

similar to many restaurant chains  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
we are typically required to expend cash to perform site related work and to construct and equip each restaurant 
the average investment cost for our restaurants depends upon the type of lease entered into  the amount of tenant improvement allowance we receive from landlords  and whether we assume responsibility for the construction of the building 
we expect the cash investment cost of our typical restaurant to be approximately million  net of landlord tenant improvement allowances of between million and million  and excluding cash preopening expenses of approximately million 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  permitting requirements  labor markets and other variables 
restaurants that are subject to ground leases and do not receive landlord tenant improvement allowances typically require a significantly higher cash investment 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
the following tables set forth  as of the dates and for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements amounts in thousands december  cash and short term investments net working capital deficit the working capital deficit at december  is primarily attributable to accruals for payroll and lease termination costs related to our two closed restaurants 
the working capital deficit at december  is primarily attributable to accruals for payroll and professional fees 
year ended december  cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of new restaurants  have historically been significant  although such costs have been lower in recent periods  as we opened one new restaurant in and none since the beginning of over the last several years  we funded development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of equity financing and cash flows from operations 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of our restaurants  the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and the credit market environment 
our current operations generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations and general and administrative costs 
we believe existing cash and short term investments of million  the availability to draw on our million credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund any development of new restaurants  planned remodels of existing restaurants and lease termination costs for one restaurant we closed in september as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million  a decrease of million from december   as a result of cash flows generated from operations during we plan to reduce this deficit further through cost containment efforts and cash flow from operations 
credit facility on february   we entered into loan agreements with stearns bank national association the lender for a term loan and a line of credit collectively  the loans 
pursuant to the terms of a business loan agreement  addendum to business loan agreement and promissory note collectively  the term loan agreement  we obtained a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of million the term loan 
the term loan will mature on february  interest on the term loan is subject to change based on changes in the wall street journal prime rate the index 
interest on the unpaid principal balance of the promissory note will be calculated using a rate of over the index and shall at all times be at least per year or higher 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to pay off the remaining balance of our equipment loans and pay expenses associated with the loans 
pursuant to the terms of another business loan agreement  addendum to business loan agreement and promissory note collectively  the credit line agreement  we obtained a credit line to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of million the credit line 
the final maturity date for all installments under the credit line is february  interest on the loans will initially be per year and will be adjusted each time the index changes and on each such date  the interest rate will equal the index plus 
the interest rate shall at all times be at least per year or higher 
there is no non usage fee associated with the credit line 
to the extent we utilize the credit line  amounts borrowed would be used for capital expenditures for existing and new restaurant units  provided that we match each disbursement dollar for dollar and the amount of any such disbursement could not exceed million per location 
the loans also require us to comply with certain covenants set forth in the operative documents governing the terms of the loans 
among other things  the covenants a require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than  b require us to maintain a maximum ibd ebitda ratio of x and c provide that the ratio of our total debt to tangible net worth may not exceed the loans are secured by commercial security agreements executed by us and each of our subsidiaries the companies granting the lender a security interest in all of the assets of the companies 
equipment loans as of december   we had two equipment term loans with a lender  each collateralized by restaurant equipment 
these equipment loans were paid off during february using the proceeds of the term loan discussed above 
the outstanding principal balance under these loans was  at december  the loans bore interest at rates ranging from to and required monthly principal and interest payments aggregating approximately  stock repurchase and retirement program during november  our board of directs approved a stock repurchase and retirement program under which we were authorized to purchase up to million of common stock 
as of february   we completed the stock repurchase and retirement program 
under the program  we purchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the past three years in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash in the net increase of million in cash provided by operating activities during compared to is primarily the result of higher net income and an increase in accrued expenses partially offset by a reduction in deferred rent 
the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities for in comparison to is primarily the result of the timing of vendor payments and the collection of tenant improvement allowances from our landlords 
investing activities 
we fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodels primarily with cash and investments 
during  capital expenditures were million and primarily consisted of contractor payments for our baltimore restaurant that opened during october and remodeling costs for existing restaurants 
capital expenditures for were million primarily attributable to the funding of construction for our baltimore restaurant and contractor payments for two restaurants that were opened during the second half of investing activities for also reflects the sale of million in auction rate securities and million in other investments 
net cash used in investing activities during was million  primarily reflecting million to fund construction of four restaurants opened during financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  reflecting million in shares purchased under our million stock repurchase program and million in principal payments on equipment loans  partially offset by million in proceeds from stock issued as part of our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
net cash used in financing activities was million during reflecting the repayment of million in borrowings under a previous line of credit with ubs and million in principal payments on equipment loans 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during reflecting million in net borrowings under a line of credit and million in net proceeds from a subscription rights offering completed during june  partially offset by million in principal payments on equipment loans 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term notes payable  including current portion interest on notes payable operating leases total the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
in addition  the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
we have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations as defined in the sec final rule no 
 disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation  and we select useful lives that reflect the estimated economic lives of the underlying assets 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
we capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
we are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgment by management  which may produce different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
we evaluate property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in restaurant operating results indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes in legal factors or in the business climate 
the assessment of impairment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
the recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if indicators of impairment are present and if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the restaurant assets  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
during  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges for six underperforming restaurants and subsequently closed two of those restaurants during we continue to monitor the operating performance of each individual restaurant 
we may be required to record impairment charges in the future if certain restaurants perform below expectations 
leasing activities we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the future minimum lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which typically begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period 
we record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the realization of tax benefits of deductible temporary differences and operating loss or tax credit carryforwards will depend on whether we have sufficient taxable income within the carryback and carryforward periods permitted by the tax law to allow for utilization of the deductible amounts and carryforwards 
significant management judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
we evaluate our ability to recover the deferred tax assets and weigh available positive and negative evidence based on its objectivity and subjectivity 
such evidence include the existence of a three year cumulative loss and past operating results 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions about the amount of future federal and state pre tax operating and non operating income and the reversal of temporary differences 
these plans and projections require us to make estimates about a number of factors  including future revenues  prices  inflation and capital spending 
as of december   we continue to believe that a valuation allowance for all us federal and state deferred tax assets is necessary based on the cumulative loss incurred in the past three years 
consideration is given to all available evidence  both positive and negative  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
due to our historical losses  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of stock option awards  which requires the use of a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends  and expected term 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
we also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
we are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms
