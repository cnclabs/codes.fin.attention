the information contained in this report may contain forward looking statements  including statements relating to univest corporation of pennsylvania the corporation and its financial condition and results of operations that involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the corporation s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated  projected  expected or projected as discussed in forward looking statements 
a discussion of forward looking statements and factors that might cause such a difference includes those discussed in item business  item a

critical accounting policies management  in order to prepare the corporation s financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the corporation s financial statements 
there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions 
certain critical accounting policies  discussed below  could materially affect the results of operations and financial position of the corporation should changes in circumstances require a change in related estimates or assumptions 
the corporation has identified the fair value measurement of investment securities available for sale and assessment for impairment of certain investment securities  reserve for loan and lease losses  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights  deferred tax assets and liabilities  benefit plans and stock based compensation as areas with critical accounting policies 
fair value measurement of investment securities available for sale and assessment for impairment of certain investment securities the corporation designates its investment securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
each of these designations affords different treatment in the statement of operations and statement of financial condition for market value changes affecting securities that are otherwise identical 
should evidence emerge that indicates that management s intent or ability to manage the securities as originally asserted is not supportable  securities in the held to maturity or available for sale designations may be re categorized so that either statement of financial position or statement of operations adjustments may be required 
fair values for securities are determined using independent pricing services and market participating brokers 
the corporation s independent pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade  bid and other market information for structured securities  cash flow and  when available  loan performance data 
because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis  the pricing service s evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes  such as benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings  and matrix pricing  to prepare evaluations 
if at any time  the pricing service determines that it does have not sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security  the corporation will utilize valuations from another pricing service 
management has a sufficient understanding of the third party service s valuation models  assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control 
management evaluates debt securities  which comprise of u 
s 
government  government sponsored agencies  municipalities  corporate bonds and other issuers  for other than temporary impairment and considers the current economic conditions  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  interest rates and the bond rating of each security 
all of the debt securities are rated as investment grade and management believes that it will not incur any losses  except for one corporate bond with a downgraded rating and is closely monitored by management 
the unrealized losses on the corporation s investments in debt securities are temporary in nature since they are primarily related to market interest rates and are not related to the underlying credit quality of the issuers within our investment portfolio 
the corporation does not have the intent to sell the debt securities and believes it is more likely than not  that it will not have to sell the securities before recovery of their cost basis 
the credit portion of any loss on debt securities is recognized through earnings and the noncredit portion of any loss related to debt securities that the corporation does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that the corporation will not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the corporation evaluates its equity securities for other than temporary impairment and recognizes other than temporary impairment charges when it has determined that it is probable that certain equity securities will not regain market value equivalent to the corporation s cost basis within a reasonable period of time due to a decline in the financial stability of the underlying companies 
management evaluates the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment and the corporation s positive intent and ability to hold these securities until recovery to the corporation s cost basis occurs 

table of contents reserve for loan and lease losses reserves for loan and lease losses are provided using techniques that specifically identify losses on impaired loans and leases  estimate losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases  and estimate the amount of unallocated reserve necessary to account for losses that are present in the loan and lease portfolio but not yet currently identifiable 
the adequacies of these reserves are sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may affect the ability of borrowers to make contractual payments as well as the value of the collateral committed to secure such payments 
rapid or sustained downturns in the economy may require increases in reserves that may negatively impact the corporation s results of operations and statements of financial condition in the periods requiring additional reserves 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets have been recorded on the books of the corporation in connection with its acquisitions 
the corporation completes a goodwill impairment analysis at least on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
the corporation elected to early adopt  during the fourth quarter of  new accounting guidance which provides entities the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the corporation  including each of its reporting units  is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the corporation performs this assessment at the reporting unit level including the bank  univest insurance and univest investments 
the corporation identifies the significant drivers of fair value including macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions  overall financial performance  management s knowledge of the business  key assumptions used in the most recent fair value determination and assumptions at the time of acquisition 
as part of this analysis  the corporation considers the results of the most recent fair value determination performed as of october    including the amount of excess between the unit s fair value and its carrying amount  and changes in the reporting unit and the economic environment in which it operates 
the corporation performs a qualitative assessment of the likely impact of the factors on the fair value of the reporting unit and considers what events and circumstances have occurred that may have impacted the drivers of fair value 
the corporation considers the overall financial performance of the reporting unit  including current and projected earnings  funding resources  cashflows  salary and benefits expense  capital and tangible capital as well as changes in management and customers  general economic conditions and the regulatory environment 
the corporation considers the reporting unit s performance in comparison to its peers and recent merger and acquisition data including trading multiplies of independent publicly traded entities of comparable sizes 
the corporation also considers changes in its stock price and in comparison to the banking industry 
during  the corporation determined based on the assessment of these qualitative factors and events and circumstances that may impact the drivers of fair value  it was not more likely than not  that the fair value of the corporation and each of the reporting units was less than its carrying amount  therefore  it was not necessary to perform the two step impairment test for the corporation or the reporting units 
the corporation will perform the two step impairment test as described below when the qualitative assessment indicates a material negative impact of the factors on the operating performance or cashflows of the corporation and its reporting units which would more likely than not  result in the fair value of the corporation  including its reporting units  being less than its carrying amount 
there can be no assurance that future impairment analyses will not result in a charge to earnings 
the corporation completed a goodwill impairment test as of october  the corporation s two step impairment testing of goodwill is described as follows 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the corporation employs general industry practices in evaluating the fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units  which are generally the bank  univest investments and univest insurance 
after this allocation is completed  a two step valuation process is applied 
for the bank  in step  fair value is determined based on a market approach  which measures fair value based on trading multiples of independent publicly traded entities of comparable sizes 
a second fair value analysis is performed using the income approach 
the corporation utilizes a net present value of cash flows of projected net income based on the compound annual growth rate of equity and a discount rate 
the discount rate is calculated by utilizing the cost of equity and the cost of debt methods 
if the fair value of the bank exceeds its adjusted book value  no write down of goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its adjusted book value  a step valuation procedure is required to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the valuation procedures applied in a step valuation are similar to those that would be performed upon an acquisition  with the step fair value representing a hypothetical reporting unit purchase price 
if the current market value does not exceed the net book value  impairment exists which requires an impairment charge to noninterest expense 
in its two step impairment analysis of goodwill for univest insurance  inc and univest investments  inc  the corporation utilizes a net present value of cash flows of projected net income based on the compound annual growth rate of equity and a discount rate 
the discount rate is calculated by utilizing the cost of equity and the cost of debt methods 
a second fair value analysis is performed using the market approach which measures fair value based on trading multiples of independent publicly traded entities of comparable sizes 
the fair value that is calculated is compared to the net book value 
table of contents of each company 
if the fair value exceeds the net book value  no impairment exists 
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its adjusted book value  a step valuation procedure is required to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the valuation procedures applied in a step valuation are similar to those that would be performed upon an acquisition  with the step fair value representing a hypothetical reporting unit purchase price 
if the current market value does not exceed the net book value  impairment exists which requires an impairment charge to noninterest expense 
for other identifiable intangible assets  changes in the useful life or economic value of acquired assets may require a reduction in the asset value carried on the financial statements of the corporation and a related charge in the statement of operations 
such changes in asset value could result from a change in market demand for the products or services offered by an acquired business or by reductions in the expected profit margins that can be obtained through the future delivery of the acquired product or service line 
mortgage servicing rights the corporation has mortgage servicing rights for mortgages it originated  subsequently sold and retained servicing 
the value of the rights is booked as income when the corresponding mortgages are sold 
the income booked at sale is the estimated present value of the cash flows that will be received from servicing the loans over the entire future term 
the term of a servicing right can be reasonably estimated using prepayment assumptions of comparable assets priced in the secondary market 
as mortgage rates being offered to the public decrease  the life of loan servicing rights tends to shorten  as borrowers have increased incentive to refinance 
shortened loan servicing lives require changes in the value of the servicing rights that have already been recorded to be marked down in the statement of operations of the servicing company 
this may cause a material change in reported operations for the corporation depending on the size of the servicing portfolio and the degree of change in the prepayment speed of the type and coupon of loans being serviced 
deferred tax assets and liabilities the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credits 
enacted tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on expected taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is anticipated to be realized 
future tax rate changes could occur that would require the recognition of income or expense in the statement of operations in the period in which they are enacted 
deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if in management s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized 
management may need to modify their judgments in this regard from one period to another should a material change occur in the business environment  tax legislation  or in any other business factor that could impair the corporation s ability to benefit from the asset in the future 
benefit plans the corporation has a retirement plan that it provides as a benefit to employees hired before december  and former employees 
the corporation also provides supplemental retirement plans that it provides as a benefit to certain current and former executives 
determining the adequacy of the funding of these plans may require estimates of future salary rate increases  of long term rates of investment return  and the use of an appropriate discount rate for the obligation 
changes in these estimates and assumptions due to changes in the economic environment or financial markets may result in material changes in the corporation s results of operations or statement of financial condition 
stock based compensation the fair value of share based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the corporation uses the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant 
the black scholes model estimates the fair value of employee stock options using a pricing model which takes into consideration the exercise price of the option  the expected life of the option  the current market price and its expected volatility  the expected dividends on the stock and the current risk free interest rate for the expected life of the option 
the corporation s estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested 
the corporation grants stock options to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock is equivalent to the fair value on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period 
readers of the corporation s financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the corporation s current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances  business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the corporation at that time 
general the corporation earns its revenues primarily through its subsidiaries  from the margins and fees it generates from the loan and lease and depository services it provides as well as from trust fees and insurance and investment commissions 
the corporation seeks to achieve adequate and reliable earnings by growing its business while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk to board of directors approved levels 
growth is pursued through expansion of current customer relationships and development of additional relationships with new offices and strategically related acquisitions 
the corporation has also taken steps in recent years to reduce its dependence on net interest income by intensifying its focus on fee based income from trust  insurance  and investment services to customers 

table of contents the principal component of earnings for the corporation is net interest income  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets  is affected by several factors including market interest rates  economic conditions  loan and lease demand  and deposit activity 
as interest rates increase  fixed rate assets that banks hold will tend to decrease in value  conversely  as interest rates decline  fixed rate assets that banks hold will tend to increase in value 
the corporation is in a more asset sensitive position  although interest rates are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future  it anticipates increasing interest rates over the longer term  which it expects would benefit its net interest margin 
the corporation seeks to maintain a steady net interest margin and consistent growth of net interest income 
effective as of the close of the business on june  and following receipt of required regulatory approvals  the bank converted from a national bank to a pennsylvania state chartered bank and trust company  as authorized by the national bank act and pennsylvania law

as a state chartered member bank of the federal reserve system  the bank is regulated primarily by the pennsylvania department of banking and the federal reserve bank of philadelphia 
the conversion to a state charter did not have any significant financial or regulatory impact or affect the corporation s current activities or customers

table of contents increased scrutiny of loan credits 
additionally  as more loan approvals are currently being approved at the committee level as opposed to individual relationship managers and as the corporation proactively manages its credit risk given the current economic environment  increased costs for each loan credit are being incurred in connection with the loan approval process  and as a result  a higher level of costs are being deferred

the corporation implemented higher deferred loan origination costs commencing during the fourth quarter of as previously discussed 
equipment expense increased thousand primarily as a result of increased computer software contract expenses 
marketing and advertising expenses increased thousand mainly to support a major brand campaign to position the corporation to take advantage of the disruption in its markets

expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because debt issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties  therefore  the stated yield may not be recognized in future periods 
equity securities have no stated maturity and the current dividend yields may not be recognized in future periods 
the weighted average yield is calculated by dividing income  which has not been tax equated on tax exempt obligations  within each contractual maturity range by the outstanding amount of the related investment

at each three year or five year anniversary date of the mortgages  the interest rate is renegotiated and the term of the loan is extended for an additional three or five years 
at each three year or five year anniversary date of the mortgages  the bank also has the right to require payment in full 
these are included in the due in one to five years category in the table above 
asset quality performance of the entire loan and lease portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by bank management and loan officers 
a number of factors regarding the borrower  such as overall financial strength  collateral values and repayment ability  are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectability of interest for accrual purposes 
when a loan or lease  including a loan or lease impaired  is classified as nonaccrual  the accrual of interest on such a loan or lease is discontinued 
a loan or lease is classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest  even though the loan or lease is currently performing 
a loan or lease may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured 
when a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status  unpaid interest credited to income is reversed 
interest received on nonaccrual loans and leases is either applied against principal or reported as interest income  according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal 
loans or leases are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current  has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt

the related reserve for loan losses was million 
the amount of the specific reserve needed for these credits could change in future periods subject to changes in facts and judgments related to these credits 
specific reserves have been established based on current facts and management s judgments about the ultimate outcome of these credits 
impaired loans and leases decreased million during mainly consisting of decreases in commercial  financial and agricultural of million  construction loans of million and residential real estate loans of million  partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate of million 
charge offs  foreclosures and pay downs exceeded the additions to impaired loans during impaired loans at december  included one large shared national credit to a theatre with an outstanding balance of million 
at december   the credit was secured with sufficient estimated collateral and therefore  there was no specific reserve on this credit 
the theatre continues to be open and operating 
in addition  impaired loans at december  included one large credit which went on non accrual during the third quarter of and is for four separate facilities to a local commercial real estate developer home builder  aggregating to million at december  there is no specific allowance on this credit as the credit was secured with sufficient estimated collateral 
the borrower does not have the resources to develop these properties  therefore  the properties must be sold

management s methodology to determine the adequacy of and the provision to the reserve considers specific credit reviews  past loan and lease loss experience  current economic conditions and trends and the volume  growth  and composition of the loan portfolio 
the reserve for loan and lease losses is determined through a monthly evaluation of reserve adequacy 
this analysis takes into consideration the growth of the loan and lease portfolio  the status of past due loans and leases  current economic conditions  various types of lending activity  policies  real estate and other loan commitments  and significant changes in charge off activity 
nonaccrual loans and leases  and those which are troubled debt restructured  are evaluated individually 
all other loans and leases are evaluated as pools 
based on historical loss experience  loss factors are determined giving consideration to the areas noted in the first paragraph and applied to the pooled loan and lease categories to develop the general or allocated portion of the reserve 
loans are also reviewed for impairment based on discounted cash flows using the loans initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
management also reviews the activity within the reserve to determine what actions  if any  should be taken to address differences between estimated and actual losses 
any of the above factors may cause the provision to fluctuate 
wholesale leasing portfolios were purchased by the bank s subsidiary  univest capital 
the corporation discontinued the practice of purchasing wholesale leasing portfolios during credit losses on these purchased portfolios are largely the responsibility of the seller up to pre set dollar amounts initially equal to to percent of the portfolio purchase amount 
the dollar amount of recourse for purchased portfolios is inclusive of cash holdbacks and purchase discounts 
purchased wholesale leasing portfolios outstanding were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the reserve for loan and lease losses is based on management s evaluation of the loan or lease portfolio under current economic conditions and such other factors  which deserve recognition in estimating loan and lease losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
additions to the reserve arise from the provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations or from the recovery of amounts previously charged off 
loan and lease charge offs reduce the reserve 
loans and leases are charged off when there has been permanent impairment or when in the opinion of management the full amount of the loan and lease  in the case of non collateral dependent borrowings  will not be realized 
certain impaired loans are reported at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
the reserve for loan and lease losses consists of allocated reserve and unallocated reserve categories 
the allocated reserve is comprised of reserves established on specific loans and leases  and class reserves based on historical loan and lease loss experience  current trends  and management assessments 
the unallocated reserve is based on both general economic conditions and other risk factors in the corporation s individual markets and portfolios and is to account for a level of imprecision in management s estimation process and the potential volatility in the aforementioned markets and portfolios 
the specific reserve element is based on a regular analysis of impaired commercial and real estate loans 
for these loans  the specific reserve established is based on an analysis of related collateral value  cash flow considerations and  if applicable  guarantor capacity 

table of contents the class reserve element is determined by an internal loan and lease grading process in conjunction with associated allowance factors 
the corporation revises the class allowance factors whenever necessary  but no less than quarterly  in order to address improving or deteriorating credit quality trends or specific risks associated with a given loan or lease pool classification 
the corporation maintains a reserve in other liabilities for off balance sheet credit exposures that currently are unfunded in categories with historical loss experience

at december  the specific allowance on impaired loans was million  or of the balance of impaired loans and leases of million 
at december   the specific allowance on impaired loans was million  or of the impaired loan and lease balance of million 
management closely monitors the credit worthiness and the value of underlying collateral as a commercial credit becomes past due 
these factors along with historical and economic trends  and management s assumptions  are taken into consideration in providing the allowance for loan and lease losses 
when the loan becomes impaired and is placed on non accrual  a specific allowance is created for the impaired loan 

table of contents the ratio of the reserve for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was at december  compared to at december  allocated reserves at december  decreased by million compared to december  the allocation of the allowance for real estate loans decreased by million at december  compared to december  mainly due to lower construction loan volume  a decrease in the level of criticized commercial real estate construction loans resulting from the migration and resolution of loans through the loan workout process  a decrease in the historical loss factor for non criticized commercial real estate construction loans partially offset by an increase in the historical loss factor for criticized commercial real estate construction loans 
the changes in the historical loss factors for commercial real estate construction loans were primarily due to the migration of loans with losses from the non criticized to criticized category during these previously discussed changes for commercial real estate construction loans resulted in a lower total reserve on non criticized real estate loans partially offset by a higher total reserve on criticized real estate loans at december  compared to december  the allocated reserves for commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased by million at december  compared to december  mainly due an increase in the volume of non criticized loans and to a lesser degree  an increase in the level of criticized loans 
the ratio of the reserve for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was at december  compared to at december  allocated reserves at december  increased by million compared to december  the allocation of the allowance for real estate loans increased by million at december  compared to december  mainly due to an increase in the historical loss factor related to non criticized commercial real estate construction loans which incorporated the corporation s higher level of net charge offs during relative to its previous historical average for these types of loans

on august  and august   the standard poor s rating services downgraded the credit ratings of the u 
s government and federal agencies  including the fhlb  respectively  from aaa to aa  with a negative outlook 
these recent downgrades  and any future downgrades in the credit ratings of the us government and the fhlb could increase the borrowing costs of the fhlb and possibly have a negative impact on its operations and long term performance 
it is possible this could have an adverse effect on the value of the corporation s investment in the fhlb stock 
however  based on current information from the fhlb  management believes that if there is any impairment in the fhlb stock it is temporary 
therefore  as of december   the fhlb stock is recorded at cost

table of contents asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate earnings  capital and liquidity while maintaining an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet cash flow requirements of customers and corporate needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing rates 
the corporation uses both an interest sensitivity gap analysis and a simulation model to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk 
the corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short term rate exposures 
the corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one year horizon 
the simulation uses existing portfolio rate and re pricing information  combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth  future spreads  prepayments on residential mortgages  and the discretionary pricing of non maturity assets and liabilities 
the corporation may use interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics from variable to fixed or fixed to floating in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future net interest income 
the corporation s credit exposure on interest rate swaps includes fair value and any collateral that is held by a third party 
the corporation accounts for its interest rate swap contracts in cash flow hedging relationships by establishing and documenting the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the change in cash flows of assets or liabilities that are being hedged

residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance 
credit risk in the direct consumer loan portfolio and credit card portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider debt to income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and  if secured  collateral values 
in the home equity loan portfolio  combined loan to value ratios at origination are generally limited to 
other credit considerations may warrant higher combined loan to value ratios and are generally insured by private mortgage insurance 
the primary risks that are involved with lease financing receivables are credit underwriting and borrower industry concentrations 
the corporation has strict underwriting  review  and monitoring procedures in place to mitigate this risk 
risk also lies in the residual value of the underlying equipment 
residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers 
to the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party  or otherwise insured against  the corporation bears the risk of ownership of the leased assets 
this includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value 
the corporation greatly reduces this risk by using buyout leases  in which the entire cost of the leased equipment is included in the contractual payments  leaving no residual payment at the end of the lease terms 

table of contents the corporation closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality 
collection efforts begin after a loan payment is missed  by attempting to contact all borrowers 
if collection attempts fail  the corporation will proceed to gain control of any and all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses 
while liquidation and recovery efforts continue  officers continue to work with the borrowers  if appropriate  to recover all monies owed to the corporation 
the corporation monitors delinquency trends and past due reports which are submitted to the board of directors 
liquidity the corporation  in its role as a financial intermediary  is exposed to certain liquidity risks 
liquidity refers to the corporation s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demand for loans and leases and deposit withdrawals 
the corporation manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs 
the corporation has a contingency funding plan in place to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial crisis 
sources of funds core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements repos have historically been the most significant funding sources for the corporation 
these deposits and repos are generated from a base of consumer  business and public customers primarily located in bucks and montgomery counties  pennsylvania 
the corporation faces increased competition for these deposits from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  security dealers and others 
the corporation supplements its core funding with money market funds it holds for the benefit of various trust accounts 
these funds are fully collateralized by the bank s investment portfolio and are at current money market mutual fund rates 
this funding source is subject to changes in the asset allocations of the trust accounts 
the bank may purchase certificates from the pennsylvania local government investment trust plgit to augment its short term fixed funding sources 
the plgit deposits are public funds collateralized with a letter of credit that plgit maintains with the fhlb  therefore  the bank is not required to provide collateral on these deposits 
at december  and  the bank had no plgit deposits 
the corporation  through the bank  has short term and long term credit facilities with the fhlb with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million 
at december  and  total outstanding short term and long term borrowings with the fhlb totaled million 
at december   the bank also had outstanding short term letters of credit with the fhlb totaling million  which were utilized to collateralize seasonal public funds deposits 
the maximum borrowing capacity changes as a function of qualifying collateral assets as well as the fhlb s internal credit rating of the bank and the amount of funds received may be reduced by additional required purchases of fhlb stock 
the bank maintains federal fund credit lines with several correspondent banks totaling million at december  and there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines at december  and million outstanding at december  future availability under these lines is subject to the prerogatives of the granting banks and may be withdrawn at will 
the corporation  through the bank  has an available line of credit at the federal reserve bank of philadelphia  the amount of which is dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral 
at december  and  the corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this line 
cash requirements the corporation has cash requirements including various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that require cash payments 
the following contractual obligations and commitments table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties 
the most significant obligation  in both the under and over one year time period  is for the bank to repay its certificates of deposit 
short term borrowings consisting of securities sold under agreements to repurchase constitute the next largest payment obligation 
the bank anticipates meeting these obligations by continuing to provide convenient depository and cash management services through its branch network  thereby replacing these contractual obligations with similar fund sources at rates that are competitive in our market 
the table also shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
commitments to extend credit are the bank s most significant commitment in both the under and over one year time periods 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the corporation enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and its asset liability management  to fund acquisitions and to meet required capital needs 
these obligations require the corporation to make cash payments over time as detailed in the table below 
the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to manage the corporation s exposure to fluctuation in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby and commercial letters of credit and forward contracts 
these financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contract or notional amounts of these financial instruments reflect the extent of involvement the corporation has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
unless noted otherwise  the corporation does not require and is not required to pledge collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk 
these commitments expire over time as detailed in table the corporation also had possible future commitments on risk participation agreements  totaling million at december  for further information regarding the corporation s commitments  refer to footnote of the consolidated financial statements  herein

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
in the course of its lending  leasing and deposit taking activities  the corporation is subject to changes in the economic value and or earnings potential of these assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates 
the corporation s investment asset liability management committee manages interest rate risk in a manner so as to provide adequate and reliable earnings 
this is accomplished through the establishment of policy limits on maximum risk exposures  as well as the regular and timely monitoring of reports designed to quantify risk and return levels 
the corporation uses both an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and a simulation model to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk 
the corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short term rate exposures 
the corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one year horizon 
the simulation uses existing portfolio rate and re pricing information  combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth  future spreads  prepayments on residential mortgages  and the discretionary pricing of non maturity assets and liabilities 
the corporation is permitted to use interest rate swaps and interest rate caps floors with indices that correlate to on balance sheet instruments  to modify its indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on the corporation s current economic outlook 
at december   the simulation  based upon forward looking assumptions  projects that the corporation s greatest interest margin exposure to interest rate risk would occur if interest rates decreased from present levels 
given the assumptions  a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve applied on a ramp up basis would cause the corporation s net interest margin  over a year horizon  to be approximately more than it would be if market rates would remain unchanged 
a basis point a basis point ramp down would not be relevant in the current market conditions parallel shift in the yield curve applied on a ramp down basis would cause the corporation s net interest margin  over a year horizon  to be approximately less than it would be if market rates would remain unchanged 
policy limits have been established which allow a tolerance for no more than approximately a negative impact to the interest margin resulting from a basis point parallel yield curve shift over a forward looking month period
