item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion updates our plan of operations for the foreseeable future 
it also analyzes our financial condition at december  and compares it to our financial condition at december  the discussion also summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended december   and  and compares each year s results to the results of the prior year 
plan of operation general with the completion of the acquisition of minera andes inc on january   our focus for will be achieving a successful build and startup of phase gold production at the el gallo complex in mexico  advancing the permitting effort for the gold bar project in nevada  continued exploration drilling at the los azules project in san juan  argentina  and initiating new reconnaissance drilling and exploration initiatives in santa cruz  argentina 
we are the owners of minera santa cruz sa msc  which holds title in argentina to the san jos mine  for their focus is on optimizing production and controlling operating costs while significantly increasing exploration efforts 
our estimated production for the company in  on an attributable basis  is million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold 
this estimate excludes production from san jos during the first days of until our acquisition of minera andes was completed 
mexico during the first half of  we expect to complete the infrastructure upgrades and installations required to begin phase gold production at our el gallo complex  including the heap leach pad  adsorption desorption recovery adr processing plant  assay lab  and crushing circuit at a total budgeted cost of million  of which million was spent in and the remainder will be spent during the first half of we anticipate that the mine will be operational at the end of the second quarter 
the expected production rate for phase is  ounces of gold annually with estimated production for of  ounces 
the exploration budget for for el gallo complex and other properties is million 
technical work and resource modeling will continue on phase development at the el gallo complex and we expect to submit permit applications to the mexican authorities during the second half of we expect the environmental review process to take approximately one year 
area and regional exploration efforts will continue throughout we have budgeted million towards phase development in united states we expect to continue to advance the gold bar project through the permitting process during exploration drilling is expected to take place at tonkin  limo and other areas in nevada  as warranted 
further reconnaissance sampling and mapping will continue on our other nevada properties 
we anticipate resumption of the core drilling program at the richardson project in alaska during in spring  as weather permits 
the drilling budget for united states for is million 
argentina the focus at the los azules project will be a core drilling exploration program which began during the first quarter of and will continue until winter arrives at the project site approximately in may 
table of contents and will resume again in the argentine springtime in the fourth quarter of the year 
the drilling efforts are split between infill drilling to upgrade the confidence of the known mineralized material and to target new areas of mineralization  especially to the southwest side of the known deposit where we are targeting geophysical anomalies detected during geophysical surveys completed by minera andes in we have budgeted million towards exploration at the los azules project for we will conduct a thorough review of our owned properties in santa cruz  argentina with extensive sampling and mapping taking place  along with selective drilling of prospective targets 
we have budgeted million towards exploration in santa cruz 
at the san jos mine  we expect production  on a basis  to be approximately million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold which would be generally consistent with production rates over the past two years 
as agreed with our joint venture partner  hochschild mining plc  exploration both at the san jos mine and the surrounding joint venture property area will increase significantly in with a total budget of over million to be spent on drilling 
approximately half of this amount will be spent on brownfield drilling to locate new areas of mineralization 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  comprised of current assets of million  including million of gold and silver bullion  and current liabilities of million 
this represents an increase of approximately million from the working capital of million at fiscal year end december  at december   the fair value of our gold bullion exceeded its book value by approximately million 
for the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded for our silver holdings due to fair value being lower than the carrying value 
in february  we substantially increased our working capital when we issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share  which includes the entire exercise of the underwriters over allotment option of million shares in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement filed with the sec and a prospectus filed with canadian securities regulators 
gross proceeds from the million shares sold in the offering totaled million 
proceeds to us  net of commissions and expenses  were approximately million 
with the acquisition of minera andes on january   our working capital available during increased by approximately million  including a dividend receivable from msc of million  which was received in february we expect to receive further dividends from msc during  although the timing and amount of those dividends will depend upon silver and gold prices  production levels  operating costs  capital expenditures  and a variety of other factors beyond our control 
in addition  we expect to begin operations of phase at the el gallo complex  where we expect to begin generating revenue through mining operations in the third quarter but we can provide no assurance that this timeline will be met or provide guidance on the projected profitability of mining operations 
our working capital at present is sufficient to fund the million remaining budget required for phase development along with ongoing exploration and corporate activities through the end of cash flow generated from mining operations in mexico would be expected to be reinvested in phase development and construction at el gallo 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and from million in  primarily due to increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees 
cash paid to suppliers and employees increased to million for the period from million and million during the and periods respectively  primarily due to increased exploration activities in mexico and nevada and transaction costs associated with the minera andes acquisition 

table of contents cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to additional purchases of gold and silver bullion of million  acquisition of mineral property interests in nevada and mexico of million  additional land and drill rigs purchases of million mostly in mexico  investment in short term canadian treasury bills of million with a maturity of months  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of gold and silver bullion and marketable securities aggregating million 
this compares to cash provided by investing activities in of million  primarily due to the redemption of our short term us and canadian treasury bills of million that matured during the second quarter of  partially offset by additional purchases of gold bullion of million  investment in marketable equity securities of million  mining concessions in mexico of million and property and equipment in mexico of million 
this compares to cash used in of million  primarily due to investment in short term us and canadian treasury bills with maturities between three and six months of million  in gold bullion of million  capital expenditures of milion  which are partially offset by proceeds from disposal of property and equipment from our mexico operations 
cash provided by financing activities for was million from the public offering of million shares and the exercise of stock options  compared to million in the comparable period of cash provided by financing activities in was million  which was primarily due to the public offering of million shares and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations schedule of contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments as of december  to make future payments under certain contracts  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations accounts payable accrued liabilitites asset retirement obligations total results of operations year ended december  compared to general 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million or per share  compared to a net loss for of million or per share 
the increase for the period compared to the period reflected our accelerated exploration efforts in mexico and nevada 
costs and expenses 
general and administrative expense increased by million  from million in to million in the majority of the increase came from costs related to the business combination with minera andes of million  which was completed on january   an increase in stock based compensation expense of million  an increase in salaries and wages of million due to increased staff  an increase in marketing activities of million  an increase in rent and office expenses of million as a result of relocating our head office  and an increase in accounting and tax related costs of million in mexico 

table of contents property holding costs for decreased by million  from million in to million in  mainly due to a receivable of million we recorded from the state of nevada for a refund of claim fees paid to the state 
exploration costs increased by million  from million in to million in  reflecting an increase in exploration activities at the gold bar and limo projects in nevada  and at the el gallo complex in mexico  as well as initiating the richardson project in alaska 
exploration spending in mexico increased by million  from million to million in  which reflected a total of  ft  m of drilling activity in mexico as compared to  ft  m of drilling in the same period in engineering and technical work for the el gallo project was million and included in exploration costs 
during  exploration spending in nevada and alaska increased by million  from million to million 
during the period  a total of  ft  m was drilled in nevada and alaska as compared to  ft  m drilled in the same period in there was no drilling in alaska in since we signed the agreement in july total pre feasibility costs incurred for the gold bar project for the year was million as compared to million for the same period in during  we also incurred million on the construction and development of the el gallo complex in connection with phase development of the project 
these activities include mobilization and demobilization of mining equipment  road construction and management costs to oversee the construction 
as noted in our critical accounting policies  these costs are expensed until proven and probable reserves are established 
total stock based compensation expense increased by million  from million in to million in  reflecting increased expenses associated with stock option grants at the beginning of stock based compensation expense is allocated to the general and administrative and exploration costs lines within the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss 
accretion of the asset retirement obligation in nevada and mexico remained consistent at million in and depreciation costs slightly increased to million in as compared to million in other income expenses 
other expenses totaled million for the year ended december  during the year  we sold  ounces of gold bullion and  ounces of silver bullion  which resulted in a realized gain of million 
we did not sell any gold or silver bullion in the same period in during the year december   we also reported unrealized losses on silver of million as a result of a reduction in the value of silver 
during  we recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of million  as compared to a gain of million in  reflecting a stronger us dollar against the canadian dollar and its effect on our net monetary assets or cash that are denominated in canadian dollars 
year ended december  compared to general 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million or per share  compared to a net loss for of million or per share 
the increase for the period compared to the period reflected our accelerated exploration efforts in mexico and nevada 
costs and expenses 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in  mainly due to an increase in salaries of million due to the increase in staff in mexico and additional listing fees of million on the nyse as a result of us moving from the nyse amex to the nyse on november  
table of contents property holding costs increased to million in from million in  mainly due to an accrual of million in response to the nevada legislature s enactment of assembly bill  which imposed an additional fee on ownership of unpatented mining claims in that state  and partially offset by a credit adjustment of million with respect to the acquisition of mineral property interests in mexico from prior years 
exploration costs increased to million in from million in  reflecting an increase in exploration activities at the gold bar and limo projects in nevada and at the el gallo project in mexico 
total stock based compensation expense increased to million in from million in  reflecting increased expenses associated with stock option grants at the beginning of stock based compensation expense is allocated to the general and administrative and exploration costs lines within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
accretion of the asset retirement obligation in nevada and mexico decreased to million in from million in depreciation costs slightly decreased to million in as compared to million in other income expenses 
during  we recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of million  as compared to million in  reflecting a weakening us dollar against the canadian dollar and its effect on our net monetary assets or cash that are denominated in canadian dollars 
critical accounting policies listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements 
mineral property interests mineral property interests include acquired mineral  development and exploration stage properties  which are considered tangible assets 
the amount capitalized relating to a mineral property interest represents its fair value at the time of acquisition  either as an individual asset purchase or as a part of a business combination 
the value of mineral property interest is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineralized material believed to be contained in the properties 
if a mineable ore body is discovered  the capitalized costs would be amortized when production begins using the units of production method 
exploration costs exploration costs include costs incurred to identify new mineral resources  evaluate potential resources  and convert mineral resources into proven and probable reserves 
exploration costs are expensed as incurred 
proven and probable reserves the definition of proven and probable reserves is set forth in the sec industry guide proven reserves are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geological character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established 
probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observations 
as of december  none of the company s mineralized properties contain resources that meet the definition of proven and probable reserves 

table of contents design  construction  and development costs certain costs to design and construct mining and processing facilities may be incurred prior to establishing proven and probable reserves 
the company classifies the phase development of the el gallo complex as an exploration stage project  and accordingly  substantially all costs  including design  engineering  construction  and installation of equipment are expensed 
development costs are capitalized when proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially minable property 
mine development costs incurred either to develop new ore deposits  expand the capacity of operating mines  or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are capitalized 
costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations 
costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment 
the company evaluates  at least quarterly  the carrying value of capitalized mineral interest costs and related property  plant and equipment costs  if any  to determine if these costs are in excess of their net realizable value and if a permanent impairment needs to be recorded 
the periodic evaluation of carrying value of capitalized costs and any related property  plant and equipment costs are based upon expected future cash flows and or estimated salvage value 
impairment of long lived assets we review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the net book value to the fair value 
when the net book value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is measured and recorded 
the underlying fair value of inactive mining equipment in mexico and inactive milling equipment in nevada were based on the estimated net realizable value 
as at december   the carrying value for these assets is less than their fair value and as a result  no impairment was recorded 
mineral properties are monitored for impairment based on factors such as our continued right to explore the area  exploration reports  assays  technical reports  drill results and our continued plans to fund exploration programs on the property 
we use the market approach to estimate the fair value of the properties by using a combination of the observed market value per square mile in the region and an observed market value per ounce of mineralized material 
we are unable to determine the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from our operations due the nature of our mineralized materials 
as such  the appropriate evidence to perform estimates of future cash flows is not available and would not be accurate in supporting our long lived assets 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  we group our properties by geological mineral complex as this represents the lowest level at which we allocate our exploration spending independent of other assets and liabilities 
for our battle mountain complex  as described in the properties section item  we have separated our properties into three regions  due to their physical separation  for the purposes of impairment testing 
the three regions are north bmx  east slaven canyon and west fish creek 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test on these mineral properties using the market approach to estimate the fair value of the properties by using the observed market value per square mile in the region  calculated in with the assistance of a third party expert  since we believe there were no significant changes to the observed market value 
based on this approach  our carrying values of these mineral properties did not exceed the fair value and as a result no impairment was recorded for the year ended december  asset retirement obligations we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro in the period that it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
ongoing environmental and reclamation expenditures are credited to the aro as incurred to the extent they relate to the aro and to expense to the extent they do not so apply 
the fair value of aros is measured by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit adjusted risk free rate of interest  while taking into account an inflation rate 
we prepare 
table of contents estimates of the timing and amounts of expected cash flows when an aro is incurred  which are updated to reflect changes in facts and circumstances 
changes in regulations or laws  any instances in non compliance with laws or regulations that result in fines  or any unforeseen environmental contamination could result in a material impact to the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation 
significant judgments and estimates are made when estimating the fair value of aros 
expected cash flows relating to aros could occur over long periods of time and the assessment of the extent of environmental remediation work is highly subjective 
considering all of these factors that go into the determination of an aro  the fair value of the aros can materially change over time 
a change in the credit adjusted risk free rate and inflation rate used will not have a material impact on the aro liability balance as the aro amount is not significant in relation to our overall balance sheet 
stock based compensation we account for stock options at fair value as prescribed in asc section we estimate the fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using the black scholes option pricing model and provide for expense recognition over the service period  if any  of the stock option 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets 
this method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the company  as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect 
we derive the deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year 
we record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risks includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in interest rates  equity price risks  commodity price fluctuations  and country risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk 

table of contents foreign currency risk while we transact most of our business in us dollars  some expenses  labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in canadian dollars  mexican pesos  or argentine pesos 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar increases costs and the cost of purchasing capital assets in us dollar terms in canada  mexico and argentina  which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in us dollar terms 
the value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a depreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
we have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we also hold portions of our cash reserves in non us dollar currencies 
based on our canadian cash balance of million at december   a change in the canadian dollar would have an insignificant impact in the statement of operations 
interest rate risk we have no debt outstanding nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time 
equity price risk we have in the past sought and will likely in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common stock 
movements in the price of our common stock have been volatile in the past and may also be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell common stock at an acceptable price to meet future funding requirements 
commodity price risk we currently have production from our interest in the san jos mine  an operating silver gold mine in santa cruz province  argentina 
as a result  changes in the price of gold and silver could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows in the future 
we also hold a portion of our cash in gold and silver bullion  which is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
gold and silver prices may fluctuate widely from time to time 
based on our gold and silver holdings of million at december   a reduction in the price of gold and silver would decrease our working capital by approximately million 
at december   our gold and silver bullion had a combined fair value of million 
foreign country risk our el gallo complex and certain other concessions are located in mexico  and are subject to mexican federal and state laws and regulations 
as a result  our mining investments are subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of business in foreign countries 
in the past  mexico has been subject to political instability  changes and uncertainties which may cause changes to existing government regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities 
civil or political unrest or violence could disrupt our operations at any time 
in  there continues to be a high level of violence and crime relating to drug cartels in sinaloa state  where we operate  and in other regions of mexico 
this may disrupt our ability to carry out exploration and mining activities and affect the safety and security of our employees and contractors 
our exploration and mining activities may be adversely 
table of contents affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that could increase the costs related to our activities or maintaining our properties 
all of minera andes material properties are located in argentina 
there are risks relating to an uncertain or unpredictable political and economic environment in argentina 
during an economic crisis in and  argentina defaulted on foreign debt repayments and on the repayment on a number of official loans to multinational organizations 
in addition  the argentinean government has renegotiated or defaulted on contractual arrangements 
in january  the argentinean government reassessed its policy and practice in respect of export duties and began levying export duties on mining companies operating in the country 
although this particular change does not affect minera andes as its fiscal stability agreement explicitly fixes export duties at for dor bars and for concentrates  there can be no assurance that the argentinean government will not unilaterally take other action which could have a material adverse effect on minera andes interests in argentina  including in particular the san jos mine 
there have been recent indications in argentina that refunds of vat iva may be delayed 
delays in the payment of vat refunds may have an impact on the cash flow from the operations of msc  the operator of the san jos mine 
such reduction in cash flow could affect msc s ability to make timely payments related to the operation of the mine and could require msc to seek additional financing  including from minera andes 
furthermore  in october  argentina announced a decree requiring mining companies to repatriate mining revenues to argentine currency before distributing revenue either locally or overseas 
msc estimated that this would result in an additional million in their annual pre tax operating expenses on a basis as a result of the increased foreign exchange and bank transaction costs caused by the issuance of this decree 
similar unanticipated changes by the argentinean government  could negatively impact the profitability of the san jos mine 
there also is the risk of political violence and increased social tension in argentina as argentina has experienced periods of civil unrest  crime and labor unrest 
certain political and economic events such as acts  or failures to act  by a government authority in argentina  and acts of political violence in argentina  could have a material adverse effect on minera andes ability to operate
