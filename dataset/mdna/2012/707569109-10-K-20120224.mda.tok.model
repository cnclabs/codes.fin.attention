item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our operations we are a leading  diversified  multi jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari mutuel properties 
as of december   we owned  managed  or had ownership interests in twenty five facilities in the following eighteen jurisdictions colorado  florida  illinois  indiana  iowa  louisiana  maine  maryland  mississippi  missouri  nevada  new jersey  new mexico  ohio  pennsylvania  texas  west virginia  and ontario 
we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with diversified cash flow from operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past  and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
in  we began our transition from a pari mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the charles town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in west virginia 
since  we have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions including the acquisitions of hollywood casino bay st 
louis and boomtown biloxi  crc holdings  inc  the bullwhackers properties  hollywood casino corporation  argosy gaming company  zia park casino  sanford orlando kennel club and the m resort in june  greenfield projects such as at hollywood casino at penn national race course  hollywood slots hotel and raceway and hollywood casino perryville  and property expansions such as hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino lawrenceburg 
most recently  we  along with our joint venture partner  opened hollywood casino at kansas speedway on february   and we anticipate opening our facilities in columbus and toledo  ohio in the vast majority of our revenue is gaming revenue  derived primarily from gaming on slot machines and  to a lesser extent  table games  which is highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties 
other revenues are derived from our management service fee from casino rama  our hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities  and our racing operations 
our racing revenue includes our share of pari mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers  our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting  and our share of wagering from our otws 
key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle and table game drop volume indicators and win or hold percentage 
our typical property slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle  and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow  since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines and pari mutuel wagering 
our business is capital intensive  and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt  fund capital maintenance expenditures  fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions 
we continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties  the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties  particularly in attractive regional markets 
current capital projects are ongoing at several of our new and existing properties  including our facilities under construction in ohio 
additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures below 

table of contents segment information during  we realigned our reporting structure in connection with the hiring of a senior vice president of regional operations 
we now have three senior vice presidents of regional operations who oversee various properties based primarily on their geographic locations and whom report directly to our president and chief operating officer 
this event impacted how our chief executive officer  who is the company s codm as that term is defined in asc  measures and assesses our business performance and has caused us to conclude that we now have reportable segments 
therefore  we have aggregated our properties into three reportable segments i midwest  ii east west  and iii southern plains  consistent with how our codm reviews and assesses our financial performance 
the midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties hollywood casino lawrenceburg  hollywood casino aurora  hollywood casino joliet  and argosy casino alton 
it also includes our casino rama management service contract as well as the two ohio properties that are currently under construction  hollywood casino toledo and hollywood casino columbus  which are scheduled to open by the end of may and november   respectively 
the east west reportable segment consists of the following properties hollywood casino at charles town races  hollywood casino perryville  hollywood slots hotel and raceway  hollywood casino at penn national race course  zia park casino  and m resort 
the southern plains reportable segment consists of the following properties argosy casino riverside  argosy casino sioux city  hollywood casino baton rouge  hollywood casino tunica  hollywood casino bay st 
louis  and boomtown biloxi 
it also includes our investment in kansas entertainment  which owns the hollywood casino at kansas speedway which opened in february the other category consists of our standalone racing operations  namely beulah park  raceway park  rosecroft raceway  sanford orlando kennel club  and our joint venture interests in sam houston race park and valley race park  freehold raceway  and maryland jockey club which was sold in july 
if we are successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations  they would be assigned to one of our regional executives and reported in their respective reportable segment 
the other category also includes our corporate overhead operations which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under asc and our bullwhackers property 
executive summary economic conditions continue to impact the overall domestic gaming industry as well as operating results 
we believe that the current economic conditions  including  but not limited to  high unemployment levels  low levels of consumer confidence  weakness in the housing and consumer credit markets and increased stock market volatility  have resulted in reduced levels of discretionary consumer spending compared to historical levels 
in order to mitigate the impact of these conditions  we have increasingly focused on cost management  such as monitoring staff levels and establishing effective marketing programs  to continue to generate strong cash flow 
even though the current economic environment has been challenging  we believe our strengths include our relatively low leverage ratios compared to the regional casino companies that we directly compete with and the ability of our operations to generate positive cash flow 
these two factors have allowed us to develop what we believe to be attractive future growth opportunities in new regional gaming markets 
we have also made investments in joint ventures and certain racetrack operations that we believe may allow us to capitalize on additional gaming opportunities in certain states if legislation or referenda are passed that permit and or expand gaming in these jurisdictions 

table of contents financial highlights the major factors affecting our results for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   were net revenues and income from operations increased by million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  for our east west segment  primarily due to the acquisition of the m resort on june   the opening of hollywood casino perryville on september   and the introduction of table games in july at hollywood casino at charles town races and at hollywood casino at penn national race course 
income from operations at our midwest segment was impacted by a pre tax insurance gain of million at hollywood casino joliet during the year ended december   compared to a pre tax insurance gain of million during the corresponding period in the prior year  and included goodwill and other impairment losses of million during the year ended december  excluding the recently opened hollywood casino perryville and the recently acquired m resort  management s continued focus on cost management contributed to improved operating margins at of our gaming facilities 
our other category included a gain of million on the sale of our interest in the maryland jockey club in july for the year ended december  compared to a loss from our interest in the maryland jockey club for the year ended december   which included our share of a goodwill impairment write down recorded by the maryland jockey club during the fourth quarter of for million 
our other category for the year ended december  also included a loss on the early extinguishment of debt for million related to debt issuance costs write offs and the call premium on the million senior subordinated notes  as well as a million charge for our share of a goodwill impairment write down at our new jersey joint venture 
net income attributable to the shareholders of penn national gaming  inc and its subsidiaries increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the variances explained above and a decrease in interest expense as well as an increase in income taxes 
recent developments the following are recent developments that have had or are likely to have an impact on us in july  we entered into a new billion senior secured credit facility which is comprised of a million revolving credit facility that will mature in july  a million variable rate term loan a due in july and a million variable rate term loan b due in july we utilized the proceeds of the two term loan borrowings and cash on hand to retire our previous senior secured credit facility obligation of  million which had significant principal repayments due at the end of and and pay transaction costs and accrued interest and fees on the retired debt 
as a result of this refinancing  we incurred a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  additionally  in july  we announced our intention to redeem all of our million senior subordinated notes 
the redemption price was  per  principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  which was paid in august we funded the redemption of our million senior subordinated notes from our new revolving credit facility and available cash 
we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended 
table of contents december  related to debt issuance costs write offs and the call premium on the million senior subordinated notes 
following the purchase of all of the outstanding debt of the m resort for million and the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals  we acquired the business in exchange for the debt on june  we purchased all of the outstanding bank and subordinated debt of the m resort in october at which time we also secured the right to acquire the business of the m resort in exchange for the property s outstanding debt obligations 
the hollywood casino columbus project  a million hollywood themed casino in columbus  ohio  inclusive of million in licensing fees  is under construction  with a planned casino opening of up to  slot machines  table games and poker tables  structured and surface parking  as well as food and beverage outlets and an entertainment lounge 
we expect that hollywood casino columbus will open on november  construction is also underway for hollywood casino toledo  a million hollywood themed casino in toledo  ohio  inclusive of million in licensing fees  with a planned casino opening of  slot machines  table games and poker tables  structured and surface parking  as well as food and beverage outlets and an entertainment lounge 
hollywood casino toledo is anticipated to open by the end of may in june  we reached an agreement in principle with the state of ohio that will provide greater clarity regarding our total state tax burden and future competition  and establishes the framework  including licensing fees  tax structure and minimal capital expenditures  for the placement of video lottery terminals at the state s seven racetracks 
the state of ohio has approved the placement of video lottery terminals at the state s seven racetracks and while we await the regulatory structure to be put in place  we are actively seeking the potential relocation of our existing racetracks at raceway park and beulah park to youngstown and dayton  respectively 
on october   the ohio roundtable filed a complaint in the court of common pleas in franklin county  ohio against a number of defendants  including the governor  the ohio lottery commission and the ohio casino control commission 
the complaint alleges a variety of substantive and procedural defects relative to the approval and implementation of video lottery terminals as well as several counts dealing with the taxation of standalone casinos 
on july   the tenth licensed casino in illinois opened in the city of des plaines 
this facility is a new source of competition for hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet and has had a negative impact on these properties financial results 
however  the surcharge hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet paid to subsidize local horse racing interests is no longer required with the opening of the des plaines facility 
in february  kansas entertainment received the final approval under the kansas expanded lottery act  along with its gaming license from the kansas racing and gaming commission  to proceed with the development of an approximately million hollywood themed destination facility overlooking turn at kansas speedway 
kansas entertainment began construction of the facility in the second quarter of and the facility opened on february  the approximately million facility  inclusive of licensing fees  features a  square foot casino with approximately  slot machines  table games and poker tables  a  space parking structure  as well as a variety of dining and entertainment amenities 
we  along with our partner in kansas entertainment  international speedway  shared equally in the cost of developing and constructing the facility 
we estimate that our share of the project will be approximately million 

table of contents each gaming license in iowa is issued jointly to a gaming operator and a local charitable sponsor 
the agreement between our gaming operator subsidiary in iowa  belle of sioux city  lp the belle and its charitable sponsor  missouri river historical development  inc mrhd  may expire as early as july the belle is in the process of negotiating with mrhd to transition its current barge based facility to a new land based facility and to enter into a new long term agreement with mrhd 
if a new agreement cannot be reached  mrhd has indicated that it may issue a request for proposals for alternative operators for a new land based facility and has preemptively filed a lawsuit seeking to establish its right to do so 
if mrhd were to issue such a request  the belle may contest mrhd s right to do so  may participate in the process and or may seek an alternative charitable sponsor 
accordingly  at this time  there can be no assurance that the belle will be able to reach an agreement with mrhd or  absent such agreement  that it will be able to partner with an alternative charitable sponsor 
in the event that both mrhd and the belle find alternative partners  it is unclear whether the iowa gaming and racing commission would issue a gaming license to one or both such groups 
further  the belle s ability to continue its operations may also be impacted by its ability to renew or extend its existing docking lease  which expires in january  or to locate a suitable site to construct a land based facility 
we closed the transaction to enter into a joint venture that owns and operates the sam houston race park in houston  texas and the valley race park in harlingen  texas  and holds a license for a planned racetrack in laredo  texas on april   following final approval by the texas racing commission and the satisfaction of certain closing conditions 
we intend to work collaboratively with maxxam  our joint venture partner  to strengthen and enhance the existing racetrack operations as well as pursue other opportunities  including the potential for gaming operations at the pari mutuel facilities  to maximize the overall value of the business 
hollywood casino joliet  which was undergoing a million renovation  was closed following a fire that started in the land based pavilion at the facility on march  all customers and employees were successfully evacuated  and the fire was contained on the land side of the property before it could spread to the adjacent casino barge 
on june   the casino barge was reopened with temporary land based facilities  and we began construction of a new land based pavilion 
in december  the first phase of the new permanent land based pavilion was opened to the public and in january the final phase  including a sports bar  was completed 
at the time of the fire  we carried a builders risk insurance policy for the on going renovations with a policy limit of million  inclusive of million for delay in completion and million for property damage 
the builders risk insurance policy included a  property damage deductible and a day delay in completion deductible for the peril of fire 
in addition  we carried comprehensive business interruption and property damage insurance for the operational components of hollywood casino joliet with an overall limit of million 
the operational insurance policy included a million property damage deductible and a hour business interruption deductible for the peril of fire 
we received million in insurance proceeds related to the fire at hollywood casino joliet  with million received during the year ended december  as the insurance recovery amount exceeded the net book value of assets believed to be damaged  destroyed or abandoned and other costs incurred as a result of the fire at hollywood casino joliet in  we recorded a pre tax gain of million during the year ended december  during the second quarter of  the insurance claim for the fire at hollywood casino joliet was settled and no further proceeds will be received 
on may   hollywood casino tunica was forced to close as a result of flooding by the mississippi river 
due to the flooding  access to the property was temporarily cut off and the property sustained minor damage 
the property reopened on may  at the time of the flood  we carried property insurance coverage with a flood limit of million for both 
table of contents property damage and business interruption applicable to this event 
this coverage included a million property damage and two day business interruption deductible for the peril of flood 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax loss for the insurance deductibles for property damage and business interruption 
the million insurance receivable within the consolidated balance sheet at december  was limited to the net book value of assets believed to be damaged and other costs incurred as a result of the flood at hollywood casino tunica that are expected to be recovered via an insurance claim that we expect to finalize in during the year ended december   we received million in insurance proceeds related to the flood at hollywood casino tunica 
in july  we entered into a new interim agreement with the olgc for the operation of the casino rama facility through march   which was subsequently extended in january for an additional six months through september  the olgc is currently in the process of evaluating bids on a new five year operating contract for the facility with bids required to include operating fees that do not exceed million per year 
critical accounting estimates we make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change 
we have identified the accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and litigation  claims and assessments as critical accounting estimates  as they are the most important to our financial statement presentation and require difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates  and the related disclosures  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of  million within our consolidated balance sheet  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had  million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets within our consolidated balance sheet  representing and of total assets  respectively  resulting from our acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses and racing permits 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions  projections for future operations  and data obtained from third party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate 
goodwill is tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value in step of the impairment test  then step of the impairment test is performed to determine the implied value of goodwill for that reporting unit 
if the implied value of goodwill is less than the goodwill allocated for that reporting unit  an impairment loss is recognized 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the company considers its gaming licenses  racing permits and the majority of its trademark intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities indefinitely as well as our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state gaming and racing commissions 
rather  these intangible assets are tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amounts of the indefinite life intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
we use a market approach model  which includes the use of forecasted adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  charges for stock compensation  depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on disposal of assets  and certain other income and expenses  and inclusive of loss from unconsolidated affiliates and adjusted ebitda multiples  as we believe that adjusted ebitda is a widely used measure of performance in the gaming industry and as we use adjusted ebitda as the primary measurement of the operating performance of our properties including the evaluation of operating personnel 
in addition  we believe that an adjusted ebitda multiple is the principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies 
changes in the estimated adjusted ebitda multiples or forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
forecasted adjusted ebitda levels based on our annual operating plan as determined in the fourth quarter can be significantly impacted by the local economy in which our reporting units operate 
for example  increases in unemployment rates can result in decreased customer visitations and or lower customer spend per visit 
in addition  the impact of new legislation which approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions or further expands gaming in jurisdictions where our reporting units currently operate can result in opportunities for us to expand its operations 
however  it also has the impact of increasing competition for our established properties which generally will have a negative effect on those locations profitability once competitors become established as a certain level of cannibalization occurs absent an overall increase in customer visitations 
lastly  increases in gaming taxes approved by state regulatory bodies can negatively impact forecasted adjusted ebitda 
the adjusted ebitda multiple utilized by us in our goodwill impairment valuation methodology is determined based on our current enterprise value  increased for a control premium 
the control 
table of contents premium assumption is based on acquisitions of precedent transactions of comparable businesses 
in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach  management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units  including recent operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and other market data 
these considerations can lead the company to modify its individual reporting units adjusted ebitda multiple 
ebitda multiples can be significantly impacted by various factors  such as a company s present and future cost of capital  the future growth opportunities for the industry as well as for the company itself  general market sentiment  investors perceptions of senior management s effectiveness at deploying capital and managing overall operations  as well as pending or recently completed merger transactions 
assumptions and estimates about future adjusted ebitda levels and multiples by individual reporting units are complex and subjective 
they are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors  such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors  such as changes in our business strategy  which may reallocate capital and resources to different or new opportunities which management believes will enhance our overall value but may be to the detriment of an individual reporting unit 
as of the company s most recent impairment analysis test performed on october   we applied an estimated adjusted ebitda multiple ranging between and to the individual reporting unit s forecasted adjusted ebitda 
for  one reporting unit had a fair value in excess of its carrying value by 
all of our other reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets had fair values that were significantly in excess of their carrying value 
however  we do not believe that the margin by which our reporting units fair value exceeds their carrying value is the only predictor of the likelihood of future impairment charges or the potential magnitude of such charges 
this is because the revenue and earning streams in our industry can vary significantly based on various circumstances  which in many cases are outside of the company s control  and as such are extremely difficult to predict and quantify 
we have disclosed several of these circumstances in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
for instance  changes in legislation that approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions which was the primarily reason for our impairment charges recorded in and  further expands gaming in jurisdictions where we currently operate  new state legislation that requires the implementation of smoking bans at our casinos or any other events outside of our control that make the customer experience less desirable can result in sudden  dramatic and in some cases permanent declines in customer visitations 
as such  we believe at this time all of our reporting units are at risk of goodwill impairment charges in future periods regardless of the margin by which the current fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and that such margin cannot and should not be relied upon to predict which properties are most at risk for future impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million and million for hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet  respectively  due to decreased earning projections at our properties in the chicagoland regional market resulting from an anticipated increase in competition from the scheduled opening of a million casino in the second half of in des plaines  illinois  as well as continued challenging market conditions in the chicagoland regional market 
during the year ended december   we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million at hollywood casino lawrenceburg due to the anticipated impact of gaming expansion in ohio 
once an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite life intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized  there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that have a definite life are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract 
we review the carrying value of our 
table of contents intangible assets that have a definite life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite life exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the company s remaining goodwill and other intangible assets by reporting unit at december  is shown below in thousands reporting unit remaining goodwill and other intangible assets at december  hollywood casino lawrenceburg hollywood casino joliet hollywood casino aurora argosy casino riverside zia park casino argosy casino alton argosy casino sioux city hollywood casino baton rouge others total income taxes at december   we had a net deferred tax liability balance of million within our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
asc also creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  which is included in noncurrent tax liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents results of operations the following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance the fact that most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets 
as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties  jurisdictional expansions such as the september opening of hollywood casino perryville in maryland  the february opening of a casino through a joint venture in kansas  and the anticipated openings in ohio  expansions of gaming in existing jurisdictions such as the introduction of table games in july at hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino at penn national race course and expansions improvements of existing properties 
the actions of government bodies can affect our operations in a variety of ways 
for instance  the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in addition  government bodies may restrict  prevent or negatively impact operations in the jurisdictions in which we do business such as the implementation of smoking bans 
the fact that a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance  in kansas where we opened a casino through a joint venture in february  in ohio where we have plans to open two casinos  one in toledo by the end of may and the other in columbus on november   and in maryland where we opened hollywood casino perryville on september   the first casino in the state and increased competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as the introduction of commercial casinos in kansas  maryland  ohio  and potentially kentucky  an additional casino in illinois which opened on july   gaming expansion in baton rouge  louisiana  and the introduction of tavern licenses in several states 
the continued demand for  and our emphasis on  slot wagering entertainment at our properties 
the successful execution of the development and construction activities currently underway at a number of our facilities  as well as the risks associated with the costs  regulatory approval and the timing for these activities 
the risks related to economic conditions and the effect of such conditions on consumer spending for leisure and gaming activities  which may negatively impact our operating results and our ability to access financing

we have no certain mechanism for determining why consumers choose to spend more or less money at our properties from period to period and as such cannot quantify a dollar amount for each factor that impacts our customers spending behaviors 
however  based on our experience  we can generally offer some insight into the factors that we believe were likely to account for such changes 
in instances where we believe one factor may have had a significantly greater impact than the other factors  we have noted that as well 
however  in all instances  such insights are based only on our reasonable judgment and professional experience  and no assurance can be given as to the accuracy of our judgments 
gaming revenue compared with gaming revenue increased by million  or  to  million in  primarily due to the variances explained below 
gaming revenue for our east west segment increased by million in  primarily due to the opening of hollywood casino perryville on september  and the acquisition of the m resort on june  in addition  gaming revenue also increased for our east west segment due to the introduction of table games in july at hollywood casino at charles town and hollywood casino at penn national race course partially offset by a reduction in slot machine revenue due to lower levels of electronic table game revenues and general economic conditions

our midwest segment also experienced increased gaming revenue at hollywood casino lawrenceburg primarily due to the continued impact of the opening of its new casino riverboat in late june  which enabled this property to gain an increased share of its local gaming market 
these were partially offset by decreased gaming revenue at hollywood casino aurora primarily due to then current economic conditions

under the updated guidance  an entity now has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if the assessment of qualitative factors leads to a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then the entity is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it against its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment
