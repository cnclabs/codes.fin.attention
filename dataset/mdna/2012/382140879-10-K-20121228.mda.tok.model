item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below for further details of the transactions described above 
concept and business strategy we operate with two different formats that have evolved over the course of our history a smaller  to square foot building without indoor seating that is focused on drive thru service and limited walk up service  and a  square foot  seat dining room format that has been the model for the last thirteen restaurants developed in colorado 
we have further refined the prototype design to reduce development costs and improve the return on investment model for future company owned and franchised restaurant expansion with a  to  square foot  seat dining room design that will carry forward all of the core design elements of our prior prototype design 
we operate at the upper end of the quick service restaurant qsr category in terms of the quality of our ingredients and pricing strategy  without a menu or deep discounting 
consumer research has shown us that the customer feels a strong connection to good times and feels better about choosing good times over the larger hamburger qsr brands due to the quality of our ingredients and brand personality 
as a result we have developed a communications umbrella called happiness made to order with three primary brand pillars of innovation  quality and connectedness 
all of our product initiatives are designed to support a brand position that adds differentiation to our concept within the landscape of quick service restaurant competitors  particularly in the hamburger segment 
within innovation we strive to create products and flavor profiles available only at good times that challenge qsr norms 
within quality  our products are supported by fresh  all natural  handcrafted attributes using high quality  regional ingredients 
within connectedness  we strive to create connections with our customers based on the colorado lifestyle  local brand partners and community support and involvement 
with the introduction of all natural  hand breaded chicken tenders in fiscal good times will be the only quick service restaurant chain in the region serving all natural beef and chicken with no hormones  no steroids  no antibiotics and humanely raised animals with no animal byproducts in the feed 
we continued to make significant product introductions and modifications in fiscal with a combination of limited time offer and permanent product introductions including a lifestyle menu providing lower calorie offerings  sweet potato fries  summer and holiday shakes  hatch valley new mexico green chile burritos  fresh grilled  honey cured bacon burgers and loaded fries 
during  we plan to focus on our new chicken platform  the new breakfast daypart  and continued improvements in our core menu  including packaging changes 
while our primary value proposition for the consumer is derived from the quality of ingredients and taste of our products  the current competitive and consumer spending environment continues to redefine value expectations within the quick service restaurant segment and a larger number of transactions are being driven by the availability of menu items at lower price points 
our lower priced options are consistent with our brand strategy to offer fresh  real  handcrafted food with unique flavor profiles in our core menu categories of burgers  chicken  fries  frozen custard and fountain products and we continue to evolve our overall menu price ranges available for our customers  including a lower tier option  a mid tier everyday option and a premium tier for specialty products 
we will continue to focus on elevating the attributes of our menu items that we believe give us a unique position in hamburger quick service restaurants fresh all natural angus beef and all natural chicken that is free from hormones  antibiotics and animal byproducts in the feed  fresh frozen custard made fresh every few hours in every restaurant  fresh grilled honey cured bacon  fresh squeezed lemonade  fresh cut fries  breast of chicken  freshly sliced produce and toppings such as real guacamole and saut ed mushrooms 
we continue to work on the preparation system and packaging design for our burgers with the goal of achieving a more hot off the grill  cooked to order flavor that is more common in fast casual and casual theme concepts than in quick service restaurants 
our core strategies have not changed and we continue to focus on the following initiatives to maintain positive sales growth and improve our profitability focus on our most important drivers of success o values 
we strive to build and develop behaviors and expectations around what we value most throughout the company integrity  continued improvement  customer loyalty and respect for each other 
o people 
we seek to hire high quality people throughout and provide them with comprehensive training programs to ensure that we deliver consistently superior products and service 
we offer an incentive program at the restaurant level based on customer service  personal development and financial performance 
o distinctive quality 
we strive to offer unique  highly distinctive tastes with fresh  high quality  handcrafted ingredients that are all natural and free of hormones  antibiotics or steroids whenever possible 
o excellent systems 
we strive to provide the best systems and processes in every area to free our management to focus on leading their people 
offer high quality  unique menu items that provide exceptional value 
our restaurants feature menu items that are unique in the quick service segment  and flavor profiles that are associated more with fast casual and casual theme restaurants than with fast food 
each menu category has signature recipes with fun  irreverent names that build good times non traditional personality such as wild fries with wild dippin sauce  big daddy bacon cheeseburger  mighty deluxe  burnin buffalo chicken and strawberry cheesecake addiction spoonbender 
we continue to make relevant changes to our entire menu to leverage our heritage of quality products and to position the good times brand for a more unique and highly differentiated consumer experience 
establish a unique brand position in quick service restaurants 
we aspire to have good times stand for innovative  handcrafted  fresh  all natural food 
key brand support for that includes attributes such as fresh  all natural  fresh grilled  authentic  handcrafted  and fresh squeezed with a theme of fresh ingredients and made to order food 
continually improve our fast  friendly  personal customer service under our tagline of happiness made to order 
we strive to optimize and personalize the interaction between our employees and customers  particularly at the points of order and payment  to build a reputation as having the friendliest service 
we manage the face to face interaction with our customers through extensive employee screening and hospitality training to ensure their experience is punctuated by attentive  friendly service 
we have implemented an online screening and hiring system to reduce our hourly employee turnover and hire team members that exhibit good service attitudes 
additionally  we introduced video training tools that we believe enhance consistent execution of our quality standards 
speed of service through our drive thru lanes is important to the consumers need for convenience  but is always secondary to delivering the highest quality product possible 
we monitor each car s service time and have developed incentive programs for management and employees to maintain our quick service standards 
build customer loyalty through a unique brand experience 
in addition to fast friendly service and great tasting products  we strive to maintain clean  safe and appealing facilities with a particular emphasis on well groomed landscaping  freshly painted exteriors and merchandising that highlights the unique product attributes and flavors of our products 
we believe that everything the customer sees  smells  hears and feels influences their overall impression and the reputation of good times and that good times target customer is seeking more out of a quick service restaurant experience 
build awareness of the good times burgers frozen custard brand 
we believe that good times has built substantial brand equity among our customers and has become known for our quality  service and signature tastes  particularly within the hamburger category 
we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to build that reputation within the hamburger category by continuing to build a stronger overall value proposition and offer our new breakfast category outside of burgers  sides and custard 
depending on the availability of capital to us to build out the colorado market  we plan to sustain our media advertising and increase our store level communications  augmented by a new loyalty program and social media 
continually improve our employees knowledge and proficiency of our core processes 
our customers experience is driven by the ability of our management and employees to consistently execute clearly defined processes in every area of our business 
we believe that our employees abilities and attitudes are directly related to our ability to provide well designed service  production and operating processes and effective training that allows them to continually learn  improve and succeed 
we train  test  certify and re train all employees and management on all of our core operating and management processes to continually improve levels of proficiency 
current fiscal year initiatives consistently grow same store sales we will continue to focus on comparable restaurant sales driven by increases in guest counts and increases in the average guest check 
same store sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal we hope to increase guest counts throughout fiscal through a multi faceted approach to continually improve the good times brand experience for our customers by introducing a new breakfast daypart that we anticipate will generate incremental sales of at least  consisting of hatch valley green chile burritos  daz bog coffee and orange juice 
introducing a new line of all natural  hand breaded chicken tenderloin products making good times the only quick service restaurant company in colorado offering all natural beef and chicken raised without hormones or antibiotics and vegetarian fed animals 
continuing to communicate our core value proposition that is centered on the availability of fresh  high quality  handcrafted products at several different price points across our menu 
shifting our marketing communications from solely broadcast media to more store level communications and implementation of new social media initiatives that leverage our existing customer base 
introducing both permanent and limited time products that are only available at good times 
improving our execution on customer service and the delivery of our brand experience through continual re training of all of our employees on our standards and heightened expectations 
continuing to reinvest in our existing facilities with reimaging and remodeling 
reduce our cost of sales in fiscal our food and packaging costs decreased by of restaurant sales from fiscal and in the fourth quarter they were lower than the same period in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to menu reengineering within our current menu categories 
our weighted average commodity costs remained flat in fiscal compared to the prior year 
we implemented a cumulative total menu price increase of during fiscal and in fiscal we expect to make modest price increases in fiscal but anticipate larger menu reengineering within our current menu categories and the addition of a new menu category that will reduce our overall cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
improve our income from operations by managing the profitability of incremental sales growth in addition to reducing our cost of sales  the highest near term return on our capital investment and opportunity for profit improvement is from increasing sales in our existing restaurants 
historically  depending on the sales volume of each restaurant  we have experienced a to profit contribution on incremental sales 
by managing the profitability of compounding sales increases  we believe we can improve our income from operations through the operating leverage on existing assets 
pursue strategic alternatives we continue to pursue possible additional strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value and leverage our existing general administrative expenses and the costs related to our operation as a publicly traded entity 
the strategic alternatives may include acquiring development rights to an additional concept for growth  the acquisition of another operating company  a recapitalization of the company for accelerated growth or some combination of these strategies 
if we can effect one or more of these strategic alternatives  we believe we have the infrastructure in place to support a larger operating company and the growth of another concept 
expansion strategy and site selection we believe that our highest return opportunity is to focus good times growth in colorado for operating and marketing efficiencies off of our existing base of restaurants 
any new development would involve our new prototype restaurant design on sites that are on or adjacent to big box or grocery store anchored shopping centers in high activity and employment areas 
our site selection for new restaurants is oriented toward slightly higher income demographic areas than many of our urban locations and most of our targeted trade areas are in relatively high growth areas of the denver and northern colorado markets 
we lease most of our sites 
when we do purchase and develop a site  we intend to sell the developed site into the sale leaseback market under a long term lease 
our primary site objective is to secure a suitable site  with the decision to buy or lease as a secondary objective 
our site criteria includes a mix of substantial daily traffic  density of at least  people within a three mile radius  strong daytime population and employment base  retail and entertainment traffic generators  good visibility and easy access 
restaurant locations we currently operate or franchise a total of thirty nine good times restaurants  of which thirty six are in colorado  with thirty five in the greater denver metropolitan area and one in silverthorne 
three of these restaurants are dual brand  operated pursuant to a dual brand test agreement with taco john s international  of which there is one in north dakota and two in wyoming 
total denver  co greater metro colorado  other wyoming north dakota company owned co developed franchised dual brand franchised december company owned restaurants co developed franchise operated restaurants total restaurants in december a franchisee s franchise agreement expired for a restaurant operating in boise  idaho and the franchisee closed the restaurant 
also in december we sold one company owned restaurant in littleton  colorado for cash 
in april a franchisee closed a restaurant in colorado springs  colorado as part of our exit from that market 
in july we sold one company owned restaurant in loveland  colorado 
in august we purchased a restaurant in loveland  colorado from the franchisee 
in december a franchisee terminated its good times franchise agreement in the dual brand concept and has stopped selling good times products at two colorado locations 
we anticipate that franchisees may close one low volume franchised restaurants in fiscal and we may close one lower volume company operated restaurants  which would result in improved overall operating margins and more efficient allocation of overhead resources 
menu the menu of a good times burgers frozen custard restaurant is limited to hamburgers  cheeseburgers  chicken sandwiches  french fries  onion rings  fresh squeezed and frozen lemonades  soft drinks and frozen custard products 
in november we introduced hatch valley green chile breakfast burritos  orange juice and coffee 
each menu item is made to order at the time the customer places the order and is not pre prepared 
the hamburger patty is made with meyer all natural  all angus beef  served on a bun 
hamburgers and cheeseburgers are garnished with fresh iceberg lettuce  fresh sliced sweet red onions  mayonnaise  guacamole  fresh grilled honey cured bacon  and proprietary sauces 
the chicken products include a spiced  battered whole muscle breast patty and a grilled seasoned breast patty  both served with mayonnaise  lettuce and tomatoes  and chicken dunkers  whole breast meat breaded tenders 
signature chicken products include the burnin buffalo  guacamole bacon chicken  and whole muscle breast meat dunkers 
equipment has been automated and equipped with compensating computers to deliver a consistent product and minimize variability in operating systems 
all natural angus beef is raised without the use of any hormones  antibiotics or animal byproducts that are normally used in the open beef market 
we believe that all natural beef delivers a better tasting product and  because of the rigorous protocols and testing that are a part of the meyer all natural beef processes  may also minimize the risk of any food borne bacteria related illnesses 
fresh frozen custard is a premium ice cream requiring in excess of butterfat content and 
egg yolks with a proprietary vanilla blend that is prepared from highly specialized equipment that minimizes the amount of air that is added to the mix and that creates smaller ice crystals than other frozen dairy desserts 
the custard is scooped similarly to hard packed ice cream but is served at a slightly warmer temperature 
the resulting product is smoother  creamier and thicker than typical soft serve or hard packed ice cream products 
good times serves the frozen custard as vanilla and a flavor of the day in cups and cones  specialty sundaes and spoonbenders  a mix of custard and toppings  and we anticipate it will continue to be a significant percentage of sales as we continue to develop and promote custard products 
the breakfast menu is centered around hatch valley green chile burritos made with our own proprietary green chile recipe using hatch valley new mexico roasted green chiles  eggs  potatoes  and cheese offered with the choice of bacon  sausage or chorizo 
we also offer a premium coffee made by daz bog  a colorado based coffee roaster  and pure orange juice 
marketing advertising our marketing strategy focuses on driving comparable restaurant sales through attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers  communicating specific product news and attributes to build strong points of difference from competitors  and communicating a unique  strong and consistent brand personality 
media is an important component of building good times brand awareness and distinctiveness 
we spent most of our broadcast advertising dollars on radio media during fiscal the colorado market is an expensive media market  so most of our advertising placement is not in prime time but in early and late fringe  prime access and late news time slots 
as we continue to develop more and more distinctiveness to good times brand and increase penetration of the colorado market  we anticipate we will continue to use media advertising to increase overall awareness 
however  during fiscal  we reduced our overall advertising expenditures and focused more of our marketing funds on store level and trade area level communication and activities  supplemented by social media 
during fiscal we will continue with limited broadcast media  a social media presence that affords us a higher level of engagement with current customers and an increased level of product giveaways to support high sales opportunity products 
another important component of our marketing efforts is point of sale and on site merchandising 
we rotate new four color product point of purchase displays every other month and support new product introductions with extensive merchandising 
our restaurants with dining rooms have back lit and front lit product displays and product messaging throughout 
menu boards are kept fresh with new food photography and graphics several times throughout the year 
we plan to continue to be active in digital media in order to create more customer engagement with the good times brand 
we anticipate leveraging our customer email database and website to create cost effective channels to target existing customers and increase their frequency 
operations restaurant management we have developed a limited number of operating partners in a few of our restaurants as we are able to recruit qualified candidates 
we believe that this is a distinct competitive advantage that provides a higher level of service  quality control and stability over time 
the objective of the operating partner program is to have each partner develop a relationship with the employees  the customers and the community at their restaurant and develop an ownership mentality with commensurate rewards as sales increase over a longer period of time 
the program allows an operating partner to earn of a restaurant s improvement in cash flow over an established baseline 
each good times restaurant employs an operating partner or a general manager  one to two assistant managers and approximately to employees  most of whom work part time during three shifts 
an eight to ten week training program is utilized to train restaurant managers on all phases of the operation 
ongoing training is provided as necessary 
we believe that incentive compensation of our restaurant managers is essential to the success of our business 
accordingly  in addition to a salary  managerial employees may be paid a bonus based upon proficiency in meeting financial  customer service and quality performance objectives tied to a monthly scorecard of measures 
most of our managers participate in a more traditional bonus plan based on their performance against their monthly financial  operating  customer and people development scorecard metrics 
operational systems and processes we believe that we have high level operating systems and processes relative to those in the industry 
detailed processes have been developed for hourly  daily  weekly and monthly responsibilities that drive consistency across our system of restaurants and performance against our standards within different day parts 
we utilize a labor program to determine optimal staffing needs of each restaurant based on its actual customer flow and demand 
we also employ several additional operational tools to continuously monitor and improve speed of service  food waste  food quality  sanitation  financial management and employee development 
we are testing a new point of sale computer system that will improve our ability to analyze transaction  sales mix and employee data that we believe can decrease our food waste and improve the effectiveness of store level marketing initiatives 
the order system at each good times restaurant is equipped with an internal timing device that displays and records the time each order takes to prepare and deliver 
the total transaction time for the delivery of food at the window is approximately to seconds during peak times 
we use several sources of customer feedback to evaluate each restaurant s service and quality performance  including an extensive secret shopper program  customer comment phone line  telephone surveys and website comments 
additionally  management uses both its own primary consumer research for product development and to determine customer usage and attitude patterns as well as third party market research that evaluates good times performance ratings on several different operating attributes against key competitors 
training we strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the careful training and supervision of all our employees at all levels and the establishment of  and adherence to  high standards relating to personnel performance  food and beverage preparation and maintenance of our restaurants 
each manager must complete an eight to ten week training program  be certified on several core processes and is then closely supervised to show both comprehension and capability before they are allowed to manage autonomously 
all of our training and development is based upon a train  test  certify  re train cycle around standards and operating processes at all levels 
we conduct a semi annual performance review with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals 
we have a defined weekly and monthly goal setting process around future performance goals 
we have a defined weekly and monthly goal setting process around service  employee development  financial management and store maintenance goals for every restaurant 
additionally we have a library of video training tools to drive training efficiencies and consistency 
recruiting and retention we seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and operating partners 
we support employees by offering competitive wages and benefits  including a k plan  medical insurance  and incentive plans at every level that are tied to performance against key goals and objectives 
we motivate and prepare our employees by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement 
we also provide various other incentives  including vacations  car allowances  monthly performance bonuses and monetary rewards for managers who develop future managers for our restaurants 
we have implemented an online screening and hiring tool that has proven to reduce hourly employee turnover by more than 
franchising good times has prepared prototype area rights and franchise agreements  a uniform franchise disclosure document ufdd and advertising material to be utilized in soliciting prospective franchisees 
we seek to attract franchisees that are experienced restaurant operators  well capitalized and have demonstrated the ability to develop one to five restaurants 
we review sites selected for franchises and monitor performance of franchise units 
we are not currently soliciting new franchisees and will not do so until capital becomes more available and we have regained greater same store sales momentum 
we estimate that it will cost a franchisee on average approximately  to  to open a restaurant with dining room seating  including pre opening costs and working capital  assuming the land is leased 
a franchisee typically will pay a royalty of of net sales  an advertising materials fee of at least of net sales  plus participation in regional advertising up to an additional of net sales  or a higher amount approved by the advertising cooperative  and initial development and franchise fees totaling  per restaurant 
among the services and materials which we provide to franchisees are site selection assistance  plans and specifications for construction of the good times burgers and frozen custard restaurants  an operating manual which includes product specifications and quality control procedures  training  on site opening supervision and advice from time to time relating to operation of the franchised restaurants 
after a franchise agreement is signed  we actively work with and monitor our franchisees to ensure successful franchise operations as well as compliance with good times systems and procedures 
during the development phase  we assist in the selection of sites and the development of prototype and building plans  including all required changes by local municipalities and developers 
we provide an opening team of trainers to assist in the opening of the restaurant and training of the employees 
we advise the franchisee on menu  management training  marketing  and employee development 
on an ongoing basis we conduct standards reviews of all franchise restaurants in key areas including product quality  service standards  restaurant cleanliness and sanitation  food safety and people development 
we have entered into twelve franchise agreements in the greater denver metropolitan area 
twelve franchise restaurants and seven joint venture restaurants are operating in the denver metropolitan area media market 
dual branded franchised restaurants operate in gillette and sheridan  wyoming  and bismarck  north dakota 
management information systems financial and management control is maintained through the use of automated data processing and centralized accounting and management information systems that we provide 
sales  labor and cash data is collected daily via a restaurant back office system which gathers data from the restaurant point of sale system 
management receives daily  weekly and monthly reports identifying food  labor and operating expenses and other significant indicators of restaurant performance 
we believe that these reporting systems are sophisticated and enhance our ability to control and manage operations 
food preparation  quality control purchasing we believe that we have excellent food quality standards relative to the quick service restaurant industry 
our systems are designed to protect our food supply throughout the preparation process 
we inspect specific qualified manufacturers and work together with those manufacturers to provide specifications and quality controls 
our operations management teams are trained in a comprehensive safety and sanitation course provided by the national restaurant association 
minimum cook temperature requirements and line checks throughout the day ensure the safety and quality of both burgers and other items we use in our restaurants 
we currently purchase of our restaurant food and paper supplies from food services of america formerly yancey s food service 
we do not believe that the current reliance on this sole vendor will have any long term material adverse effect since we believe that there are a sufficient number of other suppliers from which food and paper supplies could be purchased 
we do not anticipate any difficulty in continuing to obtain an adequate quantity of food and paper supplies of acceptable quality and at acceptable prices 
employees at december   we had approximately employees of which are part time hourly employees and are salaried employees working full time 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
competition the restaurant industry  including the fast food segment  is highly competitive 
good times competes with a large number of other hamburger oriented fast food restaurants in the areas in which it operates 
many of these restaurants are owned and operated by regional and national restaurant chains  many of which have greater financial resources and experience than we do 
restaurant companies that currently compete with good times in the denver market include mcdonald s  burger king  wendy s  carl s jr  sonic and jack in the box 
double drive through restaurant chains such as rally s hamburgers and checker s drive in restaurants  which currently operate a total of over double drive through restaurants in various markets in the united states  are not currently operating in colorado 
culver s and freddy s are the only significant competitors offering frozen custard as a primary menu item operating in the denver and colorado springs markets and both have a significant presence in midwestern markets that may be targeted for expansion 
additional fast casual hamburger restaurants are being developed in the colorado market  such as smashburger and five guys  however  they do not have drive through service and generate an average per person check that is approximately higher than good times average check 
we believe that we may have a competitive advantage in terms of quality of product compared to traditional fast food hamburger chains 
early development of our double drive through concept in colorado has given us an advantage over other double drive through chains that may seek to expand into colorado because of our brand awareness and present restaurant locations 
nevertheless  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition and marketing capability 
furthermore  most of our competitors in the fast food business operate more restaurants  have been established longer  and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
there is also active competition for management personnel  as well as for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
trademarks good times has registered its mark good times drive thru burgers sm with the state of colorado 
we have also registered our mark good times burgers frozen custard federally and with the state of colorado 
good times received approval of its federal registration of good times in in addition we own trademarks or service marks that have been registered  or for which applications are pending  with the united states patent and trademark office including but not limited to lifestyle menu  big daddy bacon cheeseburger  chicken dunkers  happiness made to order  mighty deluxe  mile high sliders  pawbender  spoonbender  wild fries  and wild dippin sauce 
our trademarks expire between and government regulation each good times restaurant is subject to the regulations of various health  sanitation  safety and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located 
difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new good times restaurant 
federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations 
more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime  and other working conditions 
in addition  we are subject to the americans with disabilities act  which requires restaurants and other facilities open to the public to provide for access and use of facilities by the handicapped

item a 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to the company s securities 
you are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive 
we have accumulated losses 
we have incurred losses in every fiscal year since inception except   and as of september  we had an accumulated deficit of  we cannot assure you that we will not have a loss for the current fiscal year ending september  we must sustain same store sales increases 
we must sustain same store sales increases in existing restaurants to sustain profitability and we experienced declines in our same store sales in fiscal  fiscal and the first ten months of fiscal sales increases will depend in part on the success of our advertising and promotion of new and existing menu items and consumer acceptance 
we cannot assure that our advertising and promotional efforts will in fact be successful 
new restaurants  when and if opened  may not be profitable  if at all  for several months 
we anticipate that our new restaurants  when and if opened  will generally take several months to reach normalized operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants  including lack of market awareness  the need to hire and train a sufficient number of employees  operating costs  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter  pre opening costs and other factors 
in addition  restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing markets  and may have higher restaurant level operating expense ratios than in existing markets 
sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average annual company owned restaurant sales  if at all  thereby affecting the profitability of these restaurants 
our operations are susceptible to the cost of and changes in food availability which could adversely affect our operating results 
our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  governmental regulation  production  availability  recalls of food products and seasonality may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply chain 
we enter into annual contracts with our chicken and other miscellaneous suppliers 
our contracts for chicken are fixed price contracts 
our contracts for beef are generally based on current market prices plus a processing fee 
changes in the price or availability of chicken or beef or other commodities could materially adversely affect our profitability 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  because we provide a value priced product  we may not be able to pass along price increases to our guests 
the macroeconomic recession could affect our operating results 
the current state of the economy and decreased consumer spending may adversely affect our sales in the future 
a proliferation of heavy discounting by our major competitors may also negatively affect our sales and operating results 
price increases may impact guest visits 
we may make price increases on selected menu items in order to offset increased operating expenses we believe will be recurring 
although we have not experienced significant consumer resistance to our past price increases  we cannot provide assurance that this or other future price increases will not deter guests from visiting our restaurants or affect their purchasing decisions 
the hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive 
the hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive 
our competitors include many recognized national and regional fast food hamburger restaurant chains such as mcdonald s  burger king  wendy s  carl s jr  sonic  jack in the box and culver s 
we also compete with small regional and local hamburger and other fast food restaurants  many of which feature drive through service 
most of our competitors have greater financial resources  marketing programs and name recognition 
all of the major hamburger chains have offered selected food items and combination meals at discounted prices 
discounting by competitors may adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our restaurants 
sites may be difficult to acquire 
location of our restaurants in high traffic and readily accessible areas is an important factor for our success 
drive through restaurants require sites with specific characteristics and there are a limited number of suitable sites available in our geographic markets 
since suitable locations are in great demand  in the future we may not be able to obtain optimal sites at a reasonable cost 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the sites we do obtain will be successful 
we will require additional financing 
in order to fully develop the denver market and to expand into markets outside of colorado  we will require additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to access sufficient capital to adequately finance our operations and our planned developments or that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms 
the current economic environment and status of the capital markets may adversely affect our ability to acquire additional debt or equity financing for working capital  new restaurant development  or refinancing of existing funding agreements 
if our franchisees cannot develop or finance new restaurants  build them on suitable sites or open them on schedule  our growth and success may be impeded 
under our current form of area development agreement  some franchisees must develop a predetermined number of restaurants according to a schedule that lasts for the term of their development agreement 
franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open the restaurants required by their development schedules  or may be unable to find suitable sites on which to develop them 
franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites  obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules 
from time to time in the past  we have agreed to extend or modify development schedules and we may do so in the future 
any of these problems could slow our growth and reduce our franchise revenues 
additionally  our franchisees depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants 
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing adversely affects the number and rate of new restaurant openings by our franchisees and adversely affects our future franchise revenues 
our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business 
franchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees 
we provide training and support to franchisees  however  franchisees operate their restaurants as independent businesses 
consequently  the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control 
moreover  franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements  or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel 
our image and reputation  and the image and reputation of other franchisees  may suffer materially  and system wide sales could significantly decline  if our franchisees do not operate successfully 
we depend on key management employees 
we believe our current operations and future success depend largely on the continued services of our management employees  in particular boyd e 
hoback  our president and chief executive officer  and scott lefever  our vice president of operations 
although we have entered into an employment agreement with mr 
hoback  he may voluntarily terminate his employment with us at any time 
in addition  we do not maintain key person insurance on messrs 
hoback s or lefever s life 
the loss of messrs 
hoback s or lefever s services  or other key management personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
labor shortages could slow our growth or harm our business 
our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified  high energy employees 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some areas 
the inability to recruit and retain these individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could harm our business 
additionally  competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees  which could result in higher labor costs 
most of our employees are paid on an hourly basis 
the employees are paid in accordance with applicable minimum wage regulations 
accordingly  any increase in the minimum wage  whether state or federal  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevada law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent stockholders from realizing a premium on their investment 
we are subject to anti takeover laws for nevada corporations 
these anti takeover laws prevent a nevada corporation from engaging in a business combination with any stockholder  including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder  who owns or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock  for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired or more of the corporation s voting stock  unless specified conditions are met 
our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain a number of provisions that may deter or impede takeovers or changes of control or management 
these provisions authorize our board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance  do not allow for cumulative voting in the election of directors unless required by applicable law 
under cumulative voting a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors  state that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board the president or any two directors and must be called by the president upon the written request of the holders of ten percent of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at such special meeting  and provide that the authorized number of directors is no more than seven as determined by our board of directors 
these provisions  alone or in combination with each other  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to stockholders for their common stock 
we have a controlling stockholder 
small island investments limited sii beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock and controls approximately of the total voting shares through its ownership of our outstanding series c convertible preferred stock 
sii also has veto rights with respect to certain major corporate transactions by virtue of the terms of its series c convertible preferred stock 
in addition  sii has the right  for so long as it owns more than of our outstanding capital stock  to designate a majority of our board of directors 
sii therefore has the ability to alter the strategic direction and or capital structure of the company 
future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results and affect our reported results of operations 
changes in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or differing interpretations with respect to our current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results 
our nasdaq listing is important 
our common stock is currently listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market 
the nasdaq maintenance rules require  among other things  that our common stock price remains above per share and that we have minimum stockholders equity of million 
during fiscal  we received notice of non compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market 
the closing of our private placement transaction with sii on september  has allowed the company to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement 
in addition  sii has agreed to purchase an additional  shares of series c convertible preferred stock  for an additional aggregate purchase price of  or per share  on or before march   at such time as the company s board of directors reasonably determines  with days prior notice to sii  that the company requires such funds to maintain the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market 
we are subject to extensive government regulation that may adversely hinder or impact our ability to govern various aspects of our business including our ability to expand and develop our restaurants 
the restaurant industry is subject to various federal  state and local government regulations  including those relating to the sale of food 
while in the past we have been able to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental licenses  permits and approvals  our failure to maintain these licenses  permits and approvals  including food licenses  could adversely affect our operating results 
difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants 
local authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our food licenses if they determine that our conduct does not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations 
various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs 
these laws govern minimum wage requirements  such as those to be imposed by recently enacted legislation in colorado  overtime pay  meal and rest breaks  unemployment tax rates  workers compensation rates  citizenship or residency requirements  child labor regulations and sales taxes 
additional government imposed increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits may increase our operating costs 
the federal americans with disabilities act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment 
although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled  we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to  or make reasonable accommodations for  disabled persons 
we are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor licensee relationship 
many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement  including limitations on non competition provisions and the termination or non renewal of a franchise 
some states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in the state 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
keeping abreast of  and in compliance with  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and the nasdaq market rules  has required an increased amount of management attention and expense 
we remain committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment has resulted in and will continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
risks related to internal controls 
public companies in the united states are required to review their internal controls as set forth in the sarbanes oxley act of it should be noted that any system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the system are met 
in addition  the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events 
because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems  there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
if the internal controls put in place by us are not adequate or in conformity with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  we may be forced to restate our financial statements and take other actions which will take significant financial and managerial resources  as well as be subject to fines and other government enforcement actions 
health concerns relating to the consumption of beef  chicken or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations 
like other restaurant chains  consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the avian influenza  also known as bird flu  or the consumption of beef  the key ingredient in many of our menu items  or negative publicity concerning food quality  illness and injury generally  such as negative publicity concerning e 
coli  mad cow or foot and mouth disease  publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us  or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants 
this negative publicity may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants 
if we react to the negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu we may lose guests who do not prefer the new concept or menu  and may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable 
in addition  we may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of a concept change and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors 
a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business

the company analyzes its operations on a regional basis  when evaluating closed restaurant operations for consideration as to the classification between continuing operations and discontinued operations 
prior to fiscal the company evaluated operations at the restaurant level 
in its reevaluation the company determined that as most of the company s restaurants are within the denver metropolitan region and share common advertising  distribution  supervision  and to a certain extent even customers  the company believes it appropriate to perform its analysis on a regional basis 
during the company closed two restaurants and in the company closed an additional two restaurants 
the operations related to these restaurants are reflected as part of continuing operations as they were within one continuing operating region 
the following presents certain historical financial information of the company 
this financial information includes the combined operations of the company and its subsidiary for the fiscal years ended september  to certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
such reclassifications had no effect on the net income or loss

restaurant sales increased  due to one restaurant purchased from a franchisee in august restaurant sales decreased  due to one non traditional company owned restaurant not included in same store sales and decreased  due to one dual branded company owned restaurant sold in july restaurant sales also decreased  due to two company owned restaurants sold in fiscal and one company owned restaurant sold in fiscal net revenues increased  in fiscal due to an increase in franchise royalties and fees 
the positive same store sales results for fiscal reflect the continuation of the positive momentum we experienced in fiscal when same store sales increased 
same store sales were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal by road construction and road closures at two of our restaurants 
the estimated loss of sales related to these two restaurants in the fourth quarter was  factoring out the sales declines at the two affected locations  our same store sales would have increased approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal which would have been the sixth consecutive quarter of same store sales increases 
our outlook for fiscal is cautiously optimistic based on the last two years of positive sales trends  however our sales trends are influenced by many factors and the macroeconomic environment remains challenging for smaller restaurant chains 
our average transaction increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and we are continuing to manage our marketing communications to balance growth in customer traffic and the average customer expenditure 
average restaurant sales for company owned and co developed restaurants including double drive thru restaurants and restaurants with dining rooms but excluding dual brand restaurants and out of market restaurants for fiscal and were as follows fiscal fiscal company operated company operated restaurants sales range from a low of  to a high of  for factors which may affect future results of operations  please refer to the section entitled current fiscal year initiatives in item on pages of this report and a related discussion of planned product and system changes discussed in the section entitled concept and business strategy in item on pages of this report 
restaurant operating costs restaurant operating costs as a percent of restaurant sales were for fiscal compared to in fiscal the changes in restaurant level costs are explained as follows restaurant level costs for the period ended september  decrease in food and packaging costs decrease in payroll and other employee benefit costs decrease in occupancy and other operating costs decrease in depreciation and amortization costs restaurant level costs for the period ended september  food and packaging costs food and packaging costs for fiscal decreased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales 
in fiscal our weighted food and packaging costs increased approximately 
we implemented a menu price increase in february  a menu price increase in late may and a menu price increase in september in fiscal our weighted food and packaging costs decreased slightly 
the total menu price increases taken during fiscal were  all of which were taken in the last five months of the fiscal year 
we anticipate cost pressure on several core commodities  including beef  bacon and dairy for fiscal however  we anticipate our food and packaging costs as a percentage of sales will remain consistent with fiscal in fiscal from a combination of price increases  product sales mix changes and recipe modifications 
payroll and other employee benefit costs for fiscal  payroll and other employee benefit costs decreased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales 
the decrease in payroll and other employee benefit expenses as a percent of restaurant sales for fiscal is primarily the result of higher restaurant sales 
because payroll costs are semi variable in nature they decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales when there is an increase in restaurant sales 
additionally payroll and other employee benefits decreased approximately  in fiscal due to two company owned restaurants sold in february and may  one company owned restaurant sold in december and one company owned restaurant sold in july we anticipate payroll and other employee benefit costs will decrease as a percentage of sales in fiscal due to the operating leverage on increasing sales 
occupancy and other costs for fiscal  occupancy and other costs decreased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales 
the  decrease in occupancy and other costs is primarily attributable to decrease in building rent of  primarily due to the four restaurants sold in fiscal and fiscal decrease of  in all other restaurant operating costs due to the four restaurants sold in fiscal and fiscal the decreases above were offset by the following cost increases increases in various other restaurant operating costs of  at existing restaurants comprised primarily of repairs and maintenance utility costs and bank fees 
an adjustment of  to our liability for the accretion of deferred rent in fiscal due to two sold restaurants 
this compares to an adjustment of  in fiscal due to sold restaurants 
occupancy costs may increase as a percent of sales as new company owned restaurants are developed due to higher rent associated with sale leaseback operating leases  as well as increased property taxes on those locations 
depreciation and amortization costs for fiscal  depreciation and amortization costs decreased  from  in fiscal to  depreciation costs primarily decreased due to the four restaurants sold in fiscal and as well as due to declining depreciation expense in our aging company owned and joint venture restaurants 
general and administrative costs for fiscal  general and administrative costs increased  from  of total revenues in fiscal to  of total revenues 
the  increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily attributable to increase in payroll and employee benefit costs of  due to the reinstatement of certain management level salaries that were reduced in fiscal and increase in professional services of  decrease of  in miscellaneous income 
net increases in various other expenses of  advertising costs for fiscal  advertising costs increased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales 
contributions are made to the advertising materials fund and regional advertising cooperative based on a percentage of sales and there was a slight increase in the percentage contribution for fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate that fiscal advertising expense will remain consistent with fiscal and will consist primarily of radio advertising  social media and on site and point of purchase merchandising totaling approximately of restaurant sales 
franchise costs for fiscal franchise costs decreased  from  
of total revenues in fiscal to  
of total revenues 
the decrease in franchise costs for fiscal is primarily attributable to a lower allocation of costs incurred due to fewer franchise restaurants in the system 
gain on restaurant asset sales for fiscal the gain on restaurant asset sales decreased to  compared to  in fiscal the gain on restaurant assets sales in fiscal is comprised of a  deferred gain on a previous sale lease back transaction  an  gain on the sale of two company owned restaurants  offset by a loss to adjust the book value of a property in firestone  colorado to its fair market value 
the  gain on restaurant asset sales in fiscal was primarily related to the  gain on the sale of two company owned restaurants in february and may and the sale of one co developed building related to a restaurant closed in fiscal loss from operations the loss from operations was  in fiscal compared to a loss from operations of  in fiscal the decrease in loss from operations for the fiscal year is due primarily to matters discussed in the restaurant operating costs  general and administrative costs  franchise costs and loss gain on restaurant assets sections above 
net loss the net loss was  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal the change from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the matters discussed in the net revenues  restaurant operating costs  selling  general and administrative costs and franchise costs sections of item  as well as a decrease in net interest expense of  compared to the same prior year period  and an increase in other expenses of  compared to the same prior year period 
net interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to the same prior year period primarily due to a reduction in the principal balances outstanding on the notes payable to wells fargo bank and pfgi ii 
net interest expense for fiscal includes non cash amortization of debt issuance costs of  related to warrants issued in conjunction with the extension of the pfgi ii loan in january  net interest expense for fiscal includes non cash amortization of debt issuance costs of  related to warrants issued in conjunction with the extension of the pfgi ii loan in january   and beneficial conversion rights and warrants related to the loan agreement with w capital and john t 
macdonald entered into in february see financing below 
income attributable to non controlling interests for fiscal the income attributable to non controlling interests was  compared to  in fiscal the loss from non controlling interest represents the limited partner s share of income in the co developed restaurants 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital as of september   we had a working capital excess of  because restaurant sales are collected in cash and accounts payable for food and paper products are paid two to four weeks later  restaurant companies often operate with working capital deficits 
we anticipate that working capital deficits may be incurred in the future and possibly increase if and when new good times restaurants are opened 
we believe that we will have sufficient capital to meet our working capital  long term debt obligations and recurring capital expenditure needs in fiscal and beyond 
we will require additional capital sources for the development of new restaurants 
additionally  we may sell or sublease select underperforming company operated restaurants if we believe the realizable asset value is greater than the long term cash flow value or if the asset does not fit our longer term distribution and location of restaurants 
financing wells fargo note payable the balance of our loan from wells fargo bank  na wells fargo at september  was  we subsequently used a portion of the proceeds received by the company from the sale of series c convertible preferred stock to sii to pay in full the outstanding balance  along with the associated interest rate swap with wells fargo 
pfgi ii llc promissory note in july  we borrowed  from pfgi ii  llc pfgi ii  an unrelated third party  and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of  to pfgi ii the pfgi ii note 
the pfgi ii note has subsequently been amended on several occasions 
during and  the interest rate on the note was 
in april pfgi ii agreed to extend the loan to december  on the existing note terms if a sale leaseback has not been completed on the firestone property 
the note balance at september  was  on november  we entered into a sale lease back transaction on the firestone property with net proceeds of  and we used  to pay down the pfgi ii note 
the remaining balance of  is due on or before january  which we anticipate repaying from the proceeds of a sale leaseback transaction 
sii investment transactions on december   we closed on a private placement of  shares of our common stock to sii for an aggregate purchase price of  or per share  pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement between the company and sii dated october   as amended december  as a result of the completion of the investment transaction with sii  sii became the beneficial owner of approximately percent of the company s outstanding common stock 
the proceeds from the transaction were used to pay approximately  of expenses related to the transaction  repay  in short term loans  reduce accrued liabilities by  reduce accounts payable by approximately  and the balance going to increase the company s working capital 
on september   we closed on a second investment transaction with sii  in which the company sold and issued to sii  shares of series c convertible preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of  or per share pursuant to the purchase agreement  with each share of series c convertible preferred stock convertible at the option of the holder into two shares of our common stock  subject to certain anti dilution adjustments

cash flows net cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal compared to net cash used in operating activities of  in fiscal the increase in net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal was the result of a net loss of  and non cash reconciling items totaling  comprised principally of depreciation and amortization of  amortization of debt issuance costs of   of stock option compensation expense  a  gain on asset sales  a  increase in other receivables and other assets and net increases in operating assets and liabilities totaling

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal the fiscal activity includes principal payments on notes payable and long term debt of  costs related to the preferred stock sale of  and distributions to non controlling interests in partnerships of  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements we remain contingently liable on various land leases underlying restaurants that were previously sold to franchisees 
we have never experienced any losses related to these contingent lease liabilities  however  if a franchisee defaults on the payments under the leases  we would be liable for the lease payments as the assignor or sublessor of the lease 
currently we have not been notified nor are we aware of any leases in default under which we are contingently liable 
however there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board  commonly referred to as the fasb 
the fasb sets generally accepted accounting principles gaap that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
over the years  the fasb and other designated gaap setting bodies  have issued standards in the form of fasb statements  interpretations  fasb staff positions  eitf consensuses  aicpa statements of position  etc 
the fasb recognized the complexity of its standard setting process and embarked on a revised process in that culminated in the release on july   of the fasb accounting standards codification  sometimes referred to as the codification or asc 
to the company  this means instead of following the statements  interpretations  staff positions  etc  we will follow the guidance in topics as defined in the asc 
the codification does not change how the company accounts for its transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
however  when referring to guidance issued by the fasb  the company refers to topics in the asc rather than statements  etc 
the above change was made effective by the fasb for periods ending on or after september  we have updated references to gaap in this annual report on form k to reflect the guidance in the codification 
notes receivable we evaluate the collectability of our note receivables from franchisees annually 
the aggregate notes receivable on the consolidated balance sheet at september  were  discontinued operations the company analyzes its operations on a regional basis  when evaluating closed restaurant operations for consideration as to the classification between continuing operations and discontinued operations 
prior to the company evaluated operations at the restaurant level 
in its reevaluation the company determined that as most of the company s restaurants are within the denver metropolitan region and share common advertising  distribution  supervision  and to a certain extent even customers  the company believes it appropriate to perform its analysis on a regional basis 
during fiscal the company closed two restaurants  and in fiscal  the company closed an additional two restaurants 
the operations related to these restaurants are reflected as part of continuing operations as they were within one continuing operating region 
non controlling interests non controlling interests  previously called minority interests  are presented as a separate item in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
consolidated net income or loss attributable to non controlling interests are presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions  and that deconsolidation of a subsidiary is recorded as a gain or loss based on the fair value on the deconsolidation date 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  including land  property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the capitalized costs of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and the expected cash flows are based on recent historical cash flows at the restaurant level the lowest level that cash flows can be determined 
an analysis was performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis at september  assumptions used in preparing expected cash flows were as follows sales projections are as follows fiscal sales are projected to increase with respect to fiscal and for fiscal years to we have used annual increases of to 
the increase in fiscal is due to the addition of breakfast sales 
we believe the to increase in the fiscal years beyond is a reasonable expectation of growth and that it would be unreasonable to expect no growth in our sales 
these increases include menu price increases in addition to any real growth 
historically our weighted menu prices have increased to 
our variable and semi variable restaurant operating costs are projected to increase proportionately with the sales increases as well as increasing an additional per year consistent with inflation 
our other fixed restaurant operating costs are projected to increase to per year 
food and packaging costs are projected to decrease approximately 
as a percentage of sales in relation to our fiscal food and packaging costs as a result of menu price increases and other menu initiatives 
salvage value has been estimated on a restaurant by restaurant basis considering each restaurant s particular equipment package and building size 
given the results of our impairment analysis at september  there are no restaurants which are impaired as their projected undiscounted cash flows show recoverability of their asset values 
our impairment analysis included a sensitivity analysis with regard to the cash flow projections that determine the recoverability of each restaurant s assets 
the results indicate that even with a decline in our projected cash flows we would still not have any potential impairment issues 
however if we elect to sublease  close or otherwise exit a restaurant location impairment could be required 
each time we conduct an impairment analysis in the future we will compare actual results to our projections and assumptions  and to the extent our actual results do not meet expectations  we will revise our assumptions and this could result in impairment charges being recognized 
all of the judgments and assumptions made in preparing the cash flow projections are consistent with our other financial statement calculations and disclosures 
the assumptions used in the cash flow projections are consistent with other forward looking information prepared by the company  such as those used for internal budgets  discussions with third parties  and or reporting to management or the board of directors 
projecting the cash flows for the impairment analysis involves significant estimates with regard to the performance of each restaurant  and it is reasonably possible that the estimates of cash flows may change in the near term resulting in the need to write down operating assets to fair value 
if the assets are determined to be impaired  the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value would be determined using forecasted cash flows discounted using an estimated average cost of capital and the impairment charge would be recognized in income from operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company provides a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
the deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are adjusted as necessary 
we believe it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions 
the company continues to remain subject to examination by us federal authorities for the years through the company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded 
the company s practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
the company has accrued for interest and penalties as of september  variable interest entities once an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity vie  the party with the controlling financial interest  the primary beneficiary  is required to consolidate it 
we have two franchisees with notes payable to the company and after analysis we have determined that  while these franchisees are vie s  we are not the primary beneficiary of the entities  and therefore they are not required to be consolidated 
fair value of financial instruments fair value is established under a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and enhances disclosure about fair value measurements 
new accounting pronouncements there are no current pronouncements that affect the company 
subsequent events at september  we classified  as assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
these costs are related to a site in firestone  colorado which has been fully developed 
on november  we completed a sale lease back transaction on the property 
the net sale leaseback proceeds of  were used to reduce the pfgi ii term loan by  and to increase our working capital 
on november  we purchased the real estate underlying an existing restaurant from our landlord for  in connection with the real estate purchase we have entered into an additional sale leaseback agreement that is expected to close in january and we expect to recognize net proceeds of  we entered into an amendment to the pfgi ii loan agreement whereby we will repay the remaining loan balance out of the sale leaseback proceeds from the closing on this sale leaseback transaction
