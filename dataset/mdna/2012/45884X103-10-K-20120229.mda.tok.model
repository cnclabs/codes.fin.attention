includes million and million of non current available for sale securities as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the research  development and commercialization of innovative therapies in pulmonology and orphan fibrotic diseases 
we have an advanced stage product candidate in pulmonology  pirfenidone  that was granted marketing authorization effective february in all member countries of the european union eu for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf 
for an overview of additional information relating to our business  including actimmune and our product development programs  please see the discussion in item business overview 
pirfenidone esbriet pirfenidone is an orally active  small molecule compound under development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
in september  we launched commercial sales of pirfenidone in germany under the trade name esbriet  and we are continuing to prepare for the commercial launch of esbriet in the other countries in the eu 
subject to eu country reimbursement timelines  we currently plan to conclude pricing and reimbursement discussions for esbriet in france  spain and italy during the second quarter of and launch in those countries as soon as practicable after concluding discussions 
we currently plan to conclude the discussions with the authorities in the united kingdom in october of  and launch esbriet as soon as practicable thereafter 
in addition to launches in the so called top eu countries  we expect to launch esbriet in austria  denmark  ireland and norway in the first half of  and in belgium  the netherlands  finland and sweden in the second half of to support our anticipated commercialization efforts of esbriet in europe  we are currently investing in the establishment of a commercial infrastructure within the eu  including an increase to our employee headcount in that region 
on december   we announced several additions to our senior leadership team in support of our commercialization efforts as well as announcing the establishment of our european headquarters in reinach  switzerland  subsequently moved to muttenz  switzerland in early in december  we transferred all of our non us rights to research  develop and commercialize pirfenidone for ipf to our wholly owned swiss subsidiary  intermune international ag 
based on our current intellectual property portfolio  we expect to have exclusive rights to sell pirfenidone within the european union through in  we initiated a new phase clinical study to evaluate pirfenidone in ipf known as ascend in an effort to support approval of pirfenidone for the treatment ipf in the united states 
concurrent public offering in september  we completed a registered underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock and a concurrent registered underwritten public offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the aggregate net proceeds from our concurrent offerings was approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and related offering expenses 
we currently intend to use the net proceeds from these offerings to fund the commercial launch of esbriet in the eu  to fund our ascend trial and for general corporate purposes 
sale of danoprevir rights to roche in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with roche  subsequently amended  to develop and commercialize products from our hcv protease inhibitor program  including danoprevir 
pursuant to our collaboration with roche  we had successfully progressed the danoprevir compound from pre clinical testing into phase b clinical development 
in october  we sold our worldwide development and commercialization rights in danoprevir to roche for million in cash 
in connection with this transaction  the collaboration 
table of contents agreement that we and roche entered into in october was terminated 
roche has agreed to reimburse us for royalty and milestone obligations that we continue to have to novartis corporation and array related to danoprevir 
significant licenses and agreements we are highly dependent on technology that we have licensed or acquired from third parties 
actimmune  which is one of our two marketed products  is subject to a license agreement with genentech  inc effective november  we entered into asset purchase agreements with marnac and kdl whereby we effectively terminated our prior license agreement with them by purchasing  among other things  the pirfenidone related assets covered by such prior license agreement and as a result no longer have milestone or royalty obligations thereunder to marnac and kdl 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreements  we are required to make future milestone payments in connection with the continued development and regulatory approval of pirfenidone in certain countries 
the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under item business license  collaboration and other agreements  notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and under the heading results of operations below 
we paid million in march in connection with our decision to proceed with regulatory approval for pirfenidone and an additional million in connection with our clinical progress of danoprevir 
we may be required to make future contingent milestone payments to the owners of our licensed products or the suppliers of our drug compounds in accordance with our license  commercialization and collaboration agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the remaining milestones per the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
of the remaining million in aggregate milestone payments  million in contingent payments would be made by us only if positive phase data and product approval in the united states is achieved for pirfenidone 
potential milestone payments of million are related to the further development of actimmune  which we have no current plans to pursue  and therefore we do not expect to pay these amounts 
included in the million in future aggregate milestone payments are aggregate milestone payments of million payable to array and novartis  of which roche has agreed to reimburse us in connection with our sale of danoprevir to roche 
issuance of convertible debt in february  we issued convertible senior notes due march  the notes in an aggregate principal amount of million 
as of march   the holders of all of our then outstanding notes  approximately million in aggregate principal  elected to convert the outstanding notes into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
as a result  there are no notes that remain outstanding and we have no further obligations under the indenture governing the notes 
on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes to certain holders of our then outstanding notes in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of their notes 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior debt and rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated debt 
the notes were exchanged by us with the holders exclusively and solely for the notes in a transaction exempt from registration under section a of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes mature on march  and bear interest at a rate of per annum 
the holders of the notes may convert their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes representing a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
the conversion rate for the notes will be increased in certain circumstances that constitute a fundamental change of the company and in connection with a withholding tax redemption 
we can only settle conversion of the notes by delivery of shares of common stock 

table of contents in april  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue  in the aggregate  approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for  in the aggregate  million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the exchanges 
in september  we entered into an exchange agreement with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the exchange 
additionally  in september  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the agreements 
all of the convertible notes we acquired pursuant to the exchange agreements in september were retired upon the closing of the exchanges in october upon completion of ten trading days of our common stock necessary to determine the final number of shares to be issued 
all of the convertible notes we acquired pursuant to the exchange agreements in april and september were retired upon the closing of the debt exchanges 
need for additional capital we commenced operations in and have incurred significant losses to date 
our revenue has been limited primarily to sales of actimmune  which has been declining in recent years 
we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near term as we continue our preparations for the commercial launch of esbriet in the european union other than germany  including expanding our commercial infrastructure and related employee headcount  continue the development of pirfenidone for approval in the united states with the ongoing ascend phase clinical study  continue our research in the area of orphan fibrotic diseases  and continue to grow our operational capabilities 
although we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of esbriet and actimmune will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the next months  we may continue to require substantial additional funding in the future to realize the full commercial potential of our approved products and to complete our currently contemplated research and development activities 
as a result  we may attempt to raise additional funds through equity and or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if additional capital is not available to us or is not available to us on terms that are favorable  we may be forced to curtail our research and development activities  our commercialization activities  or we may be required to cease our operations entirely 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates 
table of contents that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
convertible debt on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board  accounting standards codification asc topic asc 
asc requires the issuer of convertible debt that may be settled in shares or cash upon conversion at their option  such as our million notes  to account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument  classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of similar debt without the conversion feature 
this required management to make estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates as of the date of original issuance  in addition to estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates as of our june debt extinguishment and the debt exchanges 
stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic under the fair value recognition provisions  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to estimate the value of share based awards  we use the black scholes model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from any of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
if all of the remaining and outstanding restricted stock awards that were granted in the past four years beginning in became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
if all of the remaining nonvested and outstanding stock option awards that have been granted became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
however  no compensation expense will be recognized for any stock awards that do not vest 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collectibility of the amounts receivable from the customer 
therefore  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer 
reserves are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts  if applicable 
we sell actimmune to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
regarding actimmune  we are obligated to accept returns from customers if the pharmaceuticals they purchased have reached their expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of actimmune returns based on historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
for each of the periods presented below  we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives and or in excess of our customers ordinary course of business inventory levels 
specialty wholesalers maintain low inventory levels and manage their inventory levels to optimize patient based need demand and generally do not overstock actimmune 

table of contents regarding our launch of esbriet in germany in september  we only ship product upon receipt of valid orders from customers such as pharmacies and hospitals which are the result of actual patient prescriptions 
pursuant to german medicinal products law  a customer has no right to return the product  therefore we have not established a reserve for product returns  though we have established a reserve for the mandatory rebate as allowed under the applicable german health care regulations  which is included in the medicaid and other rebates section below 
the tables below present the amounts reported as revenue reductions for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentages year ended december  reductions to revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid and other rebates total year ended december  gross product revenue revenue reductions as a of gross product revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid and other rebates total in  chargebacks were approximately of gross revenue  but prior to  had fallen within a range of to in any given year depending on the customer base 
the increase in the past three years above this range is primarily attributed to the tricare pharmacy program tricare which became effective january and is administered by the department of defense 
excluding tricare  chargebacks would have been approximately in  which would have increased reported revenue by approximately million 
in  medicaid rebates were approximately of gross revenue  showing steady increases since the increase in medicaid rebate revenue reductions from in and in to in is due to price increases for actimmune implemented during and the medicaid program limits price increases to a rate similar to the rate of inflation 
our price increases exceeded this limit  thereby significantly increasing our rebates to customers for those patients under the medicaid program 
additionally  in  we began selling esbriet in germany and the required mandatory rebate as described above is included herein 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing chargebacks is from the federal supply schedule  veterans administration and public health system pricing documents 
these documents establish the maximum price allowable for the sale of our product to a government customer 
the chargeback amount per unit is computed as the difference between our sales price to the wholesaler and the selling price from the wholesaler to a government customer 
chargebacks are processed directly by the wholesalers and are deducted from payments to us 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing medicaid rebates is from each of the states 
medicaid rebates are billed directly to us from each state 
billings from the states  which are based 
table of contents on end user reports submitted by pharmacies to the state agencies  are typically received within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we use historical billing and payment trends to assist us in determining an estimated medicaid rebate amount each period 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may overestimate or underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in the event we underestimate  we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
to date  we have not experienced changes in estimates that have led to material research and development expense adjustments being recorded in subsequent periods 
inventory reserves our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and our inventory costs are determined using the specific identification method which approximates first in first out 
we enter into purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 
we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments  if any  that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory purchase levels 
actimmune has an expiration date of months from the date of manufacture and the raw material used in the manufacture of esbriet has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture and an additional months once encapsulated into pill form 
as part of our on going excess inventory assessment for actimmune and esbriet  we also estimate the expiration date of any actimmune or esbriet to be manufactured in the future 
projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during and of million and million  respectively  to cost of goods sold for excess inventories 
there were no charges to cost of goods sold in for excess inventories 
if actimmune or esbriet revenue levels experienced in future periods are substantially below our current expectations  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories 
please refer to the statements under item a 
risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results may differ from our estimates 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenue for the year ended december   we recorded total net revenue of million  which includes esbriet product revenue of million  actimmune product revenue of million and collaboration revenue of million 
this compares to million and million of total revenue for the same periods in and  respectively 
the substantial decrease in revenue in as compared to is primarily due to the sale of our worldwide rights in danoprevir to roche in october which resulted in the recognition of million in collaboration revenue from the sale proceeds along with the acceleration of million of previously 
table of contents deferred revenue related to the termination of our collaboration agreement with roche 
we reported an increase in revenue in as compared to because of the sale of danoprevir as noted above 
this increase was partially offset by the year over year decrease we reported in actimmune product sales from million in to million in additional collaboration revenue in also includes approximately million of revenue related to the new collaboration agreement we entered into with roche in december  representing reimbursement for research services performed on their behalf 
the million of collaboration revenue for represents the remaining reimbursement for research services under the roche agreement  which has since been terminated 
the million of collaboration revenue for includes a million milestone payment which had been assessed as substantive and at risk at the initiation of the agreement and was therefore recognized as revenue when the milestone was achieved  as defined in the former collaboration agreement 
in and  respectively  collaboration revenue included approximately million and million of amortization of the aggregate million in upfront payments received from roche in and for each of the years ended december  and  actimmune accounted for all of our product revenue and was approximately million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes product manufacturing costs  royalties  distribution costs and inventory writedowns 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
gross margin for our products was  and for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decline in gross margin for the year ended december  compared with the same period in is primarily the result of a one time million royalty payment made to roche for reaching specified actimmune sales targets in mid additionally  in connection with our receipt of authorization to market esbriet in the european union  we made a milestone payment of million and have capitalized such payment as acquired product rights 
this asset is being amortized to cost of goods sold over the estimated useful life of esbriet and we incurred approximately million of amortization expense in excluding the royalty payment and amortization  product gross margin in was approximately 
included in and cost of goods sold are charges of million and million  respectively  recorded for excess inventories 
there were no charges in recorded for excess inventories and purchase commitments 
excluding the charges for excess inventory and purchase commitments in and  gross margins were approximately and of actimmune product revenue for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing an increase of in from and a decrease of in from the increase in r d expenses as compared to is primarily due to the preparation and initiation of the ascend trial and an increase in stock compensation expense of approximately million related to awards tied to the european commission s decision to grant marketing authorization for esbriet  partially offset by decreased expenses associated with a discontinuation of investment in the hcv portfolio following the divestiture of danoprevir in october of and completion of intermune s research agreement with roche in june the decrease in as compared to is primarily due to the timing of the preparation of regulatory filings related to pirfenidone and the divestiture of danoprevir in october based on current budgeted programs  r d expense is expected to be in a range of million to million in the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs and million  million and million of stock based 
table of contents compensation expense in  and  respectively 
our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the specific sections under item a 
risk factors above 
year ended december  development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology programs non specific total effective in  we discontinued our hcv development program 
historically  the largest component of our total operating expense was our ongoing investment in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the submission of an ind with the fda to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and the submission by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
in addition  due to these same factors and others  we are unable to reasonably estimate the efforts needed and  therefore  the costs we will incur to complete any of our projects or the estimated time to complete such projects 
we are also unable to provide costs incurred for specific research and development projects within each major development program as well as the cumulative costs incurred to date given that we do not maintain specific financial records to this level of detail 
however  a substantial majority of our resources have been invested in our pirfenidone and former danoprevir projects in order to advance them into phase and phase clinical development  respectively 
effective in  we have decided to cease further investment within our hepatology research programs and this therapeutic area 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and overall safety and efficacy profile as ultimately decided upon by the fda 
due to these factors  we believe it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
in addition  due to these same factors and others  we are unable to reasonably estimate the efforts needed and  therefore  the costs we will incur to complete any of our projects or the estimated time to complete such projects 

table of contents milestone payments to third parties we made no third party payments in or related to contractual milestone obligations that were charged directly to expense 
in  we made milestone payments of approximately million including approximately million in milestone payments made in connection with the initiation of the phase b study of danoprevir and a million milestone payment related to our pirfenidone program 
selling  general and administrative expenses general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing year over year increases of and  respectively 
the increased spending for the year ended december  compared with the same period in is attributed to the creation of our european infrastructure and investments in the pre launch and launch of esbriet in europe  including but not limited to additional headcount  as well as legal costs in connection with the global prosecution of our intellectual property portfolio  other regulatory and corporate matters  as well as expenses in connection with indemnification obligations to our former ceo 
the increase in our sg a expenses in compared with were primarily attributable to costs related to our preparation for the potential commercialization of pirfenidone in the us  the beginnings of a european infrastructure late in and transaction costs associated with the sale of danoprevir to roche in october based on current budgeted programs  sg a expense is expected to be in a range of million to million in restructuring charges following our receipt of the complete response letter from the fda requesting an additional clinical trial to support the efficacy of pirfenidone  we initiated a reduction in force in may resulting in an aggregate restructuring charge of approximately million during  consisting primarily of severance and benefits payments made to terminated employees 
in connection with the completion and announcement of our capacity trial results  we initiated a reduction in force in february we incurred approximately million of restructuring charges during consisting primarily of severance payments made to terminated employees 
loss on extinguishment of debt in april and september  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our notes to issue approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the notes then outstanding  see issuance of convertible debt above 
the exchange agreements were treated as induced conversions as the holders received a greater number of shares of common stock than would have been issued under the original conversion terms of the convertible notes 
at the time of the exchange agreements  none of the conversion contingencies were met 
under the original terms of the convertible notes  the amount payable on conversion was to be paid in cash  and the remaining conversion obligation stock price in excess of conversion price was payable in cash or shares  at our option 
under the terms of the exchange agreements  all of the settlement was paid in shares 
the difference in the value of the shares of common stock sold under the exchange agreements and the value of the shares used to derive the amount payable under the original conversion agreements resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million in the aggregate the inducement loss 
as required by asc  upon derecognition of the notes  we remeasured the fair value of the liability and equity components using a borrowing rate for similar non convertible debt that would be applicable to us at the date of the exchange agreements 
because borrowing rates increased  the remeasurement of the components of the convertible notes resulted in a gain on extinguishment of approximately million the revaluation gain 
as a result  we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million during the year ended december   calculated as the inducement loss  plus an allocation of advisory fees of approximately million  less the revaluation gain 
for more information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents interest income interest income was approximately million for each of the years ended december  and compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease in interest income reflects a conservative portfolio and therefore much lower average interest rates throughout and compared with interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in compared with reflects a decline in the amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes due and converted on march  as a result of the conversion  debt discount amortization was approximately million in  compared to million recorded in the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was primarily due to a decline in the amortization of the debt discount related to our notes  following the reduction in our convertible note obligation in  see issuance of convertible debt above 
during  the amortization of debt discount was approximately million  compared with million in  which reflects our adoption on january  of the guidance in asc additionally  and prior reflects declining interest expense recorded in connection with our liability under the government settlement reached in october other income expense other income expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million of other income in other expense in consists primarily of currency losses related to the unhedged portion of our non dollar denominated balance sheet exposures in connection with our european expansion 
other income in is comprised primarily of realized gains of approximately million from the sale of all of our remaining auction rate securities and includes approximately million related to the receipt of a federal research and development grant in the fourth quarter of pursuant to the federal qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp  partially offset by other expenses 
other income in consists primarily of realized gains of approximately million from the sale of our shares of targanta common stock 
provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from other non operating losses  we recorded a minimal provision for taxes for the year ended december  and a provision of approximately million for income taxes for the year ended december  we recorded a million deferred tax benefit in  primarily related to net operating losses that we had concluded to be realizable based on our estimate of future taxable income resulting from future potential sales of our shares of targanta common stock 
the million tax benefit was reversed in following our sale of targanta shares in as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will begin to expire in the year and federal orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately million that will begin to expire in the year in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million that begin to expire in and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
in general  section of the internal revenue code irc of  as amended  imposes annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  other tax carryforwards and certain built in losses  as defined under that section  upon an ownership change 
in general  an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than percentage points over such stockholders lowest percentage ownership 
table of contents during the testing period generally three years 
we have analyzed our historical ownership changes and removed any net operating loss carryforwards that will expire unutilized from our deferred tax balances as a result of irc section limitations 
in accordance with asc  we recorded a deferred charge during the year ended december  related to the deferral of income tax expense on inter company profits that resulted from the sale of our non us economic rights to esbriet to intermune international ag  a wholly owned subsidiary formed in the deferred charge is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the estimated life of the intellectual property 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic no 
 previously referred to as fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on january  implementation of asc topic no 
did not result in any adjustment to our consolidated statements of operations or a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million compared to million at december  in september  we completed a registered underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock and a concurrent registered underwritten public offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due notes 
the aggregate net proceeds from our concurrent offerings were approximately million 
the proceeds from these offerings were offset by additional funds used in the commercial launch of esbriet in the eu and for general corporate purposes 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  are sufficient to fund our operations  as currently contemplated  for at least the next months 
some of these available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our core operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
in addition  at any point in time we could have balances that exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis  these cash balances could be impacted and we may be unable to access our cash if the underlying financial institutions fail or if we become subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have not experienced a lack of access to cash in any of our third party financial institution accounts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all corporate issuers 
beginning in february  auctions failed for our entire portfolio of auction rate securities which had substantially limited the liquidity of those instruments 
however  in  we sold or redeemed our remaining portfolio of auction rate securities 
operating activities cash used in operating activities was approximately million during the year ended december   comprised primarily of a net loss of million  described more fully above under the section heading  results of operations  as well as changes to our working capital 
significant changes in working capital consisted of increases in accounts receivable  product inventory and prepaid expenses principally related to the initial launch of esbriet in germany in september additionally  accounts payable  accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities increased as a result of significant increases in headcount in europe and the initiation of the ascend clinical trial in the us in mid 
table of contents investing activities investing activities consumed approximately million in cash flow during the year ended december   primarily due to purchases of investments totaling million and the acquisition of product rights of million  partially offset by maturities and sales of available for sale securities totaling million 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities of approximately million for the year ended december  was due to the receipt of million in net proceeds from our concurrent public offerings of convertible debt and equity in september along with proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of approximately million 
we expect to incur net losses in the near term as we continue our preparations for the commercial launch of esbriet in the european union  continue the development of pirfenidone for approval in the united states with the ongoing ascend study  continue our research in the area of orphan fibrotic diseases  and continue to grow our operational capabilities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of esbriet and actimmune will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the next months 
this forward looking statement involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
this forward looking statement is also based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to capital requirements related to our commercial launch of esbriet in germany and preparations for the commercial launch of esbriet in other european union jurisdictions  including the expansion of our commercial infrastructure and related personnel and facility expenses  the timing and financial requirements of the ongoing phase clinical study of pirfenidone in the us ascend  sales of esbriet and actimmune or any of our product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  pricing and reimbursement from third payors for esbriet and actimmune  our ability to partner our programs or products  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  and the timing and size of payments we may receive from potential collaboration agreements 

table of contents as a result  we may require substantial additional capital and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for such fund raising activities at this time 
furthermore  additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of standard operating leases  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities  such as milestone payments  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments

 fair value measurement existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments 
many of these amendments were made to eliminate unnecessary wording differences between us gaap and international financial reporting standards  which could change how fair value measurement guidance in asc is applied 
asu no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate risk exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
substantially all investments mature within approximately one year from the date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
the table below presents the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate convertible senior notes due average interest rate 
table of contents the table below presents the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate convertible senior notes due average interest rate foreign currency market risk in connection with our continuing expansion efforts  we now conduct business throughout europe in several currencies  including the euro  swiss franc and british pound  among others 
therefore  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes  we enter into foreign currency contracts 
the company does not enter into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the short term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables and payables 
these derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments 
gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income expense and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances or other current assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
the company s foreign exchange forward contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement 
the company does  however  seek to mitigate such risks by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
in addition  the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored 
management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties 
global market and economic conditions in the united states and internationally  market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and sluggish economic growth beginning in for the fiscal year ended december   concerns about the systemic impact of inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  high unemployment and a declining real estate market in the us and added concerns fueled by the federal government interventions in the us financial and credit markets contributed to instability in both united states and international capital and credit markets and have diminished expectations for the us and global economy 
these conditions  which continued into  combined with volatile energy prices  declining business and consumer confidence and continued high unemployment have contributed to volatility in the markets and a broad economic slowdown 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of capital and credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
if volatile and adverse market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely borrow or access the capital and credit markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the economic slowdown may lead to reduced opportunities to raise sufficient additional capital to enable us to fund future operations  which would have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  the biotechnology industry has fluctuated significantly in the past and has experienced significant downturns in connection with  or in anticipation of  a deterioration in general economic conditions and we cannot accurately predict how severe and prolonged any downturn might be
