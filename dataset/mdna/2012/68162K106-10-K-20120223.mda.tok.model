item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading metals service center that operates in two reportable segments  flat products and tubular and pipe products 
we provide metal processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers 
our primary focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated  aluminum and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
commencing with the july  acquisition of chicago tube and iron company cti  we also distribute metal tubing  pipe  bar  valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets 
products that require more value added processing generally have a greater gross profit and higher margins 
accordingly  our overall gross profit is affected by  among other things  product mix  the amount of processing performed  the demand for and availability of metal  volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
we also perform toll processing of customer owned metal 
we sell certain products internationally  primarily in puerto rico and mexico 
international sales have been immaterial to our consolidated financial results 
our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including  but not limited to general and global business  economic  financial  banking and political conditions  competition  metal pricing  demand and availability  energy prices  pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals  inventory held in the supply chain  customer demand for metal  customers ability to manage their credit line availability  and layoffs or work stoppages by our own  our suppliers or our customers personnel 
the metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers  competitors and end use customers 
like many other service centers  we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we purchase metal in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts  historic buying practices  supply agreements with customers and market conditions 
our commitments to purchase metal are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders 
when metal prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
when metal prices decline  customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and  consequently  lower margins as we use existing metal inventory 
chicago tube and iron company acquisition on july   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of cti  pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated may  cti stocks  processes and fabricates metal tubing  pipe  bar  valves and fittings and pressure parts at nine operating facilities located primarily throughout the midwestern united states 
the acquisition of cti enhances our commercial opportunities by adding new product offerings to an expanded customer base and by increasing our distribution footprint 
we paid total cash consideration of million for cti  consisting of a base purchase price of million  plus the closing cash  working capital and mcneeley purchase agreement payments totaling approximately million 
in addition  we assumed approximately million of indebtedness and acquired million of cash from cti 
we funded our acquisition of cti primarily with borrowings under our million amended and restated loan and security agreement dated july  abl credit facility 
the five year abl credit facility includes a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 

table of contents during  we incurred thousand of direct acquisition related costs in connection with the acquisition of cti  which are included in administrative and general expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  reportable segments as a result of our acquisition of cti  we now operate in two reportable segments  flat products and tubular and pipe products 
flat products the primary focus of our flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated  aluminum and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
we act as an intermediary between metal producers and manufacturers that require processed metal for their operations 
we serve customers in most carbon steel consuming industries  including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment  construction and farm machinery  storage tanks  environmental and energy generation equipment  automobiles  food service and electrical equipment  military vehicles and equipment  as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force 
the flat products segment has strategically located processing and distribution facilities in the united states and one in monterrey  mexico 
this geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi national accounts  primarily located throughout the midwestern  eastern and southern united states 
in april  we purchased a building on us steel s gary works facility in gary  indiana  where we have located our new temper mill and cut to length line 
the facility became operational at the end of december in july  we entered into a lease to buy agreement for a facility in streetsboro  ohio for our specialty metals business 
the facility in streetsboro is expected to be operational in the second quarter of at the end of december  we purchased a second building in mt 
sterling  kentucky as we have already outgrown the facility we purchased in the facility in mt 
sterling is expected to become operational in the first quarter of tubular and pipe products the tubular and pipe products segment consists of the newly acquired cti business 
through our tubular and pipe products segment  we distribute metal tubing  pipe  bar  valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets 
founded in  cti is one of the largest steel service centers in the united states  with nine operations  primarily throughout the midwest

the company s tubular and pipe products segment consists of the recently acquired cti business  and the following discussion outlines this segment s impact on consolidated results from the acquisition date of july  through december  net sales in our tubular and pipe products segment were million or of consolidated net sales in  or of net sales for the second half of tubular and pipe products segment gross margins are higher than our historical flat products segment 
as part of purchase price accounting  certain cti inventory was adjusted to its fair market value or its selling price  and then subsequently expensed to cost of goods sold 
this resulted in lower tubular and pipe products segment gross margins of approximately million  or of segment sales 
as a percentage of net segment sales  gross profit totaled during operating expenses for the tubular and pipe products segment were million  or of net segment sales in operating income for this segment for totaled million or of net segment sales 
we anticipate tubular and pipe products segment sales will increase during due to strengthening customer demand in our key markets 
we expect segment gross profit percentages to remain at levels consistent with those of compared to during and  we operated as one segment 
any comparison between and relates to what is currently the flat products segment 
tons sold increased to thousand in from thousand in tons sold in included thousand from direct sales and thousand from toll processing  compared with thousand direct tons and thousand toll tons in tons sold in were higher in substantially all of our markets compared to in  tons sold were significantly depressed due to the impact of the global economic crisis

in  our gross profit margins were impacted by a larger percentage of sales made to the lower margin automotive industry  and increased sales of stainless steel and aluminum  which carries a lower gross profit percentage than carbon products 
we also  in certain instances  increased sales volume in at lower margins in order to gain market share in a recovering economy 

table of contents operating expenses in increased million  or  from as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses decreased to in from in as a result of the increased sales 
during  variable operating expenses such as distribution and selling costs increased as a result of increased shipment levels

net income for totaled million or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share for liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing  upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities and other businesses  making acquisitions and paying dividends 
we use cash generated from operations  leasing transactions and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements 
we believe that funds available under our abl credit facility  lease arrangement proceeds and the sale of equity or debt securities  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements  our dividend payments and any business acquisitions over at least the next months 
in the future  we may as part of our business strategy  acquire and dispose of assets or other companies in the same or complementary lines of business  or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures

working capital at december  totaled million  a million increase from december  the acquisition of cti contributed million of working capital at july  the increase in working capital  excluding working capital acquired  was million 
the increase was attributable to the rising price and volume environment  which increased our working capital requirements 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher sales volumes and sales prices  a million increase in inventories resulting from increased inventory purchases and higher metal prices  and a million increase in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and outstanding checks associated with higher steel prices

compared to operating activities during  we used million of net cash for operations  of which million was generated from operations and million was used for working capital 
working capital at december  totaled million  a million increase from december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher sales volumes and sales prices and a million increase in inventories  partially offset by a million decrease in income taxes receivable and deferred  a million increase in accounts payable associated with higher metal prices and increased metal receipts and a million increase in accrued expenses primarily associated with higher incentives and compensation

other than operating leases  which are disclosed above  as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased metal  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of metal and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
estimations are based upon the application of a historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance  which remains fairly level from year to year  and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers  which can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
we cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
we consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter 
inventory valuation flat products inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased metal  internal and external processing and inbound freight 
cost of our flat product segment s metal flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products is determined using the specific identification method 
as a result of the acquisition of cti  certain of our tubular metal products inventory is stated under the last in  first out  or lifo  method  which is not in excess of market 
at december   approximately million  or of consolidated inventory  was reported under the lifo method of accounting 
the cost of the remainder of cti s inventory is determined using a weighted average rolling first in  first out method 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill for our southern region  integrity stainless and cti operations and indefinite lived intangible assets for our cti operation in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment 
events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant nonperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value 
we estimate the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow methodology 
management s assumptions used for the calculations are based on historical results  projected financial information and recent economic events 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  or grouping of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
income taxes deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include  as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 

table of contents revenue recognition for both direct and toll shipments  revenue is recognized when metal is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss is transferred  which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers 
given the proximity of our customers to our facilities  substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day 
sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase price accounting business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires the company to record assets and liabilities of the business acquired at their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the company uses valuation specialists  where necessary  to perform appraisals and assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require management to make estimates and assumptions that are critical in determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  an accounting update was issued that amends current guidance related to multiemployer pension plan disclosures by increasing the quantitative and qualitative disclosures an employer is required to provide about its participation in multiemployer pension plans 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for public companies for fiscal years ending after december   with early adoption permitted and retrospective application to prior periods required 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements for the year ended december  in september  amended accounting guidance was issued intended to simplify how an entity tests for goodwill impairment 
the amended guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the two step quantitative impairment test is required if  based on its qualitative assessment  an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the amended guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this amended guidance in our goodwill impairment tests  and the adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  in june  new accounting guidance was issued regarding the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
this new guidance requires entities to present reclassification adjustments included in other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements and allows entities to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
it also eliminates the option for entities to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
for public companies  this accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
retrospective application to prior periods is required 
the adoption of this new guidance  effective for us on january   is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  new accounting guidance was issued on enhancing disclosures to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity s financial position 
the guidance requires improved information and disclosures about gross and net amounts of recognized assets and recognized liabilities of financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in an entity s statement of financial position 
the guidance is to be applied retrospectively for reporting periods beginning on or after january  the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal raw materials are carbon  coated and stainless steel  and aluminum  pipe and tube  flat rolled sheet  coil and plate that we typically purchase from multiple primary metal producers 
the metal industry as a whole is cyclical and  at times  pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control  including general domestic and international economic conditions  labor costs  sales levels  competition  levels of inventory held by other metals service centers  consolidation of metal producers  new global capacity by metal producers  higher raw material costs for the producers of metal  import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates 
this volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us 

table of contents we  like many other metals service centers  maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we purchase metal in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices  supply agreements with customers and market conditions 
our commitments to purchase metal are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders 
we have no long term  fixed price metal purchase contracts 
when metal prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
when metal prices decline  customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and  consequently  lower margins and inventory lower of cost or market adjustments as we sell existing inventory 
significant or rapid declines in metal prices or reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants in our credit facility  as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges 
changing metal prices therefore could significantly impact our net sales  gross margins  operating income and net income 
rising prices result in higher working capital requirements for us and our customers 
some customers may not have sufficient credit lines or liquidity to absorb significant increases in the price of metal 
while we have generally been successful in the past in passing on producers price increases and surcharges to our customers  there is no guarantee that we will be able to pass on price increases to our customers in the future 
declining metal prices have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income  while increasing metal prices  have generally favorably affected our net sales and net income 
approximately of our consolidated net sales in were directly to automotive manufacturers or manufacturers of automotive components and parts 
historically  due to the concentration of customers in the automotive industry  our gross margins on these sales have generally been less than our margins on sales to customers in other industries 
inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of steel and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past two years 
we are exposed to the impact of fluctuating metal prices and interest rate changes 
during and  we entered into nickel swaps at the request of customers 
while these derivatives are intended to be effective in helping us manage risk  they have not been designated as hedging instruments 
for certain customers  we enter into contractual relationships that entitle us to pass through the economic effect of trading positions that we take with other third parties on our customers behalf 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt
