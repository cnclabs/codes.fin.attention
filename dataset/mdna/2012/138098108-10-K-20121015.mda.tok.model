this segment also offers both a mail in service and in office spore test kits for healthcare professionals to verify the performance of their sterilizers 
dialysis medical device reprocessing systems  sterilants disinfectants  dialysate concentrates and other supplies for renal dialysis 
therapeutic filtration hollow fiber membrane filtration and separation technologies for medical applications 
included in all other reporting segment 
specialty packaging specialty packaging and thermal control products  as well as related compliance training  for the transport of infectious and biological specimens and thermally sensitive pharmaceutical  medical and other products 
included in all other reporting segment 
chemistries sterilants  disinfectants  detergents and decontamination services used in various applications for infection prevention and control 
included in all other reporting segment 
most of our equipment  consumables and supplies are used to help prevent or control the occurrence or spread of infections 
significant activity i in fiscal compared with fiscal  net sales and net income increased by and  respectively  to record levels for a fiscal year 
we continue to benefit from having a broad portfolio of infection prevention and control products sold into diverse business segments  where approximately of our net sales are attributable to consumable products and service 
the primary factors that contributed to this financial performance  as further described elsewhere in this md a  were as follows incremental sales and net income inclusive of acquisition related costs  favorable acquisition related fair value adjustments and higher interest expense in our endoscopy segment as a result of our acquisition of the business and substantially all of the assets of byrne medical  inc bmi  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  significant increases in sales volume of endoscope reprocessing disinfectants  consumables and services as a result of the increased field population of equipment  improved sales and profitability in our water purification and filtration segment primarily relating to increased sales of our capital equipment and service in the dialysis industry due to new product introductions  such as heat sanitizable water purification systems  and the impact of our acquisition of the united states water purification business of gambro renal products  inc grp and a swedish based affiliate of grp the gambro business or the gambro acquisition on october   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and improved sales and profitability in our healthcare disposables segment primarily due to increased demand for our face masks and the decreasing price of raw materials  as well as the impact of our acquisition of the sterilization monitoring business of confirm monitoring systems  inc the confirm monitoring business or the confirm acquisition on february   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the above factors were partially offset by decreases in sales volume of our endoscope reprocessing equipment as these capital equipment sales were elevated in the prior year partially as a result of our participation in a major initiative by the veterans administration to upgrade their hospitals endoscope reprocessing equipment as well as regulatory issues experienced by a major competitor  decreases in net sales and profitability in our dialysis  therapeutic filtration and chemistries operating segments  increased investment in research and development activities  an increase in our consolidated effective tax rate  which increase was partially offset by a tax benefit relating to the closing of our japan location as further explained below  and the impairment of an investment during our second quarter of fiscal  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
ii we sell our dialysis products to a concentrated number of customers 
sales in our dialysis segment were adversely impacted by the continued loss of some lower margin dialysate concentrate business as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for such product  as well as the decrease in demand for our renatron reprocessing equipment  sterilants and reprocessing supplies  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
this reduction in dialysis sales has reduced overall profitability in this segment 
our market for dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers  which market has been decreasing in the united states despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single use dialyzers 
a further decrease in the market for dialysis concentrate and reprocessing products is likely to result in continued loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability in this segment in the future

iii on august  our subsidiary medivators inc f k a minntech corporation medivators acquired the business and substantially all of the assets of bmi  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain components of the acquisition s purchase price were recorded at fair value and are continually re measured at each balance sheet date  which has the potential for creating earnings volatility in the future as further described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
iv in conjunction with the acquisition of the business and substantially all of the assets of bmi and the impending expiration of our existing credit facility  we entered into a  second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of august  with our senior lenders to fund the cash consideration paid and the costs associated with the acquisition  as well as to refinance our working capital credit facilities under an existing credit agreement  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into interest rate swap agreements in fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
v in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of the legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a excise tax on all us medical device sales beginning in january since a significant portion of our sales are considered medical device sales under this new legislation  our gross profit percentage will be adversely affected beginning in january  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
vi as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner  we closed medivators japan location in july although this event had an insignificant impact on our income before taxes  we recorded a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal reducing our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal by over basis points 
this tax benefit increased both basic and diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter by approximately  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
vii in order to more fully capitalize on the strength of the medivators brand name currently used in our endoscopy business  we decided to change the name of minntech corporation to medivators 
the name change was effective on august  viii the company issued  additional shares of common stock in connection with a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on february  to stockholders of record on january   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
ix on october   we announced an increase in the semiannual cash dividend to per share per share on a pre split basis of outstanding common stock  which was paid on each of january  and july   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
x in fiscal  we acquired the gambro business on october  and the confirm monitoring business on february   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
xi in fiscal  we acquired the business of purity water company of san antonio  inc purity business or purity acquisition on june   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the results of operations described below reflect the operating results of cantel and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
since the acquisition of bmi s disposable endoscopy products business the byrne medical business or the byrne acquisition was completed on august   its results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscal and are not reflected in our results of operations for fiscals and the byrne medical business is included in the endoscopy segment 
since the acquisitions of the gambro business and confirm monitoring business were completed on october  and february   respectively  their results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscal and the portion of fiscal subsequent to their acquisition dates  and are not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal the gambro business is included in the water purification and filtration segment and the confirm monitoring business is included in the healthcare disposables segment 
since the acquisition of the purity business was completed on june   its results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscals and and the portion of fiscal subsequent to its acquisition date 
the purity business is included in the water purification and filtration segment 
the following table gives information as to the net sales and the percentage to the total net sales for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands endoscopy water purification and filtration healthcare disposables dialysis all other fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscopy products and services  water purification and filtration products and services and healthcare disposables products  partially offset by a decrease in sales of dialysis products 
net sales of endoscopy products and services increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i net sales in fiscal of  due to the acquisition of the byrne medical business on august  and ii increases in demand in the united states for our disinfectants  service  consumables and equipment accessories due to the significant increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment in fiscal demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment had been elevated during the second half of fiscal and the three months ended october  due to our previous investments in new product offerings and sales and marketing programs as well as regulatory issues experienced by a major competitor  all of which enabled us to increase our sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment including successfully participating in a major initiative beginning in the second half of fiscal by the veterans administration to upgrade their hospitals endoscope reprocessing equipment 
beginning in our second quarter of fiscal  this elevated level of capital equipment sales gradually decreased to a similar level that existed prior to the second half of fiscal however  we expect disinfectants  service  consumables and equipment accessories to continue to benefit from the increased installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment 
changes in selling prices did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i increases in demand for our water purification capital equipment and service in the dialysis industry including the impact of the prior year acquisition of the gambro business on october   ii incremental net sales attributable to new product introductions such as heat sanitizable water purification systems and iii higher selling prices of our water purification products and services  which favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in demand for capital equipment used for commercial and industrial applications 
net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by  or in fiscal compared with fiscal principally due to i incremental net sales of approximately  in fiscal attributable to the prior year acquisition of the confirm monitoring business on february   ii higher selling prices  which favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  and iii an increase in customer demand for our face masks 
net sales of dialysis products and services decreased by  or in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the expected adverse impact of losing some dialysate concentrate business a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment from domestic customers as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for this lower margin commodity product and ii a decrease in demand primarily in the united states including a decrease from our largest dialysis customer  davita  inc davita for our renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment  sterilants and reprocessing supplies 
due to sales price decreases by some of our competitors  we expect a continued decrease in net sales of our lower margin dialysate concentrate product in the future as we elect not to pursue unprofitable concentrate sales 
furthermore  our market for dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers  which market has been decreasing in the united states despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single use dialyzers 
the shift from reusable to single use dialyzers is principally due to the lowering cost of single use dialyzers  the ease of using a dialyzer one time  and the commitment of fresenius medical care  the largest dialysis provider chain in the united states and a manufacturer of single use dialyzers  to convert dialysis clinics performing reuse to single use facilities 
in addition  davita has been evaluating the economics and other factors associated with single use versus reuse on a market by market basis 
this evaluation has resulted in the conversion by davita of certain clinics from reuse to single use and in many cases the opening of new clinics as single use clinics 
a further decrease in the market for dialysis concentrate and reprocessing products is likely to result in continued loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability and operating cash flow in this segment in the future 
additionally  our dialysis segment is highly dependent upon davita as a customer and any further shift by this customer away from reuse would have a material adverse effect on our dialysis segment net sales 
changes in selling prices of our dialysis products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased compared with fiscal primarily due to i the acquisition of the byrne medical business  which products carry a higher gross profit percentage  ii more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain higher margin products such as sterilants in our endoscopy segment and face masks in our healthcare disposables segment and decreases in sales volume of lower margin products such as endoscope reprocessing equipment in our endoscopy segment  iii improved gross margins in our water purification and filtration segment as a result of the full integration of the gambro business into our minnesota manufacturing facility  iv increases in selling prices in our water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables segments  and v a decrease in raw materials costs primarily in our healthcare disposables segment due to the decreasing price of oil 
in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of the legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a excise tax on all us medical device sales beginning in january since a significant portion of our sales are considered medical device sales under this new legislation  we will record the excise tax in cost of sales thereby adversely affecting our gross profit percentage beginning in january if this legislation had been effective throughout fiscal  we estimate that our annual excise tax would have been within the range of  to  which would have directly decreased our gross profit by such amount 
although we plan to implement further cost reductions and revenue enhancement initiatives to partially offset this new excise tax  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in significantly reducing the impact of this tax on our business 
additionally  other elements of this legislation could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business in the future 
see risk factors elsewhere in this form k 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurances that our gross profit percentage will not be adversely affected in the future i by uncertainties associated with our product mix  ii by price competition in certain of our segments such as healthcare disposables  endoscopy and dialysis or iii if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement price increases 
additionally  despite expensive shipping costs  some of our competitors manufacture certain healthcare disposable products in china and southeast asia due to lower overall costs 
although we believe the quality of our healthcare disposable products  which are generally produced in the united states  are superior to similar products produced in china and southeast asia  we may experience significant pricing pressure that would adversely affect our gross profit in the future in our healthcare disposables segment as a result of low cost competition from products produced in china and southeast asia 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to i the inclusion of  of selling expenses relating to the byrne medical business in fiscal  ii approximately  in compensation expense exclusive of the acquired byrne medical business relating to annual salary raises  additional sales personnel primarily in our endoscopy segment  employee benefit costs and severance expense primarily in our therapeutic filtration and chemistries segments and iii higher marketing costs of approximately  primarily in our chemistries  healthcare disposables and endoscopy segments  partially offset by approximately  in lower commission expense due to changing the structure of our endoscopy sales commission plan  which had previously included additional commissions for achieving certain year to date sales targets 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscals and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to i the inclusion of  of general and administrative expenses relating to the byrne medical business  which includes approximately  in amortization of intangible assets   in acquisition related expenses and a  reduction in expenses relating to fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and a price floor financial instrument as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and ii approximately  in compensation expense exclusive of the acquired byrne medical business relating to annual salary raises  higher incentive compensation  additional administrative personnel  employee benefit costs and stock based compensation expense  including  in additional stock based compensation related to an employment termination which required us to accelerate the vesting of certain stock options and restricted shares 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to development work on certain new products in our endoscopy segment  including new projects and continuing engineering costs related to the byrne acquisition 
operating income by segment the following table gives information as to the amount of operating income  as well as operating income as a percentage of net sales  for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands endoscopy water purification and filtration healthcare disposables dialysis all other operating income general corporate expenses income before interest  other income and income taxes the endoscopy segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the acquisition of the byrne medical business on august  which generated sales of  at a higher gross margin percentage than our pre acquisition endoscopy segment but also had higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our pre acquisition endoscopy segment such operating expenses were partially offset by favorable fair value adjustments of  as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  ii increases in demand in the united states for our disinfectants  service and consumables  which are higher margin products  due to the significant increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment and iii lower commission expense  partially offset by a decrease in demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment and higher research and development expense  as further explained above 
the water purification and filtration segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to increased net sales and improved gross profit as a percentage of net sales  as further explained above 
the healthcare disposables segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the prior year acquisition of the confirm monitoring business on february  which generated incremental net sales of approximately  in fiscal at a higher gross margin percentage  ii higher selling prices and iii an increase in customer demand for our face masks  partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses  as further explained above 
the dialysis segment s operating income decreased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a decrease in net sales of higher margin products  such as our sterilants and renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment  and our lower margin dialysate concentrate product  as further explained above 
operating income in our all other reporting segment decreased by  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to decreases in operating income of  or  in our therapeutic filtration operating segment and  or  in our chemistries operating segment 
the decrease in operating income in the therapeutic filtration segment was primarily due to i a reduction in sales demand for certain higher margin products including filters manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system who had phased out the use of our filter for their product  ii an increase in research and development expenses  iii the inclusion of costs associated with the closing of our japan location in july as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner and iv the recording of severance expense related to changes in the segment s management structure 
the decrease in operating income in the chemistries segment  which has been unprofitable due to being in a start up phase  was primarily due to i an increase in marketing expenses  ii the recording of severance expense related to changes in the segment s management structure and iii the inclusion of costs associated with the closing of our japan location 
general corporate expenses relate to certain unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel and being a publicly traded company 
the increase in such costs in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to the addition of internal and external resources  higher compensation expense including incentive compensation and an increase in corporate initiatives 
interest interest expense increased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to increases in average outstanding borrowings and average interest rates relating to the august  acquisition of the byrne medical business  as further described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements in february in which we agree to exchange our variable interest cash flows with fixed interest cash flows provided by one of our existing senior lenders  as further described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal other expense in our second quarter of fiscal  a  loss was recorded in other expense relating to the impairment of our investment in senior subordinated convertible promissory notes issued by biosafe  inc biosafe  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and in fiscals and  respectively 
the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate was principally due to the expiration of federal tax legislation relating to the research and experimentation tax credit  the unfavorable impact of recording a loss relating to the impairment of an investment  the ability to use foreign tax credits in the prior year relating to foreign repatriations and the geographic mix of pre tax income  partially offset by recording a tax benefit in fiscal relating to the closing of our japan location  as described below 
in fiscals and  approximately and  respectively  of our income before income taxes was generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate of and  respectively 
the higher overall effective tax rate in fiscal was principally caused by i the december  expiration of federal tax legislation relating to the research and experimentation tax credit which as a result prevented us from claiming a larger tax credit in fiscal as compared with fiscal  ii not recognizing a tax benefit on the loss relating to the impairment of our biosafe investment  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  due to the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future and iii the recording of a tax credit in the prior year relating to the repatriation of  from one of our canadian subsidiaries in fiscal in fiscals and  approximately and  respectively  of our income before income taxes was generated from our subsidiary in japan  which we closed in july as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner 
the closing of our japan location had an insignificant impact on our consolidated income before income taxes in fiscal because the losses from the write down of this investment recorded in our united states financial statements were offset by related gains recorded in our japan subsidiary financial statements excluding approximately  in severance and other closing costs 
these gains  which are not indicative of normal operating activities  were the primary reason why our japan subsidiary generated approximately of our income before income taxes 
however  as a portion of these gains were not taxable in japan and due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards in japan  we did not record income tax expense on the gains 
conversely  we recorded an income tax benefit in the united states on the investment losses as we are able to claim a worthless stock tax deduction on our united states tax return 
consequently  our consolidated income tax expense was reduced by approximately  in our fourth quarter of fiscal  which increased both basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately 
excluding the favorable tax impact of this event  our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal would have been 
in fiscals and  approximately and of our income before income taxes was generated from our operations in canada  singapore and the netherlands 
collectively  these operations had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
all three of these locations have lower statutory income tax rates compared to the united states 
the higher overall effective tax rates in fiscal was due to the recognition of tax benefits upon resolution of income tax uncertainties  as more fully described below  which tax benefits were larger in the prior year in relation to income before income taxes for these foreign operations 
in fiscal  our combined taxable income that we expect to include in our federal domestic and foreign tax returns is estimated to be approximately  compared to income before taxes of  in our consolidated statements of income 
such amount expected to be reported in our tax returns is estimated and subject to change 
the largest contributing factors for the difference between these two amounts relate to our domestic operations and include the following major components i timing differences between when we are required to record tax benefits in our consolidated financial statements and when we are able to record tax deductions on our tax returns relating to assets and liabilities acquired in conjunction with acquisitions  ii stock based compensation and iii state income taxes which are deductible for federal purposes 
in the future  the timing of these items may vary from year to year depending on several factors such as the amount and timing of employee gains from option exercises and vesting of restricted stock awards 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authorities 
any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations 
however  if our unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our overall effective tax rate due to the size of the unrecognized tax benefits in relation to our income before income taxes 
we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on july  increase for current period tax position lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july  the company is currently being audited by the internal revenue service for fiscal year our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax decrease in earnings per common share due to stock based compensation basic diluted the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the related income tax benefits were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and a reduction to income tax expense 
all of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are expected to be deductible for tax purposes  except for certain options and restricted shares granted to employees residing outside of the united states  and were tax effected using the company s estimated us effective tax rate at the time of grant 
in january  in connection with an employment termination  we were required to accelerate the vesting of certain stock options and restricted shares resulting in an additional  of stock based compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications of existing awards  accelerated vesting related to certain employment terminations and assumptions used in determining estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
if the market price of our common stock increases or factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  the compensation expense that we would record for future stock awards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
all of our stock options and stock awards are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense before income taxes related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised or restricted stock becomes vested  the company is allowed a deduction on its united states income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as a reduction of previously recorded long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense which was determined based upon the award s fair value at the time the award is granted 
the differences noted above between actual tax deductions and the previously recorded long term deferred income tax assets are recorded as additional paid in capital 
in fiscals and  such income tax deductions reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively  and increased additional paid in capital by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscopy products and services and water purification and filtration products and services  partially offset by a decrease in dialysis products and therapeutic filtration products 
net sales of endoscopy products and services increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in worldwide demand  especially in the united states  for i our endoscope reprocessing equipment and ii our equipment accessories  disinfectants  consumables and service due to the increased field population of equipment 
we attribute the increased demand in our endoscope reprocessing equipment to i our investments in new product offerings and sales and marketing programs  ii regulatory issues experienced by a major competitor  iii successfully participating in a major initiative by the veterans administration to upgrade their hospitals endoscopy equipment in a significant portion of their system and iv improved economic conditions relating to capital equipment purchases 
we believe that at least half of the increase in endoscopy sales in fiscal was due to our competitor s regulatory issues and our participation in this veterans administration initiative 
in fiscal we expect this elevated level of capital equipment sales to return to a level that existed in prior periods 
however  in the future we expect disinfectants  consumables and service sales to benefit from the increased installed base of equipment 
partially offsetting these increases were lower selling prices  which adversely impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  and primarily related to the significant volume of sales to government entities  such as veterans administration hospitals  as well as other large hospital groups which received discounted pricing 
net sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by approximately  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i incremental net sales attributable to the gambro acquisition of approximately  in fiscal  ii an increase in demand for our sterilants and filters within our installed equipment base of business  iii an increase in demand in fiscal for capital equipment used for commercial and industrial applications and iv approximately  in higher net sales as a result of higher selling prices that were implemented to offset corresponding cost increases 
net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by  in fiscal compared with fiscal principally due to i higher selling prices  which favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by  and were implemented to offset the rising cost of raw materials  ii increased demand for our sterilization accessories as a result of favorable sales and marketing initiatives  and iii incremental net sales of approximately  attributable to the confirm acquisition on february  partially offsetting these increases was a decline in net sales of approximately  during the first four months of the current year period as a result of reduced sales volume of higher margin face masks and other healthcare disposables products that were in strong demand during the prior year outbreak of the novel hn flu swine flu 
although the outbreak of the novel hn flu resulted in strong sales volume of higher margin face masks and other healthcare disposables products during the first four months of fiscal  such sales volume has returned to a sales level that is similar to that which existed prior to the outbreak of the novel hn flu  with the exception of sales to certain distributors who were overstocked with face masks for much of fiscal  given that the elevated level of reported cases of influenza viruses has subsided and a new outbreak has not occurred 
atypical demand for face masks is highly dependent upon the severity and timing of any pandemic flu outbreak such as the recent novel hn flu  the ability of our company to educate existing customers and potential new customers on the benefits of our face masks  disinfectants and other products and the level of urgency our customers  government agencies and the general public develop and maintain with respect to epidemic and pandemic preparedness 
net sales of dialysis products and services decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the expected adverse impact of losing some dialysate concentrate business a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment from domestic and international customers as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for this lower margin commodity product  as well as various global economic factors with respect to international demand  and ii a decrease in demand in the united states including a decrease from our largest dialysis customer  davita  inc davita for our renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment  sterilants and reprocessing supplies 
due to sales price decreases by some of our competitors  we expect a continued decrease in net sales of our lower margin dialysate concentrate product in the future as we elect not to pursue unprofitable concentrate sales 
furthermore  fresenius medical care fresenius  the largest dialysis provider chain in the united states  manufactures dialysate concentrate themselves and no longer purchases that product from us 
our market for dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers  which market has been decreasing in the united states despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single use dialyzers 
the shift from reusable to single use dialyzers is principally due to the lowering cost of single use dialyzers  the ease of using a dialyzer one time  and the commitment of fresenius  a manufacturer of single use dialyzers  to convert dialysis clinics performing reuse to single use facilities 
in addition  davita has been evaluating the economics and other factors associated with single use versus reuse on a market by market basis 
this evaluation has resulted in the conversion by davita of certain clinics from reuse to single use and in many cases the opening of new clinics as single use clinics 
a further decrease in the market for dialysis concentrate and reprocessing products is likely to result in continued loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability in this segment in the future 
additionally  our dialysis segment is highly dependent upon davita as a customer and any further shift by this customer away from reuse would have a material adverse effect on our dialysis segment net sales 
changes in selling prices of our dialysis products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales in the all other reporting segment decreased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a decrease of  or  in net sales in our therapeutic filtration operating segment 
the decrease in net sales in our therapeutic filtration operating segment was due to i a reduction in higher margin sales in the united states of filters manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system as a result of our customer phasing out the use of our filters  and ii a decrease in demand for our hemoconcentrator products a device used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery  both in the united states and internationally 
increases in selling prices of our therapeutic filtration  specialty packaging and chemistries products did not have a significant effect on net sales in the all other segment in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in net sales of our therapeutic filtration operating segment coupled with the increase in research and development expenses in our chemistries operating segment  as further explained below  were the primary contributors to the significant decrease in operating income in the all other reporting segment 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
the gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal primarily due to i a less favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain lower margin products  such as the significant increase in capital equipment sales in our endoscopy segment  and with respect to the first four months of fiscal  a decrease in sales volume of high margin face masks  disinfectants and other healthcare disposables products that were in strong demand during the prior year outbreak of the novel hn flu swine flu  ii the inclusion of sales with lower gross margin as a result of acquiring gambro water which has a cumbersome and expensive international supply chain that we are reconstituting in the united states  iii an increase in raw materials and distribution costs primarily due to the higher price of oil and iv an increase in warranty expense in our endoscopy segment primarily during our fourth quarter of fiscal we cannot provide assurances that our gross profit percentage will not be further adversely affected in the future i by price competition in certain of our segments such as healthcare disposables  endoscopy and dialysis  ii by uncertainties associated with our product mix or iii if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement price increases 
additionally  despite expensive shipping costs  some of our competitors manufacture certain healthcare disposable products in china and southeast asia due to lower overall costs 
although we believe the quality of our healthcare disposable products  which are generally produced in the united states  is superior to similar products produced in china and southeast asia  we expect to experience significant pricing pressure that will adversely affect our gross profit in the future in our healthcare disposables segment as a result of low cost competition from products produced in china and southeast asia 
notwithstanding the above  the byrne medical business acquired on august   as more fully described in business recent acquisition subsequent to july  and note to the consolidated financial statements  has historically had a gross profit percentage in excess of  which will have a favorable impact on our overall gross profit percentage in the future 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to commissions on increased sales by our endoscopy direct sales force and to a lesser extent  additional sales personnel principally in our endoscopy and water purification and filtration segments 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscals and  respectively 
the increase in our selling expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our strategic decision to invest in selling initiatives designed to expand into new markets and gain or maintain market share 
in particular  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in our fourth quarter of fiscal were higher than previous quarters primarily due to the structure of our endoscopy sales commission plan  which included additional commissions for achieving certain year to date sales targets 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to increases of i approximately  in acquisition related costs including  in our fourth quarter principally associated with the acquisitions of the byrne medical business  the confirm monitoring business and gambro water  ii approximately  in compensation expense relating to annual salary raises  additional administrative personnel  employee benefit costs and stock based compensation expense  iii  in amortization expense of intangible assets primarily related to our acquisitions of the confirm monitoring business  gambro water and purity and iv approximately  in additional bad debt expense 
we will incur additional acquisition related costs during our fiscal first quarter in connection with the acquisition of the byrne medical business 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to development work on certain new products in our chemistries operating segment  which was recently created at the end of fiscal for fiscal  we intend to continue our acceleration of investments in research and development across various infection prevention and control opportunities 
interest interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to due to decreases in average outstanding borrowings and average interest rates 
interest income increased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to increasing our investment in senior subordinated convertible promissory notes issued by biosafe  inc biosafe during the prior year  as well as an increase in the interest rate on such notes  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
income from operations before taxes income before income taxes decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a lower gross profit percentage and higher selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses  partially offset by higher sales and lower interest expense  as further explained above 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and in fiscals and  respectively 
the decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate was principally due to the geographic mix of pre tax income  the impact of various federal tax legislation changes and a lower level of tax relating to cash repatriations from our foreign subsidiaries  as described below 
the majority of our income before income taxes was generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
the lower overall effective tax rate in fiscal was principally caused by i less income taxes related to foreign repatriations as we had provided for income taxes in fiscal on the current year repatriation of  from one of our canadian subsidiaries  ii federal tax legislation enacted in december that enabled us to claim the research and experimentation tax credit and iii federal tax legislation that is now fully phased in which enabled us to claim a larger income tax deduction offered to united states manufacturers 
approximately of our income before income taxes was generated from our canadian operations in fiscal compared with approximately of our income before income taxes in fiscal our canadian operations had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
the low overall effective tax rate for both periods was due to the low corporate tax structure in canada as well as the recognition of tax benefits upon resolution of income tax uncertainties  as more fully described below 
in fiscals and  approximately and  respectively  of our income before income taxes was generated from our operations in singapore  a country with a low corporate tax structure 
the overall effective tax rate for our singapore operation was and in fiscals and  respectively 
approximately of our income before income taxes was generated from our subsidiary in japan in fiscal compared with a small loss in the prior year period 
due to the uncertainty of our japan subsidiary utilizing tax benefits in the future  a tax benefit was not recorded on the losses from operations at our japan subsidiary in fiscal  thereby adversely affecting our overall consolidated effective tax rate in the prior year period 
in fiscal  our japan operation was slightly profitable and we recorded no income taxes due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
the results of operations for our netherlands subsidiary did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate in fiscals and due to the size of income before income taxes generated from this operation 
in fiscal  our combined taxable income that we expect to include in our domestic and foreign tax returns is estimated to be approximately  compared to income before taxes of  in our consolidated statements of income 
such amount expected to be reported in our tax returns is estimated and subject to change 
the largest contributing factor for the difference between these two amounts was the repatriation from our canadian subsidiary 
such a transaction between cantel and its wholly owned subsidiary is eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but is included as taxable income in our domestic tax returns 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authorities 
some of our unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions 
any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations 
however  if our unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our overall effective tax rate due to the size of the unrecognized tax benefits in relation to our income before income taxes 
except for decreases due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation  we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on july  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  increase for current period tax position lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax decrease in earnings per common share due to stock based compensation basic diluted the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the related income tax benefits were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and a reduction to income tax expense 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications of existing awards and assumptions used in determining fair value  expected lives and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which historically was and is now approximately as we began paying dividends in fiscal  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc topic in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
all of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  before income taxes  related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards which are expected to vest was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
however  on october   the company granted  restricted shares to of its employees  including its executive officers  at a fair value of per share 
the granting of these shares will result in additional stock based compensation expense of  that will be recorded evenly over the three year vesting period ending october  if certain criteria are met when options are exercised or restricted stock becomes vested  the company is allowed a deduction on its united states income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as a reduction of deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and as a reduction of income taxes payable  with differences between actual tax deductions and the related deferred income tax assets recorded as additional paid in capital 
in fiscals and  such income tax deductions reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense which was determined based upon the award s fair value 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at july   our working capital was  compared with  at july  this increase was primarily due to the significant growth in operating income primarily from our three largest segments  endoscopy  water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables  as more fully explained elsewhere in this md a  and the fiscal byrne acquisition  which contributed total working capital of  on the date of acquisition  partially offset by the  increase in the current portion of long term debt relating to the acquisition of the byrne medical business  as further explained below 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and a decrease in accounts receivable due to strong collections of receivables in the endoscopy segment  partially offset by an increase in inventories due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our endoscopy and water purification and filtration segments 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and deferred taxes and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities due primarily to the timing associated with vendor payments and income taxes payable due to timing of payments  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable primarily due to strong sales of endoscopy products and services and water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables products and inventories due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our healthcare disposables and endoscopy segments 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and deferred income taxes and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities due to an increase in customer deposits relating to capital equipment sales in our water purification and filtration segment and income taxes payable due to timing of payments  partially offset by increases in inventories due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our healthcare disposables and endoscopy segments and accounts receivable due to strong july sales in our endoscopy segment 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisition of the byrne medical business and to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the gambro acquisition and the confirm acquisition as well as capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for capital expenditures and the purity acquisition 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  and  in fiscals and  respectively  compared with net cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal in fiscal  the net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to borrowings under our credit facilities relating to the acquisition of the byrne medical business  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to borrowings under our revolving credit facility relating to the gambro acquisition and confirm acquisition and proceeds from the exercises of stock options  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities  the payments of dividends to our shareholders and the purchases of treasury shares 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to repayments under our credit facilities and the payment of dividends to our shareholders  partially offset by proceeds from the exercises of stock options 
dividends in fiscal  we declared our first semiannual cash dividends of per share per share on a pre split basis of outstanding common stock  which were paid on each of january  and july  and totaled  in fiscal  we announced an increase in the semiannual cash dividend to per share per share on a pre split basis of outstanding common stock  which was paid on each of january  and july  and totaled  in fiscal  we announced another increase in the semiannual cash dividend to per share per share on a pre split basis of outstanding common stock  which was paid on each of january  and july  and totaled  future declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of the company s board of directors 
on february   the company issued  additional shares of common stock in connection with a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on february  to stockholders of record on january  long term contractual obligations as of july   aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long term components are as follows year ended july  amounts in thousands thereafter total maturities of the credit facilities expected interest payments under the credit facilities minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases acquisitions payable compensation agreements deferred compensation and other total contractual obligations the expected interest payments under the term and revolving credit facility reflect interest rates of and  which was our weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at july  and reflects the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 
new us credit agreement in conjunction with the byrne acquisition and the impending expiration of our existing revolving credit facility existing revolver facility  we entered into a  second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of august  the new us credit agreement with our existing consortium of senior lenders to fund the cash consideration paid and the costs associated with the acquisition  as well as to refinance our existing revolver facility 
the new us credit agreement includes i a five year  senior secured revolving credit facility with sublimits of up to  for letters of credit and up to  for swing line loans the revolving credit facility and ii a  senior secured term loan facility the term loan facility 
the new us credit agreement expires on august  amounts we repay under the term loan facility may not be reborrowed 
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent  the company may from time to time increase the revolving credit facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed  without the consent of the lenders 
the senior lenders include bank of america the lead bank and administrative agent  pnc bank  national association  and wells fargo bank  national association 
debt issuance costs relating to the new us credit agreement were recorded in other assets and are being amortized over the life of the credit facilities 
such unamortized debt issuance costs amounted to  at july  borrowings under the new us credit agreement bear interest at rates ranging from to above the lender s base rate  or at rates ranging from to above the london interbank offered rate libor  depending upon the company s consolidated leverage ratio  which is defined as the consolidated ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and as further adjusted under the terms of the new us credit agreement consolidated ebitda 
at september   the lender s base rate was and the libor rates ranged from to 
the margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings were above the lender s base rate or above libor 
all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at september  the new us credit agreement also provides for fees on the unused portion of our facilities at rates ranging from to  depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio  such rate was at september  in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements in february in which we agree to exchange our variable interest cash flows with fixed interest cash flows provided by one of our existing senior lenders 
with respect to our term loan facility  the interest rate swap is for the period beginning august  and ending july   initially covering  of borrowings based on one month libor and thereafter reducing in quarterly  increments consistent with the mandatory repayment schedule  and the fixed interest cash flow is at a one month libor rate of 
with respect to our revolving credit facility  the interest rate swap is for the period beginning august  and ending january   initially covering  of borrowings based on one month libor and thereafter reducing semi annually by increments of  and the fixed interest cash flow is at a one month libor rate of 
the principal amounts of the term loan facility are to be paid in twenty consecutive quarterly installments of  each beginning on september  the new us credit agreement permits us to make optional prepayments of loans at any time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage fees 
we are required to make mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding under the new us credit agreement of i of the net proceeds received from certain sales or other dispositions of all or any part of the company and its subsidiaries assets  ii of certain insurance and condemnation proceeds received by the company or any of its subsidiaries  iii subject to certain exceptions  of the net cash proceeds received by the company or any of its subsidiaries from the issuance or occurrence of any indebtedness of the company or any of its subsidiaries  and iv subject to certain exceptions  of the net proceeds of the sale of certain equity 
the new us credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants reasonably customary for similar credit facilities and is secured by i substantially all assets of cantel and its united states based subsidiaries including medivators  mar cor  crosstex  and strong dental products  inc strong dental and ii a pledge by cantel of all of the outstanding shares of medivators  mar cor  crosstex and strong dental owned by cantel and of the outstanding shares of cantel s foreign based subsidiaries 
we are in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the new us credit agreement 
at july   we had  of outstanding borrowings under the new us credit agreement  which consisted of  and  under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  respectively  and  was available to be borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
subsequent to july   we repaid  under the revolving credit facility and  under the term loan facility resulting in total outstanding borrowings of  at september  operating leases minimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities  warehouses  office space and equipment 
rent expense related to operating leases for fiscal was recorded on a straight line basis and aggregated  compared with  and  for fiscals and  respectively 
acquisitions payable in connection with the byrne acquisition  we estimated  at july  as the fair value of contingent consideration payable over two years based on the achievement by the acquired business of certain targeted amounts of gross profit 
in addition  we agreed that if the aggregate value of the  of cantel common stock issued as part of the consideration used to acquire the byrne medical business is less than  on july   we will pay to bmi in cash or stock at our option an amount equal to the difference between  and the then value of the shares based on the closing price of cantel common stock on the nyse on july   subject to certain conditions and limitations 
accordingly  at july   we have estimated  as the fair value of this payable  as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
compensation agreements we have previously entered into various severance contracts with executives of the company  including our corporate executive officers and our subsidiary chief executive officers  that defined certain compensation arrangements relating to various employment termination scenarios 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the byrne medical business on august   we entered into a three year employment agreement with an executive officer of the acquired business 
deferred compensation and other deferred compensation and other includes deferred compensation arrangements for certain former medivators directors and officers and is recorded in other long term liabilities 
additionally  deferred compensation and other includes minimal commitments under noncancelable capital leases and purchase commitments of inventory 
convertible note receivable in february  we invested an initial  in a senior subordinated convertible promissory note issued by biosafe  in connection with biosafe s grant to us of certain exclusive and non exclusive license rights to biosafe s antimicrobial additive 
biosafe is the owner of a patented and proprietary antimicrobial agent that is built into the manufacturing of end products to achieve long lasting microbial protection on such end products surface 
as a result of biosafe s successful raising of a minimum incremental amount of cash following our investment  we invested an additional  in notes of biosafe in january bringing the aggregate investment in biosafe notes to  as obligated under our agreement with biosafe 
we are not obligated to invest any additional funds 
the maturity date of the notes  originally june   and extended through an amendment to the notes in june to december   was further extended through an amendment to the notes in december to december  maturity date 
as amended  the interest rate of the notes is per annum through june  and is per annum thereafter 
the entire principal amount and accrued interest are automatically payable in a newly created series of preferred stock issued upon the closing of biosafe s next round financing on or before the maturity date next round financing based on a conversion formula 
if the next round financing fails to occur by the maturity date  the notes  both principal and interest  will be payable in cash and the automatic conversion will no longer apply 
additionally  during the day period following the maturity date  we may elect to convert the principal and all accrued interest into shares of common stock of biosafe at a price per share equal to of the fair market value the discount rate 
the discount rate  originally was reduced to in connection with the initial amendment of the notes and further reduced to in connection with the second amendment of the notes 
no further interest will accrue if we make such election 
as of september   the next round financing has not occurred 
in connection with our investment  we entered into a license agreement with biosafe under which we will pay biosafe a fixed royalty percentage of sales of our products containing biosafe s antimicrobial formulation 
this investment  together with the accrued interest  is included within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets at july  at january   we evaluated this investment for potential impairment and determined that repayment of the notes and accrued interest was unlikely primarily due to biosafe s inability to obtain the next round financing and our assessment of biosafe s going concern 
accordingly  we deemed the investment  together with accrued interest of  fully impaired and recorded a loss of  during our second quarter of fiscal  which was recorded as other expense and a reduction in other assets in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  due to the inability to currently deduct a capital loss and the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future  a tax benefit was not recognized on the loss relating to the impairment of this investment 
financing needs although most of our operating segments generate significant cash from operations  our endoscopy  healthcare disposables  dialysis and water purification and filtration segments are the largest generators of cash 
at july   we had a cash balance of  of which  was held by foreign subsidiaries 
such foreign cash is needed by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes and is unavailable for repatriation 
we believe that our current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations and the funds available under our new us credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations  particularly given that we historically have not needed to borrow for working capital purposes 
at september    was available under our new us credit agreement 
in addition  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent  the company may from time to time increase the new us credit agreement by an aggregate amount not to exceed  without the consent of the lenders 
foreign currency the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
additionally  changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
changes in the value of the euro  british pound and singapore dollar against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts  accounts receivable and liabilities of our subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in euros  british pounds or singapore dollars but must be converted into their functional currency 
furthermore  the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the united states dollar 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of i the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  ii the euro relative to the united states dollar  iii the british pound relative to the united states dollar and iv the singapore dollar relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies  we enter into short term contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros  british pounds and singapore dollars forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there were three foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of  at september   which cover certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
such contracts expired on september  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our subsidiaries that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than their functional currencies 
gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy canadian dollars  euros  british pounds and singapore dollars forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
in fiscal  such forward contracts substantially offset the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar in fiscal  compared with fiscal  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of our balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounted for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an insignificant impact upon our net income in fiscal compared with fiscal for purposes of translating the balance sheet at july  compared with july   the total of the foreign currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of  net of tax  for fiscal  thereby decreasing stockholders equity 
inflation although overall inflation did not have a significant effect on our business  an increase in commodity prices can adversely affect our gross margins 
specifically  our businesses can be adversely impacted by rising fuel and oil prices and are heavily reliant on certain raw materials  such as chemicals  paper  resin  stainless steel and plastic components 
from time to time  we experience price increases for raw materials 
if we are unable to implement price increases to our customers  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we continually evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to endoscopy  dialysis  therapeutic  specialty packaging and chemistries products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when our distribution fleet is utilized except for one large customer in dialysis whereby all products are shipped fob destination 
with respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
with respect to a portion of water purification and filtration product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered  or post delivery obligations such as installation has been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
a portion of our endoscopy  water purification and filtration and dialysis sales are recognized as multiple element arrangements  whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment and installation components based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and installation sold as stand alone components 
if vendor specific objective evidence of selling price is not available  we allocate revenue to the elements of the bundled arrangement using the estimated selling price method in order to qualify the components as separate units of accounting 
revenue on the equipment component is recognized as the equipment is shipped to customers and title passes 
revenue on the installation component is recognized when the installation is complete 
a portion of our healthcare disposables sales relating to the mail in spore test kit is recorded as deferred revenue when initially sold 
we recognize the revenue on these test kits using an estimate based on historical experience of the amount of time that elapses from the point of sale to when the kit is returned to us and we communicate to the customer the results of the required laboratory test 
the related cost of the kits is recorded in inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the revenue is earned 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
with respect to certain service contracts in our endoscopy and water purification and filtration operating segments  service revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of our sales contain right of return provisions 
customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our sales of dialysis  healthcare disposable and water purification and filtration products and certain prepaid packaging products 
we do not offer price protection  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products 
with respect to certain of our dialysis  healthcare disposables  water purification and filtration and endoscopy customers  rebates are provided  such rebates  which consist primarily of volume rebates  are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
the increase in rebates in fiscal is primarily due to increased sales volume in our endoscopy segment 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate periods 
if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of therapeutic filtration products and healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors  water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly and through third party distributors to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other end users  our endoscopy products and services are sold primarily to distributors internationally and directly to hospitals and other end users in the united states  specialty packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users  and chemistries products and services are sold to medical products and service companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables  reductions in allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  we use historical experience as well as current market information 
with few exceptions  the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of our identifiable intangible assets  including customer relationships  technology  brand names  non compete agreements and patents  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
our management is responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
on july   we adopted accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other  asu  which amends current guidance to allow a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount before proceeding to step one of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test  if necessary 
at july   because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of our water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables segments were unlikely to be less than the carrying value  we did not proceed to step one of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test for those two segments 
we performed step one of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test for endoscopy due to the increase in assets related to the byrne acquisition  dialysis  therapeutic filtration  chemistries due to the decrease in operating income in the dialysis  therapeutic filtration and chemistries segments as more fully explained elsewhere in this md a and specialty packaging due to a change in assumptions used in the prior year projection of future operating results 
in performing a detailed quantitative review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments by using fair value results of the discounted cash flow methodology  as well as the market multiple and comparable transaction methodologies when applicable 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
on july   we adopted asu  intangibles goodwill and other  asu  which further expanded the use of a qualitative assessment to indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
accordingly  in performing our annual review for indefinite lived intangibles  management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of such assets is less than the carrying values  and if necessary  performs a quantitative analysis comparing the current fair value of our indefinite lived intangibles assets to their carrying values 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether expected future non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results and cash flows which management believes to be reasonable  discount rates based on the company s weighted average cost of capital and appropriate benchmark peer companies 
assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales forecasts 
subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment 
although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
at july   the average fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded book value by substantial amounts  except our dialysis and specialty packaging segments  which had average fair values that exceeded book value by approximately and  respectively 
at july   goodwill relating to our dialysis and specialty packaging reporting units were  and  respectively 
we believe the most significant assumptions impacting the impairment assessment of dialysis relate to the projected future operating results and cash flows of this segment  including the impact of the shift from reusable to single use dialyzers as more fully explained elsewhere in this md a and in risk factors 
we believe the most significant assumptions impacting the impairment assessment of specialty packaging relate to an assumed compounded annual sales growth of and future operating efficiencies included in our projections of future operating results and cash flows of this segment  which forecasts are in excess of historical run rates 
if future operating results and cash flows are substantially less than our projections  future impairment charges may be recorded 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected non discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
our historical assessments of our long lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized 
however  the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective 
on july   management concluded that no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  with the exception of the impairment of our biosafe investment as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
warranties we provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of our products have a one year warranty 
we record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and stock awards in which stock compensation expense is recognized for any option or stock award grant based upon the award s fair value 
all of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted stock are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications to existing awards  accelerated vesting related to certain employment terminations and assumptions used in determining fair value  expected lives and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which historically has been and is now approximately as we began paying dividends in january  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to pending and threatened legal actions 
it is our policy to accrue for amounts related to these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount of anticipated exposure can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that any of these pending claims or legal actions will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions as well as net operating loss carryforwards 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets  as adjusted for valuation allowances  will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
a review of our deferred tax items considers known future changes in various income tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the income tax rate were to change in the future  particularly in the united states and to a lesser extent canada  our items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations 
unrecognized tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the related liability 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we determine fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
certain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature 
we reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include contingent consideration  certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries  as well as reserves for accounts receivable  inventories and warranties 
we account for contingent consideration relating to business combinations that occurred subsequent to july  in accordance with asc  business combinations  which requires us to record the fair value of contingent consideration as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re measure the liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our consolidated statements of income 
we determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios and weight the probability of these outcomes 
similarly  other components of an acquisition s purchase price can be required to be recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition and continually re measured at each balance sheet date  such as the three year price floor relating to the byrne acquisition which fair value was determined using a option valuation model  as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the ultimate settlement of liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities we recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as costs to terminate a contract  the exit or disposal of a business  or the early termination of a leased property  by recognizing the liability at fair value when incurred  except for certain one time termination benefits  such as severance costs  for which the period of recognition begins when a severance plan is communicated to employees 
inherent in the calculation of liabilities relating to exit and disposal activities are significant management judgments and estimates  including estimates of termination costs  employee attrition and the interest rate used to discount certain expected net cash payments 
such judgments and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis 
the cumulative effect of a change to a liability resulting from a revision to either timing or the amount of estimated cash flows is recognized by us as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
other matters we do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements  other than future commitments under operating leases and executive severance and license agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and market risk a portion of our products in all of our business segments are exported to and imported from a variety of geographic locations  and our business could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting all of such geographies including but not limited to the united states  canada  the european union  the united kingdom and the far east 
a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
the businesses of our canadian subsidiaries could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar also affect our results of operations because certain net assets of our canadian subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into their functional currency 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar had an insignificant impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our net income and had an adverse impact upon stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
changes in the value of the euro  british pound and singapore dollar against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts  accounts receivable and liabilities of our subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in euros  british pounds or singapore dollars but must be converted into their functional currency 
furthermore  the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and the euro  british pound and singapore dollar did not have a significant overall impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our net income and stockholders equity 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of i the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  ii the euro relative to the united states dollar  iii the british pound relative to the united states dollar and iv the singapore dollar relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies  we enter into short term contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros  british pounds and singapore dollars forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedge instruments 
there were three foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of  at july   which covered certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
such contracts expired on august  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our subsidiaries that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than their functional currencies 
in fiscal  such forward contracts substantially offset the impact on operations relating to certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
the functional currency of medivators japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar in fiscal  compared with fiscal  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounted for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an insignificant impact on our net income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  and an adverse impact upon stockholders equity primarily due to the decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar during fiscal interest rate market risk we have united states credit facilities for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings are under libor contracts 
therefore  interest expense is affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states as well as libor interest rates 
additionally  we amended our credit facilities on august   as described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
due to current market conditions  the modification of our credit facilities resulted in an increase of our margins above the lender s base rate and libor  which will adversely affect our results of operations in the future since the level of outstanding borrowings have increased significantly due to the byrne medical business acquisition on august  in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements in february in which we agree to exchange our variable interest cash flows with fixed interest cash flows provided by one of our existing senior lenders 
with respect to our term loan facility  the interest rate swap is for the period beginning august  and ending july   initially covering  of borrowings based on one month libor and thereafter reducing in quarterly  increments consistent with the mandatory repayment schedule  and the fixed interest cash flow is at a one month libor rate of 
with respect to our revolving credit facility  the interest rate swap is for the period beginning august  and ending january   initially covering  of borrowings based on one month libor and thereafter reducing semi annually by increments of  and the fixed interest cash flow is at a one month libor rate of 
therefore  we are substantially protected from exposure associated with increasing libor rates in future years 
market risk sensitive transactions we are exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  our outstanding debt is under our new us credit facility  described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such credit facility consists of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally under libor contracts ranging from one to twelve months 
therefore  our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
as a result of entering into forward starting interest rate swap agreements  our interest rate exposure is limited to the outstanding portion of our revolving credit facility in excess of  based on our outstanding revolving credit facility balance of  at september   a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would result in incremental annual interest expense of  however  we also maintain a cash balance of  at july  which is maintained in cash or invested in low return cash equivalents such as united states money market funds with leading banking institutions 
an increase in interest rates would generate additional interest income  which would partially offset the adverse impact of additional interest expense 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  we are principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and singapore dollar as these currencies relate to the united states dollar 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
our canadian subsidiaries and singapore subsidiary have net assets in currencies other than their functional currencies  which must be converted into functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
similarly  our united states subsidiaries have net assets in currencies other than their functional united states currency  which must be converted into functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
therefore  our canadian subsidiaries  singapore subsidiary and united states subsidiaries are exposed to risk if the value of the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and singapore dollar appreciates relative to the united states dollar 
for fiscals and  a uniform increase in the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and singapore dollar relative to the united states dollar would have resulted in aggregate realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively 
however  since certain of our subsidiaries use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the impact of fluctuations of the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and singapore dollar relative to the united states dollar  realized losses relating to the fluctuation of those currencies would be partially offset by gains on the foreign currency forward contracts 
in addition to the above  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our financial statements 
for fiscals and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  due to the translation of the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries adverse changes would be caused by appreciation of either the canadian dollar or the euro relative to the united states dollar 
however  such a change in foreign currency rates would have resulted in an unrealized gain on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries of  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
such an unrealized gain would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our stockholders equity 
conversely  if the canadian dollar and the euro depreciated by relative to the united states dollar  we would have recognized realized gains after tax of approximately  and  in fiscals and  respectively  and an unrealized loss of  and  in fiscals and  respectively  on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since we view these investments as long term  we would not expect such unrealized losses to be realized in the near term 
the aggregate adverse impact  net of tax  to our results of operations of a uniform increase in foreign currency exchange rates  as described above  due to both financial statement translation and functional currency conversion would have been  and  for fiscals and  respectively  partially offset by the effect of our foreign currency forward contracts
