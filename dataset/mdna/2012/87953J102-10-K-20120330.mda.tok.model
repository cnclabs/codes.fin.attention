in  our revenues and net income decreased by and  respectively  compared to our rf traditional products remained our main product category in and accounted for of revenues 
we launched our wfds platform in  and the platform started to generate revenue in in  we completed wfds installations  and wfds contributed of our revenues for the year 
our wfds platform enables telestone to diversify its customer base through the addition of non telecom customers such as property owners and managers 
significant accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates for the year ended december  compared to those discussed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition net sales of equipment represent the contracted value of goods  net of value added tax vat and returns 
the company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery occurs  equipment is received and accepted by the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
service revenue is recognized when the service is performed and accepted by the customer 
the company has a policy of including handling costs incurred for finished goods  which are not significant  in the sales and marketing expenses 
the company provides installation services for certain sales of equipment under fixed price contracts 
revenues from these fixed price service contracts are recognized on the completed contract method 
under the completed contract method  revenue and costs of individual contracts are included in operations in the year during which they are completed 
losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are recognized in the period such losses are determined 
this method is used because the contract is completed within a short period of time  and the financial position and results of operations do not vary significantly from those that would result from using the percentage of completion method 
a contract is considered completed upon completion of all essential contract work and the installation has been accepted by the customer 
inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
potential losses from obsolete and slow moving inventories are provided for when identified 
goodwill goodwill on acquisition of businesses  being the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the company s share of the fair value of the identifiable assets  liabilities and contingent liabilities  is recognized as a separate asset 
goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses  which is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment test and determination of gain or loss on disposal 
an impairment loss on goodwill is not reversed 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets the long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes 
determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed to customers 
the company recognizes an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade and other receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
the company s estimate is based on a variety of factors  including historical collection experience  existing economic conditions and a review of the current status of the receivable 
accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of us  and us  as of december  and respectively 
results of operations our operating results are presented on a consolidated basis for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the fiscal year ended december  for the years ended december  and  a tabular summary of results of operations is as follows comparisons item of revenue of revenue revenue    equipment and services costs   gross profit   sales and marketing expenses   general and administrative expenses   research and development expenses   depreciation and amortization interest expenses  other income  net net income before income tax   income tax    net income    we derive our revenues primarily from capital expenditures made by prc telecommunications carriers 
our operating revenues are composed of sales of wireless equipment and sales of services such as systems integration  engineering services  technical support  wireless network optimization and network maintenance 
our consolidated net income decreased by from  in to  in the net profit ratio was in  compared to in most of the figures related to income experienced a similar decrease as compared to our gross profit ratio remained stable in and for the year ended december   revenue was  gross profit was  net income was  and the net profit ratio was 
most of these figures represented a decrease as compared to these decreases can be partially attributed to the decreased income and increased provision for doubtful accounts receivable in revenue years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  growth item of revenue of revenue product sales   service sales    total    and revenues generated from product sales and professional services were at a similar level  but comparably more revenue was generated from the provision of professional services in breakdown by customer years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  growth item of revenue of revenue china mobile   china unicom    china telecom    others   overseas total    the company s major sources of revenue were china mobile and china unicom 
for the year ended december  our revenue generated from china mobile and china unicom accounted for and of our total revenue  respectively  compared to and in there was a slight decrease in the proportion of revenues generated from the big three 
the proportion of revenue generated from other customers increased significantly 
the revenue from new customers other than the big three was the main reason for the increase in revenue from other customers 
the revenues generated from overseas customers still remained at a relatively small portion of our total revenue 
in  big three reduced their investment in g as they plan to intense their investment on g starting we expect our revenues to grow in due to our previous research and development in g 
breakdown by type of technology years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  growth item of revenue of revenue wfds   traditional products   total    for the year ended december   the revenue of our wfds product was  contributing of the total revenues and representing a decrease of as compared to the same period of since traditional products have a rather long receivables turnover period  in the company has put great effort on the r d and marketing of new products such as wfds and tips 
gross profit for years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  growth item of revenue of revenue revenue    equipment and services costs   gross profit   gross profit ratio for the year ended december   our gross profit ratio was  as compared to in the same period of operating expenses years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  growth item of revenue of revenue sales and marketing expenses   general and administrative expenses   research and development expenses   depreciation and amortization total    sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were  or of our revenue for the year ended december   as compared to  or of our revenue for the same period in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was mainly due to the decrease in revenue and the slowdown in spending following the high growth period in the past two years 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were  or of our revenue  as compared to  or of our revenue for the same period in the increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the provision for doubtful accounts receivable of  in  compared to  in  and the increase in office rental expenses after the relocation of our office in late the increase was partly offset by the decrease in share based compensation to directors and employee of  research and development expenses research and development expenses were  or of total revenue for the year ended december   as compared to  or of revenue for the same period in the proportion of r d expenses remained at a relatively low level 
the increase in research and development expenses was mainly due to our r d for new products such as wfds and tips 
interest expenses years ended december  and item year ended december  year ended december  growth of revenue of revenue interest expenses  interest expenses interest expense for was  an increase of  or  from  in the increase in interest expenses in was primarily due to more interest and guarantee fees paid for our short term bank loans 
the company s short term loans totaled  as of december   as compared to  as of december   an increase of 
liquidity and capital resources we generally finance our operations from cash flow generated internally and short term bank loans 
as of december   we had current assets of  our current assets were comprised of inventory of  accounts receivable of  prepayments of  other current assets of  cash and cash equivalents of  and amounts due from related parties of  current liabilities were  comprised of accounts payable of  tax payables of  short term bank loans of  customer deposits for sales of equipment of  amounts due to related parties of  services cost payable of  and other payables and accruals of  our net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  as of december   cash was  current assets were  and current liabilities were  reflecting a current ratio current assets current liabilities of we grant credit to our customers for both products and services sales 
our accounts receivable turnover period for the year ended december  was days 
we have experienced a fairly long receivables turnover period due to a rapid growth sales strategy in  especially in the second half of  and most of those sales were not yet settled in we experience a longer accounts receivable turnover period than some of our competitors 
this is mainly due to two factors implementation of most of our projects are integrated and project payment is determined by achieving certain milestones in the engineering stage  whereas most of our competitors focus on equipment sales 
the traditionally long payment periods from china s state controlled telecom carriers 
annual inventory turnover days in was days as compared to days in the company s cash is primarily in renminbi and united states dollars  with short term loans in renminbi and revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities in both renmibi and united states dollars 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our long credit period arises because our major customers are the three major players in the chinese telecom market china mobile  china unicom and china telecom 
due to their virtual monopoly in china s telecom market  we are at a disadvantage in negotiations regarding payments and credit periods 
however the big telecom carriers are state owned and recognized as blue chip customers 
the big china telecom carriers are our major customers  and of the revenues of came from them 
thus our accounts receivable are a function of our business model 
once a contract is signed  we receive of the contract value within months  another in months  and the remainder in months 
as of december   our accounts receivable was  whereas as of december   our accounts receivable was we have made attempts to adequately address accounts receivable turnover problems and have made efforts to shorten the collection period 
our wfds projects generally have about dsos  since they follow a different business model and serve a different customer base 
as wfds increases as a percentage of total revenues  we expect our dsos to fall 
major milestones in tips telestone intelligence premises system research and development has made breakthroughs tips telestone intelligence premises system is a groundbreaking technology based on telestone s wireless fiber optic distribution system wfds tm technology 
the core of tips is telestone s unified premises information network system upins technology  which distributes all information generated or required at any time and at any location within a premises network in a timely manner 
tips networks are characterized by ultra wide bandwidth  long transmission distances  and multi cascading technology 
so far we have completed tips theoretical research and its key technology development 
also  tips has been used in a few pilot projects of ours  some of which have already been completed  such as administrative committee of z park and wuxi new area administrative office building 
beijing shanghai high speed rail project in january  a high standard  large capacity  modern high speed passenger rail line from beijing shanghai installed a wfds enabled unified access network uan solution and the corresponding proprietary equipment to satisfy the advanced communication needs of all three carriers subscribers china mobile  china unicom  and china telecom for wireless broad band internet access  as well as g and g wireless cellular coverage 
our subsidiary  beijing telestone technology co  ltd  carried out the research and development of technology and building multiple networks in order to achieve the complete reunification of the bearer transmission and thereby perfectly formed an integrated service model for complete coverage of multi service networks 
houston hospital project multi carrier wireless business and sharing in august  quell corporation  who won the contract after successfully demonstrating telestone s wfds tm functionality to the houston hospital  which provided a challenging installation site where cellular connections are weak or overloaded in the outdoor environment and thus have further reduced signal strength in indoor settings 
this installation of wfds tm has had a good track record and has made believers out of those utilizing the technology 
wfds technology enters international market in august  we signed our first wfds agreement in the us market to install a wfds solution at the memorial hermann hospital headquarters in houston  texas  which subsequently was successfully completed 
it can support multiple carriers system for sharing  g mobile and unified coverage of data network 
in and we plan to continue to cooperate with t mobile and hospital owners to provide similar installations 
this successful deployment represents a major milestone for telestone in marketing its technology in international markets 
we believe that the success of the project and the high level of customer satisfaction can help us expand in additional north american and south american markets 
it is also significant that this project was deployed for a non carrier customer  which diversifies telestone s customer base from its traditional telecom carrier customers 
we have also made some progress with pilot projects in mexico  chili and columbia

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contingent liabilities we recognize our revenue upon the completion of contracts and have made full tax provision in accordance with relevant national and local laws and regulations of the prc 
a contract is considered completed upon completion of all essential contract work and when installation has been accepted by the customer 
it is the common practice in the prc that invoices are not issued to customers until payments are received 
we follow the practice of reporting our revenue for prc tax purposes when invoices are issued 
all unbilled revenue will become taxable when invoices are issued 
despite the fact that we have made full tax provision in our financial statements  we may be subject to surcharge and penalty for the deferred reporting of tax obligations
