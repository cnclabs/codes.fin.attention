under the terms of the agreement  we transferred manufacturing assets and related liabilities valued at million to lfoundry in return for nominal cash consideration 
in connection with the sale  we entered into certain other ancillary agreements  including the msa under which we agreed to purchase wafers from lfoundry s affiliate  lfoundry rousset  for four years following the closing on a 
table of contents take or pay basis 
upon closing of this transaction  we recorded a loss on sale of million in  which is summarized in the following table in thousands net assets transferred fair value of manufacturing services agreement currency translation adjustment severance cost liability transition services selling costs other related costs loss on sale of assets our take or pay obligations under the msa are limited to specified monthly periods based on rolling forecasts we provide to lfoundry rousset 
we purchased all the wafers available to us under the msa in each of and as future wafer purchases under the msa were negotiated at pricing above their fair value  we recorded a liability in conjunction with the sale  representing the present value of the unfavorable purchase commitment 
to determine the liability  we obtained current market prices for wafers from unaffiliated  well known third party foundries  taking into consideration minimum volume requirements as specified in the contract  process technology  industry pricing trends and other factors 
we determined that the difference between the contract prices and market prices over the term of the agreement totaled million 
the present value of this liability totaled million discount rate of and is included in the loss on sale of assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
the gross value of the msa is recognized as a credit to cost of revenues over the term of the msa as the wafers are purchased and the present value discount of million is recognized as interest expense over the same term 
we recorded a credit to cost of revenues of million and million relating to the msa in the years ended december  and  respectively  and million and million in interest expense relating to the msa in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the sale of our rousset manufacturing operations resulted in the substantial liquidation of our investment in our european manufacturing facilities  and accordingly  we recorded a gain of million related to cta balance that was previously recorded within stockholders equity  as we concluded  based on the relevant accounting guidance  that we should similarly release all remaining related currency translation adjustments 
as part of the sale  we agreed to reimburse lfoundry for severance costs expected to be incurred subsequent to the sale 
we entered into an escrow agreement in which we agreed to remit funds to lfoundry for the required benefits and payments to those employees who are determined to be part of an approved departure plan 
we paid million for severance amounts payable under the arrangement in the fourth quarter of as part of the sale of the manufacturing operations  we incurred million in software hardware and consulting costs to set up a separate  independent it infrastructure for lfoundry 
these costs were incurred based on negotiation with lfoundry  provided no benefit to us  and would not have been incurred if we were not selling the manufacturing operations 
therefore  the direct and incremental costs associated with these services were recorded as part of the loss on sale 
we also incurred other costs related to the sale of million  which included performance based bonuses of million for certain employees no executive officers were included  related to the completion of the sale of the rousset manufacturing operations to lfoundry 

table of contents we also incurred direct and incremental selling costs of million  which represented broker commissions and legal fees associated with the sale of our rousset manufacturing operations to lfoundry 
asset impairment charges we assess the recoverability of long lived assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
we measure the amount of impairment of such long lived assets by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  which is generally determined based on projected discounted future cash flows or appraised values 
we classify long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until they are disposed  including assets not available for immediate sale in their present condition 
we report assets and liabilities to be disposed of by sale as held for sale and recognize those assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated 
property and equipment previously included in the disposal group and reclassified to held and used in december totaled million 
in connection with this reclassification  we assessed the fair value of the property and the equipment to be retained and concluded that the fair value of the property was lower than its carrying value less depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the asset disposal group been continuously classified as held and used 
as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of no impairment charge was recorded for the equipment that was reclassified to held and used but the depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the disposal group been continuously classified as held and used  which totaled million  was included in operating results in fourth quarter of for the year ended december   following further negotiation with lfoundry  we determined that certain assets should instead remain with us 
as a result  we reclassified property and equipment to held and used in the quarter ended june  in connection with this reclassification  we assessed the fair value of these assets to be retained and concluded that the fair value of the assets was lower than their carrying value less depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used

the decrease in foreign exchange transaction gains for the year ended december  was primarily due to changes to our foreign exchange exposures from intercompany balances between our subsidiaries compared to the year ended december  we continue to have balance sheet exposures in foreign currencies subject to exchange rate fluctuations and may incur further gains or losses in the future 
included in interest expense for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively  of interest expense related to our manufacturing services agreement with lfoundry rousset 
provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a provision for benefit from income taxes of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant components of the tax expenses for the year ended december  were from operations in jurisdictions with operating profits 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  is lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 
for  our tax provision was lower than it otherwise would have been due to revenue recognized in lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result of a global tax restructuring implemented on january  for the year ended december   the significant components of the tax benefit were the favorable settlement of the irs tax audit  the release of valuation allowances attributable to deferred tax assets  and the recognition of certain us foreign tax credits and foreign r d credits 
for the year ended december   the significant components of the tax benefit were benefits of million due to the recognition of refundable foreign r d credits that related to prior years 
the refundability of these credits does not depend on the existence of taxable income or a tax liability and the credits were not previously recognized due to uncertainty over the realization of these credits 
the credits were realized during these years as the income tax audits were completed or the statutes of limitations for the credits expired 
similar to our position during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  except certain assets related to state net operating losses and state tax credits  including r d

also included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december   and  are million  million and million  respectively  of tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in adjustments to other tax accounts  primarily deferred tax assets 
in the year ended december   the french tax authority completed its examination of tax years through for one of our french subsidiaries 
the examination for these years resulted in a tax benefit of million  related to the release of previously accrued tax reserves 
currently  we have tax audits in progress in various other foreign jurisdictions 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
while we believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  the outcome is subject to uncertainty 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  our current asset to liability ratio  calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities  was at december   compared to at december  working capital  calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   of the million aggregate cash and cash equivalents held by us  the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was million 
if the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed for our operations in the united states  the repatriation of some of these funds could give rise to tax exposure 
however  we believe that  with certain exceptions  earnings that have been permanently reinvested prior to december  continue to be permanently reinvested 
further  our current liquidity position and business plan do not demonstrate a need to repatriate foreign held funds for our us operations to the extent the remittance of such funds would give rise to tax exposure 

table of contents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was determined primarily by adjusting net income of million for certain non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation charges of million  and million related to the non cash portion of the gain on sale related to our sale of our san jose  california headquarters 
in addition  operating cash flows were reduced by inventory build during the year of million as a result of higher build rates to support increased revenue  due to our transition to foundry suppliers with minimum delivery requirements and a decline in shipments in the second half of net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased primarily due to improved operating results and adjusting net income of million to exclude the non cash benefit relating to the release of tax accruals and reserves for certain deferred tax assets of million  offset by adjustment for certain non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation charges of million  and million related to the non cash portion of loss on sale related to the sale of our rousset  france manufacturing operations and our sms business 
in addition  operating cash flows were reduced by inventory build during the year of million and a trade accounts receivable increase of million 
accounts receivable decreased by or million to million at december   from million at december  the average days of accounts receivable outstanding increased to days for the three months ended december  from days for the three months ended december  the decrease in receivable balances is related to lower shipments during the year 
inventories increased during  using million of operating cash flows for the year ended december  to build inventory  compared to an increase in inventories resulting in million of operating cash flows for the year ended december  our days of inventory increased to days for the three months ended december  from days for the three months ended december  inventory levels increased during the year as we continued to build for expected demand 
inventories consist of raw wafers  purchased foundry wafers  work in process and finished units 
we expect inventory levels to decline throughout as builds are adjusted and as demand recovers during for the year ended december   we made cash payments of million to former quantum employees in connection with contingent employment arrangements resulting from the quantum acquisition in no further payments were made to former employees of qrg in nor any further payments due in connection with that acquisition 
we also received cash payments of million related to litigation related insurance settlements that were recorded as a reduction of operating expenses for the year ended december  investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we paid million for acquisitions of fixed assets  million for intangible assets and million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of add  offset in part by net proceeds of million from the sale of our san jose  california headquarters

we utilized million in cash to repurchase million shares of our common stock in  following the authorization by our board of directors in august to repurchase common stock 
we believe our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  available equipment lease financing  and other short term and medium term bank borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements over the next twelve months 
since a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through our foreign subsidiaries  our cash flow  ability to service debt  and payments to vendors are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to us 
our foreign subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and may be subject to local legal or tax requirements  or other restrictions that may limit their ability to transfer funds to other group entities including the us parent entity  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
during the next twelve months  we expect our operations to continue to generate positive cash flow 
however  a portion of cash balances may be used to make capital expenditures  repurchase common stock  or make acquisitions 
remaining debt obligations totaled million at december  we made million in cash payments for capital equipment in  and we expect total cash payments for capital expenditures in to be relatively consistent with  depending on business levels 
we paid million in restructuring payments  primarily for employee severance in during and in future years  our ability to make necessary capital investments or strategic acquisitions will depend on our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and on our ability to obtain adequate financing if necessary 
we believe we have sufficient working capital to fund operations with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  together with expected future cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations totaled million for the year ended december  on march   we entered into a five year asset backed credit facility for up to million reduced to million on november  with certain european lenders

defined benefit pension plans we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our french and german employees 
plan benefits are provided in accordance with local statutory requirements 
benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels 
the plans are non funded  except as pension payments to beneficiaries become due 
pension liabilities and charges to expense are based upon various assumptions  updated quarterly  including discount rates  future salary increases  employee turnover  and mortality rates 
retirement plans consist of two types of plans 
our first plan type covers our french 
table of contents employees and provides for termination benefits paid to employees only at retirement  and consists of approximately one to five months of salary 
our second plan type covers our german employees and provides for defined benefit payouts for the remaining employee s post retirement life 
pension benefits payable under these plans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash funding for benefits to be paid for in is expected to be approximately million and an additional million thereafter over the next years 
off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies  which we review annually to determine if they should be accounted for as variable interest entities 
for the year ended december   we evaluated our investments in these privately held companies and concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest from investment entities 
as a result  we account for these investments on a cost basis and do not consolidate the activity of these investee entities 
certain events can require a reassessment of our investments in privately held companies to determine if they meet the criteria for variable interest entities and to determine which stakeholders in such entities will be the primary beneficiary 
in the event of a reassessment  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities in future periods 
during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either our subsidiaries or us 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately million 
we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
intangibles goodwill and other asc topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the amendments from this update will simplify how entities  both public and non public  test for goodwill impairment 
the amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  as described in the accounting literature 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any  as described in the accounting literature 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of the update to asc topic is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
our adoption of this guidance as of december  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments from this update will result in more converged guidance on how comprehensive income is presented under us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
with this update to asc  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the amendments in this update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income  nor does it affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
current us gaap allows reporting entities three alternatives for presenting other comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
one of those presentation options is to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this update eliminates that option 
the amended guidance also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the amendments in this asu should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  on october  the fasb decided to propose a deferral of the requirement to present reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
the adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement asc topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the amendments in this asu result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under us gaap and ifrs 
consequently  the amendments describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements as well as improving consistency in application across jurisdictions to ensure that us gaap and ifrs fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way 
the asu also provides for certain changes in current gaap disclosure requirements  for example with respect to the measurement of level assets and for measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity 
the amendments in this asu are to be applied prospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we sell our products to oems and distributors and recognize revenue when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
allowances for sales returns and other credits are recorded at the time of sale 
contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
sales terms do not include post shipment obligations except for product warranty  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for sales to certain distributors primarily based in the us and europe with agreements allowing for price protection and product returns  we do not have the ability to estimate future claims at the point of shipment  and given that price is not fixed or determinable at that time  revenue is not recognized until the distributor sells the product to its end customer 
for sales to independent distributors in asia  excluding japan  we invoice these distributors at full list price upon shipment and issue a rebate  or credit  once product has been sold to the end customer and the distributor has met certain reporting requirements 
after reviewing the pricing  rebate and quotation related terms  we concluded that we could reliably estimate future claims  therefore  we recognize revenue at the point of shipment for our asian distributors  assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria are met  utilizing amounts invoiced  less estimated future claims 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenues may result 
we provide for sales returns based on our customer experience and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing specific customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends 
at both december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million 
income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  it is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax 
table of contents planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that may exist and consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
our tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes labor  including stock based compensation costs  materials  depreciation and other overhead costs  as well as factors for estimated production yields and scrap 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize selling prices in our period ending backlog for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value provision is charged to cost of revenues at the point of market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product and other factors  including  but not limited to  competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product lifecycles 
actual demand may be lower  or market conditions less favorable  than those projected by us 
this difference could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin should inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  should actual demand and market conditions be more favorable than those estimated by us  gross margin could be favorably impacted 
we provide for inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
increases to the provision for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenues 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  it will result in lower costs and higher gross margin for those products 
fixed assets we review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that 
table of contents demonstrated continuing losses associated with an asset  iv significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value  v recent changes in our manufacturing model  and vi management s assessment of future manufacturing capacity requirements 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions  which require our judgment  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  we must use our judgment in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
we estimate the useful life of our manufacturing equipment  which is the largest component of our fixed assets  to be five years 
we base our estimate on our experience with acquiring  using and disposing of equipment over time 
depreciation expense is a major element of our manufacturing cost structure 
we begin depreciation on new equipment when it is put into use for production 
the aggregate amount of fixed assets under construction for which depreciation was not being recorded was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we early adopted asu intangibles goodwill and other and performed a step  or qualitative assessment of its goodwill balance  which required management to make certain judgments and estimates 
based on our assessment of the carrying amount of reporting units compared to the fair value of reporting units as of the assessment date and due to current economic factors  we did not proceed to step purchased intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  which are formed by evaluating operating plans 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments 
the assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation we determine the fair value of options on the measurement date utilizing an option pricing model  which is affected by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors during the expected period between the stock option vesting date and the stock option exercise date 
for performance based restricted stock units  we are required to assess the probability of achieving certain financial objectives at the end of each reporting period 
based on the assessment of this probability  which requires subjective judgment  we record stock based compensation expense before the performance criteria are actually fully achieved  which may then be reversed in future periods if we determine that it is 
table of contents no longer probable that the objectives will be achieved 
the expected cost of each award is reflected over the performance period and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of a restricted stock unit is equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the measurement date 
restructuring charges our restructuring accruals include primarily payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases  other contracts and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
accruals are recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
litigation the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we accrue for losses related to litigation if a loss is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether accruals for litigation should be made 
if we were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities whose values are dependent upon short term interest rates 
we generally classify these securities as available for sale  and consequently record them on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded as a separate part of stockholders equity 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
given our current profile of interest rate exposures and the maturities of our investment holdings  we believe that an unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on our investment portfolio or statements of operations through december  we had long term debt and capital leases totaling million at december   which have fixed interest rates 
we do not hedge against the risk of interest rate changes for debt and could be negatively affected should these rates increase significantly 
while there can be no assurance that these rates will remain at current levels  we believe that any rate increase will not cause a significant adverse impact to our results of operations  cash flows or to our financial position 
foreign currency risk when we take an order denominated in a foreign currency we will receive fewer dollars  and lower revenue  than we initially anticipated if that local currency weakens against the dollar before we ship our product 
conversely  revenues will be positively impacted if the local currency strengthens against the dollar before we ship our product 
costs may also be affected by foreign currency fluctuation 
for example  in europe  where we have costs denominated in european currencies  costs will decrease if the local currency weakens 
conversely  all costs will increase if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
the net effect of average exchange rates for the year ended december   compared to the average exchange rates for the year ended december   would have resulted in a decrease to income of operations of million 
this impact is determined assuming that all foreign currency denominated transactions that occurred for the year ended december  were recorded using the average foreign currency exchange rates in the year ended december  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency risk 
changes in foreign exchange rates have historically had a significant effect on our net revenues and operating costs 
net revenues denominated in foreign currencies were  and of our total net 
table of contents revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs denominated in foreign currencies were  and of our total costs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net revenues denominated in euros were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs denominated in euros were  and of our total costs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
average annual exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency revenues and expenses in euros were approximately  and euros to the dollar for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable overall effect on our operating results 
our net revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million lower had the average exchange rate in the current year remained the same as the average rate in effect for the year ended december  in addition  in  our operating expenses would have been approximately million lower relating to cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
the net effect  had average foreign currency rates remained the same during as in  would have been that income from operations would have decreased approximately million in for the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable overall effect on our operating results 
our net revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher had the average exchange rate in the current year remained the same as the average rate in effect for the year ended december  in addition  in  our operating expenses would have been approximately million higher relating to cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
the net effect  had foreign currency rates remained the same during as in  would have been that income from operations would have increased approximately million in we also face the risk that our accounts receivables denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts receivable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
similarly  we face the risk that our accounts payable and debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currency at both december  and approximately and of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and december   respectively 
we have not historically sought to hedge our foreign currency exposure  although we may determine to do so in the future 
liquidity and valuation risk approximately million of our investment portfolio was invested in auction rate securities at both december  and december
