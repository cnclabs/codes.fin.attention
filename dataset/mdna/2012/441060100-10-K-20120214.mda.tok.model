the following provides current updates for each category 
generic pharmaceutical product development in  hospira adopted a new program related to its generic specialty injectable pharmaceutical product line 
this program will be executed over the next several years and will require hospira to qualify certain of its on market products into new countries  and to pursue other on market generic products that are not currently in hospira s portfolio 
also in  hospira changed the methodology for reporting its generic pharmaceutical product pipeline 
the previous pipeline methodology included products that were set to launch in major markets only  and did not capture hospira s opportunity to expand its product offerings in all countries where the products were expected to launch 
as of december   under the new methodology  hospira s generic pharmaceutical pipeline consisted of compounds 
more than half of the overall pipeline consisted of compounds related to oncology and anti infectives  with the remainder focused on cardiovascular  anesthesia and other areas 
for certain of these compounds  hospira is actively pursuing a strategy of challenging the intellectual property of proprietary pharmaceutical companies in an effort to be the first generic to market 
hospira launched new generic injectable pharmaceutical products in  including the following products in the us docetaxel for injection an oncolytic drug used to treat a variety of cancers  topotecan for injection an oncolytic drug used for the treatment of small cell lung cancer  and imipenem cilastatin for injection a beta lactam antibiotic

in addition  celltrion is in the process of completing its program for two of these co developed biosimiliars  infliximab and trastuzumab  and will prepare to submit these development programs to various regulatory health 
table of contents authorities in the fda recently issued three draft guidance documents regarding biosimiliars 
while hospira is in the process of analyzing these guidelines  they appear to be in line with hospira s expectations 
hospira will continue to analyze these guidance documents and any final guidelines that are issued by the fda 
in october  hospira began its phase iii us clinical trial of its biosimilar erythropoietin epo for patients with certain renal dysfunction who have anemia 
as hospira s biosimilar development program progresses  and as hospira continues its phase iii us clinical trial for epo  hospira expects that over the next several years  the amount of spending on the biosimilar program will increase as a percentage of hospira s total research and development r d expense 
proprietary pharmaceutical product development as of december   hospira has in development co development the following proprietary pharmaceutical products precedex tm is a proprietary sedative 
hospira is engaged in the following development programs to expand the clinical use of this product in  hospira completed its clinical program for the long term use of precedex tm greater than hour infusion  and has responded to the complete response letter from the u 
s 
food and drug administration fda it has achieved approval of this indication in certain markets outside the us  in  hospira began clinical trials in its phase iii development for the use of precedex tm in the pediatric setting 
hospira is in the process of completing this program in preparation for submission to the fda  in  hospira began clinical trials in japan in its phase iii development for a procedural sedation indication in the use of precedex tm 
posidur tm is a long acting version of the anesthetic bupivacaine 
in  hospira entered into a licensing agreement with durect corporation to develop and market durect s posidur tm  which was under phase iii development at the time hospira entered into the agreement 
in january  durect announced the top line results from the phase iii clinical study  which did not reach statistical significance 
hospira is working with durect to assess the data and will discuss the results with the fda mid dyloject tm is a post operative pain management drug currently awaiting fda approval 
in  hospira received a complete response letter from the fda regarding dyloject tm 
hospira and its third party manufacturer continue to work closely with the fda to address all items raised as part of the regulatory process  but the timing of resolution is uncertain 
on january   hospira and kiadis pharma bv entered into an agreement that terminates hospira s obligations with respect to atir a personalized hematology product designed for blood cancer patients in need of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation going forward 
the termination agreement contains provisions which allow hospira to collect royalty payments should atir be commercialized in the future 
device product development in  hospira submitted a k application with the fda for modifications to its symbiq tm infusion system 
the fda submitted questions to the k application 
hospira has responded to the first set of questions  and is preparing its response to the second round of questions 
hospira expects to respond by the end of the first quarter of hospira believes this application is one of the first in the industry to be submitted under recent fda draft guidance for k clearances of infusion pumps  which makes it difficult to project the prospects and timeline for fda clearance

risk factors 
certain quality and product related matters hospira s pharmaceutical and device products are subject to extensive  complex and increasing oversight and regulation by the fda and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities 
hospira s manufacturing and other facilities are subject to periodic inspections to verify compliance with current fda and other governmental regulatory requirements 
this regulatory oversight may lead to inspection observations commonly called form observations in the us  warning letters  consent decrees  voluntary or involuntary product recalls  injunctions to halt production and distribution of products  monetary sanctions  delays in product approvals and other restrictions on operations 
any of these regulatory enforcement actions as well as hospira s inspections  reviews and commitments may require remediation activities with respect to products  production facilities and quality production policies  procedures and processes 
the following information provides additional detail regarding certain quality and product related matters 
warning letter in april  hospira received a warning letter from the fda the fda s warning letter is publicly available on the fda s website in connection with the fda s inspection of hospira s pharmaceutical and device manufacturing facilities located in clayton  north carolina and rocky mount  north carolina 
in the warning letter  the fda cited current good manufacturing practice deficiencies related to particulate in certain emulsion products at the clayton facility and the failure to adequately validate the processes used to manufacture products at the rocky mount facility 
the warning letter also asserted other inadequacies  including procedures related to the quality control unit  investigations  and medical reporting obligations 
hospira responded to the warning letter in  and as part of its response  took immediate actions to address the fda s concerns  including recalling certain products manufactured at the clayton and rocky mount facilities 
in january  the fda completed a follow up inspection at the clayton facility to evaluate hospira s corrective actions in response to items raised in the warning letter 
the fda did not issue a form related to the clayton inspection 
the fda completed a follow up inspection at the rocky mount facility in may  and issued a form listing observations related to certain quality systems  facilities  and operating procedures 
in august  the fda completed an additional inspection at the rocky mount facility  which resulted in additional form observations that identified further areas for remediation and improvement 
hospira is implementing a comprehensive remediation plan  including obtaining the assistance of third party subject matter experts to help hospira address the fda s concerns 
hospira has implemented certain interim oversight controls  including third party oversight  product assessments  retrospective reviews of laboratory results related to out of specification findings and investigations  and the development and implementation of a comprehensive laboratory action plan 
hospira also has implemented significant management changes to the rocky mount facility s leadership team 
these remediation activities resulted in and continue to 
table of contents result in slowdowns at the rocky mount facility beginning in the third quarter of  resulting in drug shortages and costs associated with reduced production volume 
hospira will continue to interact and work closely with the fda to ensure that all items cited during the inspections and noted in both form s and the warning letter are appropriately addressed 
hospira has disclosed information about the form observations relevant to rock mount because of the warning letter 
hospira is also working to ensure all of its manufacturing facilities and quality policies  procedures and processes align with the commitments made to the fda related to the warning letter 
during  hospira recognized charges  in cost of products sold  of million for third party oversight and consulting  costs associated with reduced production volume  inventory loss and penalties for failure to supply product to certain customers 
during  hospira continued to invest in quality operations throughout its global manufacturing facilities including the clayton and rocky mount facilities 
during  hospira recognized charges  in cost of products sold  of million for third party oversight and consulting costs  and costs associated with reduced production volume at the rocky mount facility 
additionally in  hospira incurred inventory loss related charges of million at the rocky mount facility due primarily to remediation actions being implemented and the resulting impact on inventory spoilage  excess and obsolescence 
symbiq tm infusion pumps in april  hospira placed a voluntary hold on all shipments of symbiq tm infusion pumps to new customers 
hospira initiated this hold after it received an unexplained increase in customer complaints related to the failure of symbiq tm to alarm  under certain use conditions  at the end of infusion therapy 
in june  hospira notified customers of interim steps to be taken by customers to mitigate this issue and to avoid the use conditions that can lead to the failure of symbiq tm to alarm at the end of infusion therapy 
in august  hospira initiated an infusion set recall related to the issue 
additionally  hospira notified customers of reports of unrestricted flow when the symbiq tm infusion set cassette is improperly removed from the pump before the pump s cassette door is fully opened 
hospira cautioned customers to allow the pump s cassette door to fully open before removing the infusion set as the pump may not alarm when the infusion set is improperly removed 
the fda has classified each of these actions as a class i recall and hospira is working closely with the fda to conclude these matters 
hospira has not asked customers to return or cease using their symbiq tm pumps 
hospira has recognized charges for quality assessment and testing  materials  and labor to remediate these matters  which were million and million for and  respectively 
hospira has submitted the appropriate applications for modifications to its symbiq tm infusion system to regulatory agencies in various countries 
in march  hospira submitted a k application with the fda  which included software updates to further enhance the reliability of the infusion system  and to correct the recall issues impacting the device 
the fda submitted questions on the k application 
hospira has responded to the first round of questions and is preparing its response to the second round of questions 
hospira expects to respond by the end of first quarter of hospira incurred charges of million in related to remediation actions associated with the application 
new customer pump placements for symbiq tm in the us and certain other countries will remain on voluntary hold until hospira receives the clearance from the applicable regulatory agencies 
hospira believes this application is one of the first in the industry to be submitted under recent fda draft guidance for k clearances of infusion pumps  which makes it difficult to project the prospects and timeline for fda clearance 
plum tm infusion pumps in december  hospira informed the fda that it had received a number of customer reports associated with the plum a tm and plum xl tm family of infusion pumps regarding failure of the 
table of contents pump s audible alarm under certain conditions 
hospira notified customers of the corrective action plan to address this issue 
for the plum a tm pumps  the alarm failures are associated with the alarm assembly 
for the plum xl tm pumps  the alarm failure is associated with fluid ingress and physical damage to the alarm assembly over time 
plum xl tm customers were instructed to follow the proper cleaning procedure and inspect the alarm assembly for physical damage during routine maintenance 
the plum a tm and plum xl tm actions have been classified as a class ii field recall and the fda is not requiring hospira to remove any plum tm pumps from the market or halt production 
in  hospira recognized a charge of million for the estimated costs of the field recall 
in  hospira recognized an additional charge of million based on its current recall plan  and began the replacement of components for the plum a tm and expects the deployment activities to extend into comprehensive medication management product review in connection with the matters above  hospira committed to the fda that it would engage in a comprehensive product review for each of hospira s medication management products 
the product reviews are designed to confirm compliance with current regulatory requirements and document safety and performance of the products 
the product reviews will also include retrospective assessments of customer experiences with these products over the preceding two years 
the product reviews will provide hospira with important information for enhancing the reliability of these products and future products 
the product reviews  related investigations and remediation are ongoing  and the initial reviews were completed on plum tm  patient controlled analgesia pca devices  and gemstar tm 
for these infusions devices  investigations are underway 
certain remediation actions  such as product recalls or corrective field actions or preventative actions  for hospira s medication management products have been  and may be required upon finalization of the product reviews  investigations and remediation milestones 
hospira expects that the product reviews and investigations will be completed by early and expects that the remediation actions resulting from these reviews could extend over the next two to three years 
in  hospira incurred charges of million for certain remediation actions  including recalls  related to outcomes of the product reviews and related investigations  primarily related to plum tm products 
these remediation charges are based on management s best estimate of the committed corrective actions and consist primarily of development costs to address any identified issues  and costs for the deployment to the impacted customer base 
financial related impact beginning with  hospira expects to incur over the next two to three years  aggregate pre tax charges related to these quality and product related matters in the range of million to million  of which hospira incurred an aggregate of million in in  hospira had incurred approximately million of charges for these quality and product related matters however  these historical charges are not included in the estimated range 
the amount  timing and recognition of charges associated with these matters over this time period will be affected by the nature of spending and the occurrence of commitments and triggering events as defined under gaap  among other factors 
there can be no assurance that hospira will not incur additional charges should further enforcement action be taken by regulatory agencies 
further  costs for long term solutions and product improvements will depend on various production and quality development efforts and corresponding regulatory outcomes in connection therewith 
further  capital expenditures to remediate and or enhance hospira s existing facilities and operations may be required  see matters discussed in section facilities optimization and capacity expansion in this item due to the complexity and depth of these anticipated remediation activities  and dependent upon the schedules for remediation  and the outcomes from the product assessments  these matters have and 
table of contents may continue to adversely impact production  including causing further reduced production volumes  inventory accumulation and or inventory loss due to spoilage  excess  obsolescence or product failing to meet specifications 
these quality matters have and may lead to further remediation actions  including recalls or other corrective actions or further adverse regulatory actions 
additionally  these quality matters have adversely impacted  and may impact further  hospira s net sales and ability to market certain products in all segments and impact future cash flows 
further  these quality matters have resulted in  and may further result in  lower customer service levels and resulting higher customer backorders  customer accommodations and penalties for failure to supply products

goodwill impairment percent change years ended december dollars in millions goodwill impairment nm nm as a percent of net sales compared to goodwill impairment was million in  compared with million in during the third quarter of  hospira performed its annual goodwill impairment test 
hospira determined that the emea reporting unit s goodwill carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value 
hospira considered the current emea economic environment and the decline in hospira s common stock price beginning late in the third quarter of  which required an increase in the discount rate used to present value the estimated cash flows in order to reconcile hospira s market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of all of hospira s reporting units 
in addition  factors that contributed to the estimated fair value of the emea reporting unit being below its carrying value include i a decrease in projected revenues and operating margins due to continued competition and related price pressure and overall european region market conditions  and ii higher 
table of contents spending expected for strategic product portfolio expansion  in the near term to mid term with benefit to revenues and operating margin trailing the increased spending 
accordingly  hospira recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million for the emea reporting unit as the implied fair value of goodwill was less than its carrying value 
during the fourth quarter of  based on a combination of factors  including continued declines in hospira s common stock price and declines in projected revenue and operating margins in all reporting units  hospira concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment test for the emea and apac reporting units 
hospira performed the interim goodwill impairment test as of december   which indicated that the emea and apac reporting units estimated fair value was below their respective carrying value 
hospira recognized goodwill impairment charges of million and million for the emea and apac reporting units respectively  as the implied fair value of goodwill  representing hospira s best preliminary estimates  was less than their respective carrying value 
as of this filing  hospira has not completed the fourth quarter interim test  due to the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill of the emea and apac reporting units 
however  based on the work performed to date  hospira has concluded that an impairment loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the impairment charges are based on the preliminary analysis and may be subject to further adjustments in the next reporting period 
one measure of sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount of which each reporting unit s fair value exceeds their respective carrying value 
subsequent to the impairment charges incurred through december   the amount of fair value in excess of carrying value is as follows for the us  canada and latin america reporting units  the estimated fair value substantially  by greater than at least one hundred percent  exceeds their respective carrying value  for the emea reporting unit  the accumulated impairment loss equals the previous goodwill carrying value  for the apac reporting unit  the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value by approximately twenty three percent

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
hospira believes its most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
revenue recognition hospira recognizes revenues from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for other than certain drug delivery pumps and contract manufacturing  product revenue is recognized when products are delivered to customers and title 
table of contents passes 
in certain circumstances  hospira enters into arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements deliverables to its customers 
contract manufacturing involves filling customers active pharmaceutical ingredients api into delivery systems 
under these arrangements  customers api is often consigned to hospira and revenue is recorded for the materials and labor provided by hospira  plus a profit  upon shipment to the customer 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  hospira records an estimate for certain items that reduce gross sales in arriving at its reported net sales for each period 
these items include chargebacks  rebates and other items such as cash discounts and returns 
provisions for chargebacks and rebates represent the most significant and complex of these estimates 
arrangements with certain multiple deliverables hospira accounts for sales of drug delivery pumps pumps and server based suite of software applications software  inclusive of certain software related services  under multi element arrangements  depending on the functionality of the software associated with the pump  as one or two units of accounting 
hospira allocates revenue to arrangements with multiple deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  hospira applies a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when hospira sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by hospira for that deliverable 
where vsoe and tpe are not available  hospira s process for determining esp includes multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
key factors considered in developing the esp for pumps  software and software related services include prices charged by hospira for similar offerings  historical pricing practices  the market and nature of the deliverable and the relative esp of certain deliverables compared to the total selling price of the arrangement 
for certain arrangements where the software is not essential to the functionality of the pump  hospira has identified three primary deliverables 
the first deliverable is the pump which is recognized as delivered  the second deliverable is the related sale of disposable products sets which are recognized as the products are delivered and the third deliverable is the software and software related services 
revenue recognition for the third deliverable is further described below in the software section 
the allocation of revenue for the first and second deliverable is based on vsoe and for the third deliverable is based on hospira s esp 
for other arrangements where the software is essential to the functionality of the pump  hospira has also identified three primary deliverables 
the first deliverable is the pump and software essential to the functionality of the pump which is delivered and recognized at the time of installation 
the second deliverable is the related sale of sets which are recognized as the products are delivered and the third deliverable is software related services 
revenue recognition for the third deliverable is further described below in the software section 
the allocation of revenue for the first and third deliverable is based on hospira s esp 
the allocation of revenue for the second deliverable is based on vsoe 
software hospira recognizes revenue for the server based suite of software applications not essential to the functionality of a pump and related maintenance and implementation services in accordance with software specific accounting guidance 
software revenue for multiple element revenue arrangements is allocated based on the relative fair value of each element and fair value is generally determined by vsoe 
if hospira cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  hospira defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed 
perpetual software license revenue and implementation service revenue are generally recognized as obligations are completed 
software subscription license and software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable contract period 

table of contents chargebacks hospira sells a significant portion of its specialty injectable pharmaceutical products through wholesalers  which maintain inventories of hospira products and later sell those products to end customers 
in connection with its sales and marketing efforts  hospira negotiates prices with end customers for certain products under pricing agreements including  for example  group purchasing organization contracts 
consistent with industry practice  the negotiated end customer prices are typically lower than the prices charged to the wholesalers 
when an end customer purchases a hospira product that is covered by a pricing agreement from a wholesaler  the end customer pays the wholesaler the price determined under the pricing agreement 
the wholesaler is then entitled to charge hospira back for the difference between the price the wholesaler paid hospira and the contract price paid by the end customer a chargeback 
hospira records the initial sale to a wholesaler at the price invoiced to the wholesaler and at the same time  records a provision equal to the estimated amount the wholesaler will later charge back to hospira  reducing gross sales and trade receivables 
this provision must be estimated because the actual end customer and applicable pricing terms may vary at the time of the sale to the wholesaler 
accordingly  the most significant estimates inherent in the initial chargeback provision relate to the volume of sales to the wholesalers that will be subject to chargeback and the ultimate end customer contract price 
these estimates are based primarily on an analysis of hospira s product sales and most recent historical average chargeback credits by product  estimated wholesaler inventory levels  current contract pricing  anticipated future contract pricing changes and claims processing lag time 
hospira estimates the levels of inventory at the wholesalers through analysis of wholesaler purchases and inventory data obtained directly from certain wholesalers 
hospira regularly monitors the provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes the actual chargebacks may differ from earlier estimates 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for chargebacks was consistent across all periods presented 
hospira s total chargeback accrual for all products was million and million at december  and  respectively  and included in trade receivables on the consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of chargebacks generally occurs between and days after the sale to wholesalers 
a one percent decrease in end customer contract prices for sales pending chargeback at december   would decrease net sales and loss income before income taxes by approximately million 
a one percent increase in units sold subject to chargebacks held by wholesalers at december   would decrease net sales and loss income before income taxes by approximately million  compared to what sales would have been if the units sold were not subject to chargebacks 
rebates hospira offers rebates to direct customers  customers who purchase from certain wholesalers at end customer contract prices and government agencies  which administer various programs such as medicaid 
direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a contracted discount applied to the direct customer s purchases 
indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased hospira products from a wholesaler under a pricing agreement with hospira 
governmental agency rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers such as medicaid  after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases 
hospira estimates the amount of the rebate due at the time of sale  and records the liability and a reduction of gross sales at the same time the product sale is recorded 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from to months after sale 
in determining provisions for rebates to direct customers  hospira considers the volume of eligible purchases by these customers and the rebate terms 
in determining rebates on sales through wholesalers  hospira considers the volume of eligible contract purchases  the rebate terms and the estimated level of inventory at the wholesalers that would be subject to a rebate  which is estimated as described above under chargebacks 
upon receipt of a chargeback  due to the availability of product and customer specific information  hospira can then establish a specific provision for fees or rebates 
table of contents based on the specific terms of each agreement 
rebates under governmental programs are based on the estimated volume of products sold subject to these programs 
each period the estimates are reviewed and revised  if necessary  in conjunction with a review of contract volumes within the period 
hospira regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded accruals for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
at december  and  accrued rebates of million and million  respectively  are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for rebates was consistent across all periods presented 
the following table is an analysis of chargebacks and rebates for years ended and dollars in millions chargebacks rebates balance at january  provisions payments and releases balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  hospira launched generic oxaliplatin in the us in and temporarily exited the market in june  which contributed to the increase and subsequent decrease in the chargebacks and rebate accrual 
in  hospira released million for a portion of the chargeback accrual relating to for oxaliplatin sales as the expected rate of price decrease was less than estimated and typically experienced in generic product launches 
adjustments for rebates related to prior period sales have not been material in any period 
returns provisions for returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recognized  and are reflected as a reduction of sales 
the estimate of the provision for returns is primarily based on historical experience of actual returns 
additionally  hospira considers other factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel  product dating and expiration period  whether products have been discontinued and entrance in the market of additional competition 
this estimate is reviewed periodically and  if necessary  revised  with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to net sales 
accrued returns were million and million as of december  and  respectively  and included in other accrued liabilities and post retirement obligations and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market 
inventory cost includes material and conversion costs 
hospira monitors inventories for exposures related to obsolescence  excess and date expiration  non conformance  product recalls and loss and damage  and recognizes a charge to cost of products sold for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to estimated net realizable value 
if conditions are less favorable than estimated  additional charges may be required 
inventory reserves were million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents stock based compensation stock based compensation transactions are recognized as compensation cost over the vesting period based on the fair value of the instrument on the date of grant 
hospira uses the black scholes option valuation model and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock options and performance share awards  respectively 
the fair value models include various assumptions  including the expected volatility  expected life of the awards and forfeiture rates 
these assumptions reflect hospira s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira s control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if hospira uses different assumptions for future stock based compensation transactions  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding stock based compensation 
pension and other post retirement benefits hospira provides pension and other post retirement medical and dental benefits to certain of its active and retired employees based both in and outside of the us hospira develops assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rate 
for these assumptions  management consults with actuaries  monitors plan provisions and demographics and reviews public market data and general economic information 
these assumptions reflect hospira s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira s control 
assumption changes could affect the reported funded status of hospira s plans and  as a result  could result in higher funding requirements and net periodic benefit costs 
the us discount rate estimates were developed with the assistance of actuarially developed yield curves 
for non us plans  benchmark yield data for high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amounts of payments match the timing and amounts of projected benefit payments is used to derive discount rate assumptions 
the expected return on assets for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits are expected to be paid 
the expected return on assets is developed from the expected future return of each asset class  weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class 
hospira considers historical performance for the types of assets in which the plans invest  independent market forecasts and economic and capital market conditions 
sensitivity analysis for us plans which represent the primary portion of obligations is as follows year ended december  net benefit cost income expense as of december  benefit obligation increase decrease dollars in millions one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease pension plan us discount rate expected long term return on assets medical and dental plan us discount rate expected health care cost trend rate initial and ultimate 
table of contents impairment of long lived and other assets property and equipment and intangible assets  net the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets and property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment of assets with definite lives is generally determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset  or appropriate grouping of assets  to its carrying value 
indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
determining the extent of an impairment  if any  typically requires various estimates and assumptions including using management s judgment  cash flows directly attributable to the asset  the useful life of the asset and residual value  if any 
when necessary  hospira uses internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
in addition  the remaining useful life of the impaired asset is revised  if necessary 
hospira reports assets and related liabilities held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually during the third quarter of each year  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
hospira s reporting units are the us  canada  latin america  emea and apac 
the goodwill impairment test step one is based upon the estimated fair value of hospira s reporting units compared to the net carrying value of assets and liabilities 
hospira uses internal discounted cash flow dcf estimates and market value comparisons to determine estimated fair value 
if the step one test indicates that impairment potentially exists  a second step step two is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists in step two when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one and the fair value allocated to the identifiable assets  including unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities of the reporting unit 
during the third quarter of  hospira performed its annual goodwill impairment test 
hospira determined that the emea reporting unit s goodwill carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value 
accordingly  hospira recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million for the emea reporting unit  as the implied fair value of goodwill was less than its carrying value 
during the fourth quarter of  based on a combination of factors  including continued declines in hospira s common stock price and declines in projected revenue and operating margins in all reporting units  hospira concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment test for the emea and apac reporting units 
hospira performed the interim goodwill impairment test as of december   which indicated that the emea and apac reporting units estimated fair value was below their respective carrying value 
hospira recognized goodwill impairment charges of million and million for the emea and apac reporting units respectively  as the implied fair value of goodwill  representing hospira s best preliminary estimates  was less than their respective carrying value 
as of this filing  hospira has not completed the fourth quarter interim test  due to the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill of the emea and apac reporting units 
however  based on the work performed to date  hospira has concluded that an impairment loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the impairment charges are based on the preliminary analysis and may be subject to further adjustments in the next reporting period 
one measure of sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount 
table of contents of which each reporting unit s fair value exceeds their respective carrying value 
subsequent to the impairment charges incurred through december   the amount of fair value in excess of carrying value is as follows for the us  canada and latin america reporting units  the estimated fair value substantially  by greater than at least one hundred percent  exceeds their respective carrying value  for the emea reporting unit  the accumulated impairment loss equals the previous goodwill carrying value  for the apac reporting unit  the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value by approximately twenty three percent 
the goodwill impairment testing process involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity in determination of the fair value of the reporting units in step one  and  if necessary in step two  the allocation of the fair value to identifiable assets and liabilities 
estimating a reporting unit s projected cash flows involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including long term rate of revenue growth  operating margin  including research and development  selling  general and administrative expense rates  capital expenditures  allocation of shared or corporate items  among other factors 
these estimates are based on internal current operating plans and long term forecasts for each reporting unit 
these projected cash flow estimates are then discounted  which necessitates the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rates selected reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting unit 
the market value comparisons of fair value require the selection of appropriate peer group companies 
in addition  hospira analyzes differences between the sum of the fair value of the reporting units and hospira s total market capitalization for reasonableness  taking into account certain factors including control premiums 
in step two  the fair value allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  trade names  customer relationships  inventory  intangible assets both recognized and unrecognized and property  plant and equipment 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process may significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or the implied fair value of goodwill  or both 
generally  changes in dcf estimates would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
that is  a one percent decrease in estimated dcf s would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately one percent 
hospira believes that its estimates of dcf s and allocations of fair value to assets and liabilities and the above underlying assumptions used are reasonable  but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent judgment in making such estimates 
goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including deterioration in the macro economic environment or in the equity markets  including the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in hospira s plans for one or more reporting units 
investments hospira regularly reviews its investments to determine whether an impairment or other than temporary decline in market value exists 
hospira considers factors affecting the investee  factors affecting the industry the investee operates in and general equity market trends 
hospira considers the length of time an investment s market value has been below carrying value and the prospects for recovery to carrying value 
when hospira determines that an impairment or other than temporary decline has occurred  the carrying basis of the investment is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in other expense income  net 
loss contingencies hospira accrues for loss contingencies when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if a reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum loss contingency amount in the range is accrued 
these 
table of contents estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
income taxes hospira s provision for income taxes is based on taxable loss income at statutory tax rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which hospira operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are established when  despite hospira s belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority s determination of the positions 
such liabilities are based on management s judgment  utilizing internal and external tax advisors and represent management s best estimate as to the likely outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to unrecognized tax benefits 
each quarter  hospira reviews the anticipated mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions and its associated liabilities 
hospira considers prescribed recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid 
provision for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries when hospira intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely to fund foreign investments or meet working capital and plant and equipment acquisition needs

risk factors  to this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument and risk management hospira operates globally  and earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
upon consideration of management objectives  costs and opportunities  hospira uses derivative instruments  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to manage these risks 
hospira enters into derivative instrument contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure to nonperformance by any one institution 
hospira does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments hospira s operations are exposed to currency exchange rate risk  which is mitigated by hospira s use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts 
hospira s objective is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 

table of contents currency exposures primarily in euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds include foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenue and expenses  including inter company payables  receivables and loans 
these forward contracts are not designated as hedges  and  therefore  changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings in other income expense  net  during the term of the forward contract 
the fair value changes of these forward contracts are expected to offset the foreign exchange currency changes of the underlying exposure that also are recognized in earnings 
as of december   hospira had million net notional value of forward contracts purchased primarily dominated in euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds that mature within one to six months 
net forward contract income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the carrying value and fair value of forward contracts was a net receivable of million and net liability of million as of december  and  respectively 
as part of its risk management program  hospira performs a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  and  while not predictive in nature  indicated that if the us dollar uniformly fluctuates unfavorably by against all currencies  the net asset balance of million would decrease by million resulting in a net liability 
the sensitivity analysis recalculates the fair value of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  by replacing the actual exchange rates at december  with exchange rates that are unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency 
all other factors are held constant 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the analysis also disregards the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged balances 
interest rate sensitive financial instruments hospira s primary interest rate exposures relate to cash and cash equivalents  and fixed and variable rate debt 
hospira s objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
hospira utilizes a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage changes in interest rates 
in july  hospira terminated interest rate swap contracts originally entered into in december with a total notional amount of million  which had effectively converted from fixed to variable rate debt million of the million principal amount notes due in june and million of the million principal amount notes due in may as a result of the swap terminations hospira received million in cash  including accrued interest 
in june  hospira terminated interest rate swap contracts originally entered into in with a total notional amount of million  which had effectively converted from fixed to variable rate debt million of the million principal amount notes due in june and million of the million principal amount notes due in may as a result of the swap terminations  hospira received million in cash  including accrued interest 
as part of its risk management program  hospira performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates associated with outstanding interest rates swap contracts 
historically  a basis point change in interest rates affecting hospira s interest rate swap contracts  would have an immaterial effect on the annual earnings over the term of the related instruments 
hospira s investment portfolio of million at december   consists of cash and cash equivalents  equity investments in affiliated companies and marketable and cost method investments 
marketable investments consist of marketable securities classified as available for sale 
the carrying 
table of contents value of the investment portfolio approximates fair market value at december   and the value at maturity  as the majority of investments consist of securities with maturities of less than three months 
because hospira s investments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates  based on average cash and cash equivalents during the year  would increase decrease interest income by approximately million 
hospira has a revolving line of credit revolver that allows borrowings up to billion for general corporate purposes at variable interest rates 
the amount of available borrowings under the revolver may be increased to a maximum of billion  under certain circumstances 
as of december   hospira has not borrowed any amounts under the revolver
