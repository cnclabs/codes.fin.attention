executive summary financial highlights and trends in  we generated net sales of billion  as compared to billion in  a decrease of million  or two percent 
our sales declined approximately million as a result of the sale of our neurovascular business in january  offsetting this decline was the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations  which contributed million to our net sales in  as compared to excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses  our net sales decreased million  or two percent  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to constant currency declines in net sales from our interventional cardiology division of million and constant currency declines in net sales from our cardiac rhythm management crm business of million 
these decreases were partially offset by constant currency increases in net sales from our endoscopy business of million  net sales from our peripheral interventions business of million  and net sales from our neuromodulation business of million  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
in addition  our net sales were negatively impacted by approximately million as a result of the us crm ship hold

business and market overview coronary stent systems we are the only company in the industry to offer a two drug platform strategy  which we believe has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the drug eluting stent market 
we market our next generation internally developed and self manufactured promus element drug eluting stent platform in the us  our europe middle east africa emea region and certain inter continental countries  including china beginning in the fourth quarter of we market our promus everolimus eluting stent system  supplied to us by abbott laboratories in japan 
we expect to launch our promus element stent system in japan at or before mid we also offer our taxus paclitaxel eluting stent line  including our third generation taxus element stent system in the us  japan  emea and certain inter continental countries 
our element stent platform incorporates a unique platinum chromium alloy designed to offer greater radial strength and flexibility  enhanced visibility and reduced recoil  compared to older alloys 
the innovative stent design improves deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution 
these product offerings demonstrate our commitment to drug eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation 
our coronary stent system offerings also include the veriflex libert bare metal coronary stent system and our third generation omega platinum chromium bare metal coronary stent system 
net sales of our coronary stent systems  including bare metal stent systems  of billion represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales in worldwide net sales of these products decreased million  or three percent  in  as compared to excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which contributed million to our coronary stent system net sales in  as compared to the prior year  net sales of these products decreased million  or six percent 
despite continued competition and pricing pressures  we maintained our leadership position during with an estimated percent share of the worldwide drug eluting stent market 
during the second quarter of  one of our competitors announced plans to exit the drug eluting stent market 
although the full impact on the market remains uncertain  we believe this 
table of contents presents an opportunity for us to expand our presence in the worldwide drug eluting stent market and the broader cardiovascular market 
the following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales year ended year ended in millions december  december  us international total us international total taxus promus promus element drug eluting bare metal our us net sales of drug eluting stent systems decreased million  or seven percent  in  as compared to the decline was due to an overall decrease in the size of the market  resulting principally from lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures  and lower procedural volumes 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in our share of the us drug eluting stent market due largely to the launch of our third generation taxus element stent system in the us commercialized as ion in the second quarter of we estimate that the average selling price of drug eluting stent systems in the us decreased approximately seven percent in  as compared to and estimate that the number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed decreased one percent in  as compared to we believe that average drug eluting stent penetration rates a measure of the mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents used across procedures in the us were percent during both and in addition  we believe our share of the us drug eluting stent market approximated percent in  as compared to percent in during the fourth quarter of  we received fda approval and began launching our next generation  internally developed and self manufactured promus element everolimus eluting stent platform in the us our promus element stent system has significantly higher gross profit and operating profit margins as compared to our promus stent system  which is supplied to us by abbott  based on the terms of the promus supply arrangement 
we expect to fully convert our us drug eluting stent system sales to self manufactured promus element and taxus stent systems during we believe that our element platinum chromium stent platform  combined with our two drug platform strategy and broad range of stent sizes  provides a competitive advantage that has allowed us to expand our leadership position in the us drug eluting stent market 
our international drug eluting stent system net sales increased million  or four percent  in  as compared to excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which contributed million to our international drug eluting stent system net sales in  as compared to the prior year  net sales of our drug eluting stent systems decreased million  or two percent 
our net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our inter continental region increased million  or nine percent  on a constant currency basis  in  as compared to  driven by sales growth in key emerging markets  including china  brazil and india 
our net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our emea region decreased million  or one percent in  as compared to  due primarily to declines in average selling prices 
net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in japan decreased million  or percent  on a constant currency basis  in  as compared to  driven primarily by a loss of market share due to competitive launches 
we are currently reliant on abbott laboratories for our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems in japan 
our supply agreement with abbott for everolimus eluting stent systems extends through june  at present  we believe that our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems from abbott  coupled with our current launch plans for our internally developed and self manufactured next generation promus element everolimus eluting stent system in japan  currently expected at or before mid  will be sufficient to meet our customer demand 
historically  the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs  patient populations and trial end points 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us  our competitors or third parties  or the market s perception of these clinical data  may adversely impact our position in  and share of  the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market 
we believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market in the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons  including 
table of contents our two drug platform strategy  including specialty stent sizes  the broad and consistent long term results of our taxus clinical trials  and the favorable results of xience v promus  promus element and taxus element ion stent system clinical trials to date  the performance benefits of our current and future technology  the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products  including our promus element stent system  launched in the us in the fourth quarter of and expected to be launched in japan at or before mid  our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force  the strength of our clinical  selling  marketing and manufacturing capabilities  and our increased presence and investment in the rapidly growing emerging markets  including china and india 
however  a decline in net sales from our drug eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting stent market and our position within this market include  but are not limited to the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems available in the market  the impact and outcomes of on going and future clinical results involving our or our competitors products  including those trials sponsored by our competitors  or perceived product performance of our or our competitors products  physician and patient confidence in our current and next generation technology  our ability to timely and successfully launch next generation products and technology features  including the promus element stent system in japan  changes in drug eluting stent penetration rates  the overall number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed and the average number of stents used per procedure  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  new product launches by our competitors  and the outcome of intellectual property litigation 
during  and  we successfully negotiated closure of several long standing legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters  however  there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation  particularly in the coronary stent market 
in particular  although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with johnson johnson  we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them  primarily relating to drug eluting stent systems 
adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins  financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems in addition to coronary stent systems  our interventional cardiology business markets balloon catheters  rotational atherectomy systems  guide wires  guide catheters  embolic protection devices  and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca procedures  as well as intravascular ultrasound ivus imaging systems 
our worldwide net sales of these products were million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or six percent 
our us net sales were million in  as compared to million in our international net sales of these products were million in  as compared to million in  and included a million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems net sales decreased million  or nine percent  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily the result of competitive pricing pressures  market wide reductions in procedural volumes and market share declines in our ivus business 
we continue to hold a strong leadership position in the ptca balloon catheter market  with an estimated percent average share of the us market and percent of the worldwide market in in june  we launched the nc quantum apex post dilatation balloon catheter  developed specifically to address physicians needs in optimizing coronary stent deployment  which has been received positively in the market and  in the second half of  also launched our apex pre dilatation balloon catheter with platinum marker bands for improved radiopacity

worldwide net sales of our crm products of billion represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales in our worldwide crm net sales decreased million  or four percent  in  as compared to excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which contributed million to our crm net sales as compared to  our crm net sales decreased million  or seven percent 
the following are the components of our worldwide crm net sales year ended year ended in millions december  december  us international total us international total icd systems pacemaker systems crm products our us crm net sales decreased million  or percent  in  as compared to the reduction in our crm net sales during reflects the impact of a contraction in the us icd market 
we believe the us icd market contraction is due to a variety of factors  including physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association regarding evidence based guidelines for icd implants  us department of justice doj investigations into hospitals icd implant practices and the expansion of medicare recovery audits  as well as on going physician alignment to hospitals and competitive pricing pressures 
in addition  our net sales were negatively impacted by approximately million as a result of not selling certain of our us crm products during portions of the first and second quarters of on march   we announced a ship hold and removal of our field inventory related to our icd and crt d systems in the us after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the fda 
during the second quarter of  we submitted the required documentation and received clearance from the fda for these manufacturing changes and resumed distribution of our icd and crt d systems

these transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective through the end of  subject to extension 
we recorded revenue of million during related to this divested business as compared to million of sales of neurovascular and other divested product lines in our sales related to divested businesses will continue to decline as the various transition services and supply agreements terminate 
see results of operations and note c divestitures and assets held for sale for additional information 
restructuring initiatives on an on going basis  we monitor the dynamics of the economy  the healthcare industry  and the markets in which we compete  and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency  and better alignment of expenses with revenues  while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects  capital and our people that are essential to our long term success 
as a result of these assessments  we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long term success 
these initiatives are described below  and additional information can be found in results of operations and note h restructuring related activities to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 

table of contents restructuring plan on july   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a restructuring initiative the restructuring plan designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies  increase competitiveness and support new investments  thereby increasing shareholder value 
we estimate that the execution of the plan will reduce annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately million to million exiting  a portion of which will be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth  including priority growth and emerging markets initiatives 
key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities  relocating select administrative and functional activities  rationalizing organizational reporting structures  leveraging preferred vendors  and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency 
among these efforts  we are expanding our ability to deliver best in class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets 
this action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost reducing and productivity enhancing opportunities 
in addition  we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions  eliminate bureaucracy  increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies 
activities under the restructuring plan were initiated in the third quarter of and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of restructuring plan on february   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives the restructuring plan designed to focus our business  drive innovation  accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value 
key activities under the plan include the integration of our cardiovascular and crm businesses  as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions  the re alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets  and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio 
we estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre tax operating expenses of approximately million to million  once completed in we expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business 
activities under the restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of plant network optimization in january  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plant network optimization program  which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities 
the program is a complement to our restructuring plan  and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins 
we estimate that the program will result in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately million exiting these savings are in addition to the estimated million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our completed restructuring plan 
activities under the plant network optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of healthcare reform the patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood  therefore  it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law 
the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a percent excise tax on us sales of class i  ii and iii medical devices beginning in january us net sales represented approximately percent of our worldwide net sales in and  therefore  this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
other provisions of this law  including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs  comparative effectiveness research  an independent payment advisory board  and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies  could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered  and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases 
any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
further  we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the us or internationally 
results of operations net sales as of december   we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions the united states  emea  consisting 
table of contents of europe  the middle east and africa  japan  and inter continental  consisting of our asia pacific and the americas operating segments  which include the emerging markets of brazil  china and india 
the reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment 
we manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis  and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level 
management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance 
to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to us dollars using standard currency exchange rates 
the regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in note o segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
the following tables provide our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis 
we have restated regional net sales for and to exclude sales from our former neurovascular business  which we sold to stryker corporation in january  and present net sales from this business within divested businesses in the tables below 
net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not financial measures prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a replacement for  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure

partially offsetting these decreases  our endoscopy business increased us net sales million  as compared to  due primarily to continued commercialization and adoption of products within our stent franchise  and our neuromodulation division increased us net sales million  as compared to  due primarily to higher procedural volumes and positive momentum from new product launches 
refer to business and market overview for further discussion of our net sales 
during  our us net sales decreased million  or seven percent  as compared to the decrease was driven primarily by lower us crm net sales of million  due primarily to the us crm ship hold and product removal actions impacting our icd and crt d systems during in the us on march   we announced a ship hold and removal of our field inventory related to our icd and crt d systems in the us after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the fda 
during the second quarter of  we submitted the required documentation and received clearance from the fda for these manufacturing changes and resumed distribution of our icd and crt d systems 
the reduction in our us crm net sales was due to lost sales of approximately million during the ship hold  and a reduction of market share following the ship hold 
we estimate our us defibrillator market share decreased basis points exiting  as compared to the prior year  due primarily to these product actions 
our us net sales were also negatively impacted by a decline in us coronary stent system net sales of million  due primarily to a decline in our share of the us drug eluting stent market as well as lower average selling prices 
in addition  us net sales of our interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems business decreased million in  as compared to these decreases were partially offset by increases of us net sales in from our endoscopy business of million  million attributable to our urology women s health business  and million of growth in our neuromodulation business  as compared to international net sales during  our international net sales increased million  or seven percent  as compared to changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed million to our international net sales in as compared to contributing to the year over year growth in international net sales  were constant currency increases from our endoscopy business  primarily due to the strength of our wallflex line of stents  and our peripheral interventions business  driven by growth in all three of our pi product franchises 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales in our inter continental region increased million  or nine percent  in  as compared to  primarily as a result of strong growth in china  brazil and india as we begin to see a return on our commercial investment in these areas

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  net sales in our emea region decreased million  or one percent  in  as compared the prior year 
our net sales in japan decreased million  or nine percent  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in  as compared to  due primarily to competitive launches of drug eluting stent system technology and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain drug eluting stent system customers  as well as reductions in average selling prices

gross profit our gross profit was billion in  billion in  and billion in as a percentage of net sales  our gross profit decreased to percent in  as compared to percent in and percent in the following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period year ended december  gross profit prior year promus supply true up drug eluting stent system sales mix and pricing impact of crm ship hold neurovascular divestiture transition related inventory charges all other  including period expenses  other inventory charges and net impact of foreign currency gross profit current year the primary factor contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin during  as compared to  was the negative impact of lower sales of neurovascular products and at significantly lower gross profit margins as result of the divestiture of our neurovascular business in january and the terms of transitional supply agreements with stryker 
in addition  we recognized transition related inventory charges of million in  primarily related to promus excess inventory and purchase commitments as a result of our fourth quarter launch of our internally developed and self manufactured next generation promus element stent system in the us the decreases in were partially offset by the positive impact of a million credit to cost of products sold recognized in the first quarter of  related to a two year retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems 
our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted in the future as a result of this adjustment process 
declines in average selling prices of our products  particularly our drug eluting stent systems  were offset by the positive impact of product mix related to sales of our drug eluting stent systems  as we shifted sales to our internally developed and manufactured stent systems with more favorable gross profit margins during  as well as the positive impact of cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs 
in addition  our gross profit margin in was negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us crm business 
the primary factor contributing to the reduction in our gross profit margin during  as compared to  was a decrease in sales of our higher margin taxus drug eluting stent systems and an increasing shift towards the promus stent system during  as well as declines in the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems 
sales of the promus stent system represented approximately percent of our worldwide drug eluting stent system sales in  as compared to percent in as a result of the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the gross profit margin of a promus stent system  supplied to us by abbott  is significantly lower than our internally developed and manufactured taxus stent system and promus element everolimus eluting stent system 
our gross profit margin in was also negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us crm business 
operating expenses the following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses 
table of contents year ended december  of net of net of net in millions sales sales sales selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses royalty expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in  our sg a expenses decreased million  or four percent  as compared to  and were basis points lower as a percentage of net sales 
our sg a expenses were lower in  as compared to  as a result of the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker in january and lower expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and cost containment discipline 
in addition  our sg a expenses for benefited from the reversal of million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long outstanding receivables in greece in these receivables had previously been fully reserved as we had determined that they had a high risk of being uncollectible due to the economic situation in greece 
during the first quarter of  the greek government converted these receivables into bonds  which we were able to monetize  reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to sg a expense 
we continue to monitor the european economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables in this region 
these decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as well as additional sg a expenses related to our recent acquisitions and global expansion initiatives 
in  our sg a expenses decreased million  or two percent  as compared to this decrease was related primarily to savings from our restructuring initiatives driven by lower head count and lower consulting and travel spending  as compared to the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by an million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations 
as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses were slightly higher than due to the impact of maintaining compensation levels for our us crm sales force  despite the reduction in net sales of our crm products in the us research and development r d expenses in  our r d expenses decreased million  or five percent  as compared to  and were basis points lower as a percentage of net sales 
the decrease in was due to the elimination of spending related to our neurovascular business  cost reductions associated with our restructuring programs and the beginning benefits of our initiatives to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient  partially offset by increased r d funding for our acquisitions and certain other priority growth initiatives 
we remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth 
in  our r d expenses decreased million  or nine percent  as compared to this decrease was due to the on going re prioritization of r d projects and the re allocation of spending as part of our efforts to focus on products with higher returns  as well as the delay of certain of our clinical trials 
royalty expense in  our royalty expense decreased million  or seven percent  as compared to  and was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales 
the decrease relates primarily to royalty expense attributable to neurovascular products which was eliminated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january these royalties represented million of expense in in  our royalty expense decreased million  or three percent  as compared to this decrease was due primarily to lower sales of our drug eluting coronary stent systems  partially offset by the continued shift in the mix of our drug eluting stent system sales towards the promus and promus element stent systems 
the royalty rate applied to sales of these stent systems is  on average  higher than that associated with sales of our taxus stent systems 
loss on program termination in the second quarter of  we discontinued one of our internal r d programs in order to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax loss of million  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations  associated with future payments 
table of contents that we believe we remain contractually obligated to make 
we do not believe that the cancellation of this program will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows 
amortization expense our amortization expense was million in  as compared to million in a decrease of million or percent 
this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of this non cash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
amortization expense was million in  as compared to million in  an increase of million  or less than one percent 
goodwill impairment charges charge we test our april goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
based on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of  we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market  which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm business unit 
therefore  we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a non deductible goodwill impairment charge of million  on both a pre tax and after tax basis  associated with this business unit during the first quarter of we used the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method  to derive the fair value of the us crm reporting unit 
we updated all aspects of the dcf model associated with the us crm business  including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rate and the appropriate market participant risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc to apply 
as a result of physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association regarding evidence based guidelines for icd implants and us department of justice doj investigations into hospitals icd implant practices and the expansion of medicare recovery audits  among other factors  we estimated the us crm market would experience negative growth rates in  as compared to due to these estimated near term market reductions  as well as the economic impact of physician alignment to hospitals  recent demographic information released by the american heart association indicating a lower prevalence of heart failure  and increased competitive and other pricing pressures  we lowered our estimated average us crm net sales growth rates within our year dcf model from the mid single digits to the low single digits 
partially offsetting these factors are increased levels of profitability as a result of cost reduction initiatives and process efficiencies within the us crm business 
the impact of the reduction in the size of the us icd market  and the related reduction in our forecasted us crm net sales  as well as the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter as a result of the trends noted above were the key factors contributing to the first quarter goodwill impairment charge 
in the second quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units 
in conjunction with our annual test  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  with the exception of our us crm reporting unit 
based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of  the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit exceeded its fair value  due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit 
the remaining book value of our us crm amortizable intangible assets was approximately billion as of december  in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other and our accounting policies  we tested our us crm amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis as of march   in conjunction with the goodwill impairment charge  and determined that these assets were not impaired 
the assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the second quarter of related to our us crm reporting unit were substantially consistent with those used in our first quarter interim impairment test  therefore  it was not deemed necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
we continue to identify four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods 
these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit  which holds million of allocated goodwill  our us cardiovascular reporting unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  our us neuromodulation reporting unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  and our emea region  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  each as of december  as of the most recent annual assessment as of april  the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us 
table of contents crm reporting unit  whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value ranged from approximately eight percent to percent 
on a quarterly basis  we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test 
the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates  levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions  as well as the wacc rate applied 
these assumptions are subject to uncertainty  including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels 
for each of these reporting units  relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions  including increases to the reporting unit carrying value  may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges 
for example  keeping all other variables constant  a basis point increase in the wacc applied to the reporting units  excluding acquisitions  would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit  and a basis point increase would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us neuromodulation  us cardiovascular and emea reporting units 
in addition  keeping all other variables constant  a basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit  and a basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us neuromodulation and emea reporting units 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we closely monitored these key variables and other factors and determined that we were not required to perform an interim impairment test 
the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management s best estimates  which we believe to be reasonable  but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill balance 
future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include  but are not limited to decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater than expected declines in procedural volumes  pricing pressures  product actions  and or disruptive technology developments  declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition  an inability to develop or launch new products  and market and or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls  the impacts of the european sovereign debt crisis  including greater than expected declines in pricing  reductions in procedural volumes  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  or an inability to collect or factor our emea accounts receivable  decreases in our profitability due to an inability to successfully implement and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations  increases in our market participant tax rate  and or changes in tax laws  negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products  the level of success of on going and future research and development efforts  including those related to recent acquisitions  and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products  the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies  achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations  and establishing government and third party payer reimbursement  and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully  declines in revenue as a result of loss of key members of our sales force and other key personnel  increases in our market participant risk adjusted wacc  and changes in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses 
negative changes in one or more of these factors could result in additional impairment charges 
charge the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us icd and crt d products  which we announced on march   and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm reporting unit during the first quarter of therefore  we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded an estimated non deductible goodwill impairment charge of billion  on both a pre tax and after tax basis  associated with our us crm reporting unit 
at the time we performed our interim goodwill impairment test  we estimated that our us defibrillator market share would decrease approximately basis points exiting as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions  as compared to our 
table of contents market share exiting  and that these actions would negatively impact our us crm revenues by approximately million 
in addition  we expected that our on going us crm net sales and profitability would likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions 
therefore  as a result of these product actions  as well as lower expectations of market growth in new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures  we lowered our estimated average us crm net sales growth rates within our year dcf model  as well as our terminal value growth rate  by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair value of the us crm reporting unit 
the reduction in our forecasted us crm net sales  the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge 
partially offsetting these factors was a basis point reduction in our estimated market participant risk adjusted wacc used in determining our discount rate 
goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows  and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
intangible asset impairment charges charges during the third quarter of  we recorded a million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of expected cash flows related to certain purchased research and development projects 
we do not believe that these impairments  or the factors causing these impairments  will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows 
charges during the first quarter of  due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our peripheral interventions technology offerings  as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology  we lowered our sales forecasts associated with the product 
in addition  during the third quarter of  as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio  we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success 
as a result of these factors  and in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies  we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded a million charge in the first quarter of  and a million charge in the third quarter of to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value 
we do not believe that these impairments  or the factors causing these impairments  will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows 
charges in  we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of million  associated primarily with lower than anticipated market penetration of one of our urology technology offerings 
we do not believe that these impairments will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows 
these non cash charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
contingent consideration expense in connection with certain of our acquisitions completed after our adoption of asc topic  business combinations  in  we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue  regulatory and commercialization based milestones 
as of the respective acquisition dates  we recorded contingent consideration liabilities representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired businesses 
in accordance with asc topic  we re measure these liabilities each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from accretion of the liability due to the passage of time  changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or changes in the expected probability and timing of achieving regulatory or commercialization milestones  changes in discount rates  and payments 
we recorded net expense of million during and expense of million during  representing the change in the estimated fair value of these obligations 
the expense recorded during included a million benefit related to the reduction in the fair value of a payment liability due to a revised estimate of the probability of achieving a future research and development milestone before a specified time period 
we do not believe that this revised timing  or the factors causing the fair value adjustment of this contingent liability  will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows 
these acquisition related charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 

table of contents acquisition related milestone in connection with abbott laboratories acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses  abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of million upon receipt of an approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw to market the xience v stent system in japan 
the mhlw approved the xience v stent system in the first quarter of and we received the milestone payment from abbott  which we recorded as a million pre tax gain 
this non recurring acquisition related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance 
purchased research and development during  we recorded purchased research and development charges of million  associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements  in accordance with our accounting policies and us gaap

plant network optimization program in january  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plant network optimization program  which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities 
the program is a complement to our restructuring plan  discussed below  and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins 
we estimate that the program will result in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately million exiting these savings are in addition to the million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs expected from activities under our completed restructuring plan

restructuring plan in october  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expense and head count reduction plan the restructuring plan 
the plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value 
the execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and sg a expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately million exiting we have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases  primarily in customer facing positions 
in addition  we expect reductions of manufacturing costs by an annualized run rate of approximately million as a result of transfers of certain production lines

further  in  we reduced previously recorded reserves associated with certain litigation related matters following certain favorable court rulings  resulting in a credit of million and recorded a pre tax charge of million associated with the settlement of all outstanding litigation with another party 
gain on divestiture in january  we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation for a purchase price of billion in cash 
we received billion during  and we will receive an additional million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities  which we expect will occur during we recorded a pre tax gain of million million after tax during associated with the transaction 
we also have recorded a deferred gain of approximately million  included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  which is being recognized upon the performance of certain activities under the transition services and supply agreements 
this non recurring divestiture related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance 
interest expense our interest expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels  due to repayment of billion of debt during  as well as lower average borrowing rates 
our average borrowing rate was percent in and percent in in addition  our interest expense included million of write offs of debt issuance costs  discounts  and the impacts of the early termination of interest rate derivative contracts associated with loan prepayments  whereas interest expense included million associated with the write off of debt issuance costs  and a million benefit associated with interest rate derivative contracts terminated during refer to liquidity and capital resources and note f borrowings and credit arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for information regarding our debt obligations 
our interest expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels  due to term loan prepayments throughout  as well as the prepayment of our million loan from abbott laboratories and a slight decrease in our average borrowing rate 
our average borrowing rate was percent in and percent in in addition  our interest expense included million of write offs of debt issuance costs and impacts of the early termination of interest rate derivative contracts  as compared to million in these decreases were partially offset by the write off of the remaining million discount attributable to the abbott loan upon prepayment 
other  net our other  net reflected income of million in  expense of million in  and expense of million in the following are the components of other  net year ended december  in millions interest income foreign currency losses net gains losses on investments other expense  net during  we recognized gains of million associated with acquisitions in which we held prior equity interests 
partially offsetting these gains were net losses of million in and net losses of million in  relating to the write down of investments in our portfolio 
the acquisition related credit is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance 
tax rate the following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate 
table of contents year ended december  reported tax rate impact of certain receipts charges these receipts charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
the change in our reported tax rate for  as compared to  and  relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
in  these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the neurovascular business  a non deductible goodwill impairment charge  other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring  litigation and acquisition related charges and credits 
our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items  related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets  changes in various state tax laws  the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the internal revenue service irs  the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions  and the finalization of our us federal tax return 
in  these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition related milestone payment  and restructuring related charges 
in  our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items  related primarily to the re measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third party case and the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third party case 
in  these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges  purchased research and development charges  restructuring and litigation related net charges  a favorable tax ruling on a divestiture related gain recognized in a prior period  and discrete tax items associated primarily with resolutions of uncertain tax positions related to audit settlements and changes in estimates for tax benefits claimed related to prior periods 
we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its through tax years and boston scientific corporation for its and tax years 
subsequent to issuing these notices  the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment 
the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is billion plus interest 
the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant 
in addition  the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidant s vascular intervention business to abbott in april we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third party agreement with abbott 
in addition  we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations 
we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed  or will timely file  petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge 
no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved  which  based on experiences of other companies  could take several years 
we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand  comprised of million invested in money market and government funds  million invested in short term time deposits  and million in interest bearing and non interest bearing bank accounts 
our policy is to invest excess cash in short term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal  and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer 
we also have full access to our billion revolving credit facility and million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our us trade receivables  both described below 
the following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows outflows for the years ended december   and 
table of contents year ended december  in millions cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used for investing activities cash used for financing activities operating activities during  we generated billion from operating activities  as compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase was driven primarily by lower litigation related payments of approximately billion 
our litigation related payments primarily consisted of a payment of million to the doj  during  we made payments of billion to johnson johnson related to a patent litigation settlement and received million in connection with a litigation settlement with medinol 
our cash provided by operating activities in also included proceeds of approximately million related to the termination of our outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and the receipt of a million manufacturing cost true up payment from abbott in accordance with our supply agreement 
partially offsetting these items was lower operating profit in and higher tax related net cash outflows of approximately million during  primarily due to federal tax refunds received in in addition  our cash flows include the receipt of a million milestone payment from abbott 
our operating cash flows were million lower than our operating cash flows 
this was primarily due to net legal payments of approximately billion in  as compared to approximately million of legal payments in this increase in cash outflows for legal payments was partially offset by the receipt of a million milestone payment from abbott in investing activities during  cash provided by investing activities was comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker 
we received billion of net cash proceeds during related to the sale of this business 
we will also receive an additional million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities  which we expect will be completed during this cash inflow was partially offset by payments of million for acquisitions consummated during  and capital expenditures  net of proceeds on sales of fixed assets  of million 
our capital expenditures in included investments to automate our distribution facilities and to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to support continued growth in our business units 
we expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately million during during  our investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of million  as well as payments of approximately million to acquire asthmatx  inc and certain other strategic assets 
during  our investing activities included million of payments related to prior period acquisitions 
our investing activities in also included capital expenditures of million  payments for investments in privately held companies  and acquisitions of businesses and certain technology rights of million  which were offset by proceeds from the sale of investments in  and collection of notes receivable from  certain publicly traded and privately held companies  of million 
financing activities our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt  proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs  discussed in note l stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
debt we made payments on debt  net of proceeds from borrowings  of billion in  million in  and million in we had total debt of billion as of december  and billion as of december  during  we prepaid the remaining billion of our term loan and paid million of our senior notes at maturity 
the debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of december  is as follows 
table of contents payments due by period in millions thereafter total senior notes note the table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes  or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes 
in july  fitch ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to bbb  an investment grade rating  and in february  moody s investors service upgraded our corporate credit rating to baa  an investment grade rating 
in addition  standard poor s ratings services has maintained an investment grade corporate credit rating for us since we believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows  the reduction of our debt  and our improved financial fundamentals 
term loan and revolving credit facility during  we prepaid the remaining billion of our term loan maturities without premium or penalty 
we maintain a billion revolving credit facility  maturing in june  with up to two one year extension options subject to certain conditions 
any revolving credit facility borrowings bear interest at libor plus an interest margin of between percent and percent  based on our corporate credit ratings percent  as of december  
in addition  we are required to pay a facility fee based on our credit ratings and the total amount of revolving credit commitments  regardless of usage  under the agreement percent  as of december  
the fitch upgrade resulted in a slightly favorable reduction in the facility fee and the interest rate on the facility during any borrowings under the revolving credit facility are unrestricted and unsecured 
there were no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of december  or december  our revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants  as follows covenant requirement actual as of december  maximum leverage ratio times times minimum interest coverage ratio times times ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined by the agreement  as amended  for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters 
ratio of consolidated ebitda  as defined by the agreement  as amended  to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters 
the credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated ebitda  as defined by the agreement  through the credit agreement maturity  of up to million in restructuring charges and restructuring related expenses related to our previously announced restructuring plans  plus an additional million for any future restructuring initiatives  including our restructuring plan 
as of december   we had million of the combined restructuring charge exclusion remaining 
in addition  any litigation related charges and credits are excluded from the calculation of consolidated ebitda until such items are paid or received  and up to billion of any future cash payments for future litigation settlements or damage awards net of any litigation payments received  as well as litigation related cash payments net of cash receipts of up to billion related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements as of march  are excluded from the calculation of consolidated ebitda 
as of december   we had billion of the combined legal payment exclusion remaining 
as of and through december   we were in compliance with the required covenants 
our inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants  both of which could result in additional borrowing costs 
further  there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers 
senior notes we had senior notes outstanding in the amount of billion as of december  and billion as of december  in january  we paid million of our senior notes at maturity 

table of contents other arrangements we also maintain a million credit and security facility secured by our us trade receivables 
in august  we extended the maturity of this facility to august there were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of december  or december  we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain european countries that we account for as sales under asc topic  transfers and servicing 
these agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties  without recourse  of up to approximately million euro translated to approximately million as of december  
we have no retained interests in the transferred receivables  other than collection and administrative responsibilities and  once sold  the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy 
we de recognized million of receivables as of december  at an average interest rate of percent  and million as of december  at an average interest rate of percent 
the european sovereign debt crisis may impact our future ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain southern european countries 
third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt 
this could result in terminations of  or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs 
such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding 
within italy  spain  and portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has continued to increase 
we believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to our italy  spain and portugal accounts receivable  however  we will continue to monitor the european economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables 
in addition  we are currently pursuing alternative factoring providers and financing arrangements to mitigate our credit exposure to receivables in this region 
during the first quarter of  the greek government converted a significant portion of our outstanding receivables into bonds  which we monetized during the first quarter and reduced our credit exposure in this country 
in addition  we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to billion japanese yen translated to approximately million as of december  
we de recognized million of notes receivable as of december  at an average interest rate of percent and million of notes receivable as of december  at an average interest rate of percent 
de recognized accounts and notes receivable are excluded from trade accounts receivable  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets included in item of this annual report 
equity during  we received million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  as compared to million in  and million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees 
in may  our board of directors and shareholders approved our long term incentive plan the ltip  authorizing the issuance of up to approximately million shares of our common stock 
the ltip provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted common stock  deferred stock units  options to acquire our common stock  stock appreciation rights  performance awards and other stock and non stock awards 
in addition  in july  our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to billion in shares of our common stock and re approved approximately million shares remaining under a previous share repurchase program 
any repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for approximately million  pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations 
as of december   we had million remaining authorization under our share repurchase program and million shares authorized under our previous share repurchase programs 
stock based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was million in  million in  and million in stock based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon  among other factors the timing  number and fair value of awards granted during the period  forfeiture levels related to unvested awards  and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan 
we generally make equity awards on an annual basis during the month of february 
prior to mid  we expensed stock based awards over the period between grant date and retirement eligibility  or immediately if the employee was retirement eligible at the date of grant 
therefore  during the first quarter of each year  stock based compensation expense has historically been significantly higher than other quarters 
however  for awards granted after mid  retirement eligible employees must now provide one year of service after the date of grant in order to retain the award  should they retire 
therefore  for awards granted after mid to employees who will become retirement eligible prior to vesting  we expense stock based awards over the greater of the period between grant date and retirement eligibility date or one year 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments  and is based on conditions in existence as of december  payments due by period in millions thereafter total long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty obligations unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts in the table above with respect to operating lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property  plant and equipment used in the normal course of business 
purchase obligations relate primarily to non cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business 
royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements 
the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of billion  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note j income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits 
certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration 
the table above does not reflect any such obligations  as the timing and amounts are uncertain 
see note b acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of december  legal matters the medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven 
physician customers  particularly in interventional cardiology  have historically moved quickly to adopt new products and new technologies 
as a result  intellectual property rights  particularly patents and trade secrets  play a significant role in product development and differentiation 
however  intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable 
furthermore  appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions 
in addition  competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines  technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties 
in some cases  several competitors are parties in the same proceeding  or in a series of related proceedings  or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices 
these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases  but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases 
in addition  although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought  remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal 
accordingly  the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time  predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies 
several third parties have asserted that certain of our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them 
we have similarly asserted that other products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us 
adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions  or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
in particular  although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with johnson johnson  and have recently received several favorable court rulings  we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them  particularly relating to drug eluting stent systems 
adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins  financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
in the normal course of business  product liability  securities and commercial claims are asserted against us 
similar claims may 
table of contents be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time 
we are substantially self insured with respect to product liability claims and intellectual property infringement  and maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims 
the absence of significant third party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions 
product liability claims  securities and commercial litigation  and other legal proceedings in the future  regardless of their outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
in addition  the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations often involving regulatory  marketing and other business practices 
these investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings  substantial fines  penalties and administrative remedies  divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
we generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable 
in accordance with asc topic  contingencies  we accrue anticipated costs of settlement  damages  losses for general product liability claims and  under certain conditions  costs of defense  based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable 
otherwise  we expense these costs as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was million as of december  and million as of december   and includes estimated costs of settlement  damages and defense 
the decrease in our accrual is due primarily to the payment of million to the doj in order resolve the us government investigation of guidant corporation related to product advisories issued in we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts  if any  that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and  therefore  additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future  which could materially adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and or our ability to comply with our debt covenants 
see further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note k commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies 
we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
we describe these accounting polices in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical revenue recognition we allow our customers to return defective  damaged and  in certain cases  expired products for credit 
we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product 
in addition  we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings 
for these transactions  we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 
many of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system  which represents a future service obligation 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation  we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations  therefore  we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available  otherwise  we use our best estimate of selling price 
we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral 
inventory provisions we base our provisions for excess  expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales 
a significant 
table of contents change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess  expired and obsolete inventory in the future 
further  the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess  expired and obsolete inventory 
valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination  including purchased research and development  on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management  which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use 
further  for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration  we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future 
we re measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates  as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory  revenue or commercialization based milestones 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated revenue projections  growth rates  cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions  or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical  regulatory or revenue based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations  amortization expense  and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if an impairment indicator exists  we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable  as discussed in note a  we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified 
in addition  we test our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets 
to test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  we write the carrying value down to the fair value 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group 
the use of alternative assumptions  including estimated cash flows  discount rates  and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment 
goodwill valuation we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill 
we test our april goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the assessment  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments  and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics 
for our april  annual impairment assessment  we identified six reporting units within the us  including our crm  neuromodulation  endoscopy  urology women s health  electrophysiology  and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises  which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment 
in addition  we identified four international reporting units  including emea  japan  asia pacific and the americas 
when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units  we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition 
in addition  for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test  assets and liabilities  including corporate assets  which relate to a reporting unit s operations  and would be considered in determining its fair value  are allocated to the individual reporting units 
we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit  but from which the reporting unit benefits  based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit 
during   and  we used only the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method  to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment 
this approach calculates fair value 
table of contents by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach 
therefore  we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill  we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets  long range strategic plans and other estimates 
the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable  perpetual growth of our reporting units 
we use estimates of market participant risk adjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate 
we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods  once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test 
although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests  these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated revenue projections  growth rates  cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates 
we continue to identify four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods 
these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit  which holds million of allocated goodwill  our us cardiovascular reporting unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  our us neuromodulation reporting unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  and our emea region  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  each as of december  as of the most recent annual assessment as of april  the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit  whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value ranged from approximately eight percent to percent 
on a quarterly basis  we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test 
the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates  levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions  as well as the wacc rate applied 
these assumptions are subject to uncertainty  including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels 
for each of these reporting units  relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions  including increases to the reporting unit carrying value  may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges 
for example  keeping all other variables constant  a basis point increase in the wacc applied to the reporting units  excluding acquisitions  would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit  and a basis point increase would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us neuromodulation  us cardiovascular and emea reporting units 
in addition  keeping all other variables constant  a basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit  and a basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us neuromodulation and emea reporting units 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we closely monitored these key variables and other factors and determined that we were not required to perform an interim impairment test 
the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management s best estimates  which we believe to be reasonable  but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill balance 
see note d goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for further discussion of our and goodwill impairment charges  as well as a discussion of future events that could have a negative impact on the fair value of these reporting units 
income taxes we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment 
table of contents is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit

such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results

additional information use of non gaap financial measures used by boston scientific to supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we disclose certain non gaap financial measures  including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts  and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these non gaap financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income per share 
to calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we convert actual net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period 
the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this non gaap financial measure is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis 
reconciliations of each of these non gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included elsewhere in this annual report 
management uses these supplemental non gaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period  to analyze the underlying trends in our business  to assess our performance relative to our competitors  and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources 
in addition  management uses these non gaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments 
the adjustments excluded from our non gaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of profit or loss 
these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance 
we believe that presenting adjusted net income  adjusted net income per share  and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management 
we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance 
the following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non gaap financial measures  as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges these amounts represent non cash net write downs of our goodwill balance attributable to our us cardiac rhythm management business  as well as certain intangible asset balances 
we remove the impact of these charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations 
we believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth 
therefore  these charges are excluded from management s assessment of operating performance and are 
table of contents also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation 
accordingly  we have excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance  particularly in terms of liquidity 
acquisition related credits charges these adjustments consist of a acquisition related gains on previously held equity interests  b contingent consideration fair value adjustments  c a gain on an acquisition related milestone receipt  d due diligence  other fees and exit costs  and e an inventory step up adjustment 
the acquisition related gains on previously held equity interests is a non recurring benefit associated with acquisitions completed in the first quarter of the contingent consideration adjustments are non cash charges representing accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value 
these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments 
the gain on an acquisition related milestone resulted from a receipt related to guidant corporation s sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to abbott laboratories  and is not indicative of future operating results 
due diligence  other fees and exit costs include legal  tax  severance and other expenses associated with prior acquisitions that are not representative of on going operations 
the inventory step up adjustment is a non cash charge related to acquired inventory directly attributable to prior acquisitions and is not indicative of our on going operations  or on going cost of products sold 
accordingly  we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
divestiture related credits charges these amounts represent a gains resulting from business divestitures and b fees and separation costs associated with business divestitures 
we completed the sale of our neurovascular business in january and the resulting gain is not indicative of future operating performance and is not used by management to assess operating performance 
fees and separation costs represent those associated with the divestiture of our neurovascular business and are not representative of on going operations 
accordingly  we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
restructuring and restructuring related costs these adjustments represent primarily severance  costs to transfer production lines from one facility to another  and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plan  restructuring plan  plant network optimization program and restructuring plan 
these expenses are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance  as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
accordingly  we excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
litigation related charges credits these amounts are primarily attributable to certain significant legal and product liability charges and gains 
these charges and gains are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance  as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
accordingly  we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
discrete tax items these items represent adjustments of certain tax positions  which were initially established in prior periods as a result of intangible asset impairment charges  acquisition  divestiture  restructuring or litigation related charges credits 
these adjustments do not reflect expected on going operating results 
accordingly  we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
amortization expense amortization expense is a non cash charge and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement 
we remove the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations 
we believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth 
therefore  amortization expense is excluded from management s assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation 
accordingly  we have excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance  particularly in terms of liquidity 
regional and divisional revenue growth rates excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in foreign currency exchange rates the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict 
accordingly  we excluded the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating 
table of contents performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
adjusted net income  adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
further  other companies may calculate these non gaap financial measures differently than boston scientific does  which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes
