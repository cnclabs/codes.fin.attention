overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing novel small molecule therapeutics derived from our boron chemistry platform 
we have discovered  synthesized and developed seven molecules that are currently in development 
the productivity of our internal discovery capability has enabled us to generate a pipeline of both topical and systemic boron based compounds 
we have discovered seven product candidates that have reached development 
our lead product candidates include two topically administered dermatologic compounds tavaborole formerly referred to as an  an antifungal for the treatment of onychomycosis  and an  an anti inflammatory for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
in addition  we have discovered three additional compounds that we have out licensed for further development gsk  or gsk formerly referred to as an  a systemic antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by gram negative bacteria that is licensed to glaxosmithkline llc  or gsk  an for the treatment of an animal health indication that is licensed to eli lilly and company  or lilly and an  also referred to as scyx  for human african trypanosomiasis  or hat  which is licensed to drugs for neglected diseases initiative  or dndi 
our most advanced product candidate is tavaborole 
we initiated our phase clinical trials for tavaborole in the fourth quarter of and completed enrollment for one of these two trials in november and the other in december for an  we completed a phase b dose ranging trial in psoriasis in the second quarter of  a second phase b clinical trial in psoriasis in the second quarter of and a phase absorption trial in the third quarter of we also completed a phase a trial of an and an  our second topical anti inflammatory product candidate  in mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in the fourth quarter of in early  we completed two safety studies of an  as well 
given the positive outcome from our atopic dermatitis trial  the safety profile exhibited by an and the large unmet need in atopic dermatitis relative to psoriasis  we intend to focus our an development efforts on atopic dermatitis in the near future and defer the start of the phase trial for psoriasis 
in the second quarter of  we completed a phase trial of gsk  and achieved proof of concept as defined under our collaboration agreement with gsk 
in the third quarter of  gsk exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize gsk in the second quarter of  gsk initiated two phase trials of gsk in complicated urinary tract infections cuti and complicated intra abdominal infections ciai 
in march  gsk voluntarily discontinued certain of its current clinical trials of gsk due to a recently identified microbiological finding in a small number of patients in the phase b trial for the treatment of cuti 
while we believe the microbiological finding seen in the cuti study is not related to the safety of gsk  the potential to negatively impact efficacy led gsk to voluntarily discontinue that study as well as the phase b study in ciai and one of two phase studies in healthy volunteers 
gsk is in the process of obtaining and analyzing additional information from all enrolled subjects 

table of contents in addition to our three lead programs  we have two other clinical product candidates  an and an  which are backup compounds to tavaborole and an  respectively 
we also have two additional compounds we have licensed to partners an that is licensed to lilly for an animal health indication and an that is licensed to dndi for sleeping sickness 
in february  we entered into an exclusive license  development and commercialization agreement with schering corporation  or schering  for the development and worldwide commercialization of tavaborole 
pursuant to the agreement  schering paid us a million non refundable  non creditable upfront fee and assumed sole responsibility for development and commercialization of tavaborole 
in november  schering merged with merck co  inc  or merck  and in may  we entered into a mutual termination and release agreement with merck 
under this agreement we regained the exclusive worldwide rights to tavaborole  merck paid us million and we released each other from any and all claims  liabilities or other types of obligations under the agreement 
merck did not retain any rights to this compound 
in october  we entered into a research and development collaboration  option and license agreement with gsk for the discovery  development and worldwide commercialization of boron based systemic anti infectives against four discovery targets 
pursuant to the agreement  gsk paid us a million non refundable  non creditable upfront fee in october in addition  gsk was obligated to make payments to us if certain development  regulatory and commercial events occurred on a compound by compound basis and was further obligated to pay us tiered double digit royalties with the potential to reach the mid teens on annual net sales of products containing optioned compounds in jurisdictions where there is a valid patent claim covering composition of matter or method of use of the product and lesser royalties for sales in jurisdictions where there is no such valid patent claim 
such royalties shall continue until the later of expiration of such valid patent claims or ten years from the first commercial sale on a product by product and country by country basis 
gsk also invested million in our preferred stock financing completed in december subsequently  in november  gsk invested an additional million in our common stock in connection with our initial public offering  or ipo 
from execution of the agreement through december   in addition to the million upfront payment received in october and the million upfront payment received in september  or amendment fee  we have received million for achievement of specified milestones  including milestones related to gsk for lead declaration  candidate selection  first patient dosing in a clinical trial and for gsk s exercise of its option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize gsk gsk has assumed responsibility for further development of gsk and any resulting commercialization 
in september  we amended our research and development collaboration with gsk  the master amendment  to  among other things  give effect to certain rights in gsk that would be acquired by the us government in connection with gsk s contract for government funding to support gsk s further development of gsk  provide gsk the option to extend its rights around the bacterial enzyme target leucyl trna synthetase  or leurs  as well as to add new research programs using our boron chemistry platform for tuberculosis  or tb  and malaria and  should gsk elect to initiate it  an additional collaborative research program directed toward leurs 
as a result of the master amendment  we received a million amendment fee 
we may also receive additional milestone payments  bonus payments and research funding from gsk in the future 
all such milestone payments  bonus payments and research funding  once earned  would be non refundable and non creditable 
we are also eligible to earn royalties on future sales of resulting products 
the master amendment terminated all previous activities under the original agreement  except gsk s activities related to gsk  which was licensed by gsk in july under the original agreement 
gsk retained sole responsibility for the further development and commercialization of gsk and will continue to be obligated to make bonus payments to us  if certain development and regulatory events occur and if certain sales levels for this drug are achieved  and to pay us royalties on annual net sales 
table of contents of gsk any future payment obligations of gsk with respect to the terminated activities under the original agreement  other than those related to gsk  were terminated and all rights to the compounds developed as a result of such terminated activities  except those meeting specified criteria  reverted to us 
the master amendment also terminated any research and development obligations that we had with respect to the original agreement 
on january   we adopted an accounting standard update that amended the guidance on accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables and included new guidance regarding how to apply the standard to arrangements that are materially modified following adoption of the update 
accordingly  we evaluated the terms of the september master amendment to our research and development collaboration with gsk relative to the entire arrangement and determined the master amendment to be a material modification to the original agreement for financial reporting purposes see note to the financial statements 
in analyzing this material modification  we determined that there were no undelivered elements remaining from the original agreement as of the effective date of the master amendment and that the only undelivered element resulting from the master amendment  other than contingent deliverables  was the research services we are obligated to provide under the new tb program 
we also determined that the contractually agreed rates for the tb program research funding to be received from gsk approximates the fair value of the tb research services and concluded  therefore  that the research funding rates were the best estimate selling price  or besp  for the tb research services 
therefore  the estimated research funding still to be received from gsk for these services would be sufficient to ensure the besp amount is available for future revenue recognition 
we then deducted the besp amount from the sum of i consideration currently committed to be received under the master amendment  including the tb research funding and the million amendment fee and ii million in deferred revenue remaining from the original agreement as of the effective date of the master amendment and recognized the remainder of million as revenue on the september modification date 
we also determined that the adoption of the new accounting standard  and its guidance related to material modifications of arrangements  had a material impact on the revenues we recognized from our collaboration with gsk 
we recognized revenues from gsk of million for the year ended december   and determined that the revenues for the same period would have been million if the gsk agreement  as modified by the master amendment  were still subject to the revenue recognition standards for multiple element arrangements that were in effect prior to january  in august  we entered into a collaboration agreement with lilly  under which the companies are collaborating to discover products for a variety of animal health applications 
lilly will be responsible for worldwide development and commercialization of compounds advancing from these efforts 
we received a non refundable  non creditable upfront payment of million in september and will receive a minimum of million in research funding with the potential of up to million in research funding if successful 
in addition  we will be eligible to receive payments upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones  as well as tiered royalties escalating from high single digit to in the tens royalties on sales  depending in part upon the mix of products sold 
in september  we received a million payment from lilly upon the achievement of a development milestone 
in february  we entered into a collaboration agreement with medicis 
we received a million upfront payment and are primarily responsible for discovering and conducting early development of product candidates that utilize our proprietary boron chemistry platform 
medicis will have an option to obtain an exclusive license for products covered by the agreement 
we will be eligible for future payments of up to million for the achievement of specified research  development  regulatory and sales goals  as well as tiered royalties on sales of licensed products by medicis or its sublicensees 
medicis will be responsible for further development and commercialization of the licensed products on a worldwide basis 

table of contents we also have several collaborations with organizations that fund our research to leverage our boron chemistry to discover new treatments for neglected diseases 
in addition to potentially developing new therapies for the diseases  these collaborations provide us the potential benefits of expanding the chemical diversity of our boron compounds  understanding new properties of our boron compounds  receiving future incentives  such as the potential grant of a priority review voucher by the fda  and  ultimately if a drug is approved  potential revenue in some regions 
our collaboration partners include dndi to develop new therapeutics for hat  visceral leishmaniasis and chagas disease  mmv to develop compounds for the treatment of malaria  the institute for oneworld health to discover antibacterial compounds for treating diarrheal diseases and the sandler center for drug discovery at the university of california at san francisco to discover new drug therapies for the treatment of river blindness 
in  dndi completed pre clinical studies of an for hat and in march  an became the first compound from our neglected diseases initiatives to enter human clinical trials 
we began business operations in march to date  we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have never been profitable 
as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of million 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments received under our agreements with schering  gsk  lilly and medicis  government contracts and grants  contracts with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases and borrowings under debt arrangements 
we expect to incur losses in future periods 
the size of our future losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth of our expenses  our ability to enter into additional licensing  research and development agreements and future payments earned under our agreements with gsk  lilly  medicis or any such future collaboration partners 
our intent is to enter into additional licensing and development agreements to further develop certain of our product candidates and to fund other areas of our research 
if the gsk  lilly and or medicis agreements are terminated or we are unable to enter into other collaboration agreements  we may incur additional operating losses and our ability to expand and continue our research and development activities and move our product candidates into later stages of development may be limited 
we will need to seek additional capital through collaborations  equity offerings and debt financings to fund our operations 
financial operations overview revenues our recent revenues are comprised primarily of collaboration agreement related revenues and government grants  while historically we also had government contract revenues 
collaboration agreement related revenues have included license fees  development reimbursements and development milestone fees 
in addition  we received the amendment fee in connection with our research and development collaboration with gsk  and a termination and release payment with respect to our previous agreement with schering 
government grant revenues have consisted of grant funding received from government entities and government contract revenues have included cost and cost plus fixed fee reimbursements for allowable costs 
we have generated approximately million in revenue from inception through december  through  we had recognized cumulative revenues of million through our contract with the us department of defense for the development of antibiotics against infective anthrax 
in september  we were awarded a million national institutes of health  or nih  grant for the identification of targets for certain antifungal compounds  which included work on the mechanism of action of tavaborole 
in march  we received from schering a million upfront fee that was recognized ratably over the estimated period during which we performed development related activities to transition tavaborole to schering 
the estimated period was based on the research transition plan jointly developed by schering and us 
in addition to the upfront fee  we were paid for our development related activities  which included certain preclinical and clinical activities 

table of contents inception to date  we have recognized revenue of million under the schering agreement  which was comprised of the full recognition of the million upfront fee and million for our development related transition activities 
in november  schering merged with merck and in may  upon termination of the agreement  we regained the exclusive worldwide rights to tavaborole and received a million payment from merck  which was recognized as revenue during in october  we received a million upfront fee under our agreement with gsk  which was being recognized ratably over the six year research term 
in september  the remaining million of deferred revenue was recognized upon the amendment of the contract 
through december   we recognized million under this agreement which was comprised of million related to the upfront fee  million for achievement of performance milestones  million for the amendment fee  million related to reimbursement for the tb program and million in reimbursement for patent costs  procurement of drug material and performance of certain clinical studies for gsk in the future  revenue under our agreement with gsk may include fees for our gsk product candidates achieving specified development  regulatory and sales goals and product royalties 
in september  we received a non creditable  non refundable upfront fee of million under our agreement with lilly  which we are recognizing over the four year research term on a straight line basis 
under this agreement  we will receive a minimum of million in research funding with the potential of up to million in research funding  if successful 
through december   we have recognized million under this agreement  which was comprised of million related to the upfront fee  million in research funding and million for achievement of a development milestone 
in october  we were awarded million from the united states department of the treasury under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program to support research for six projects with the potential to produce new therapies 
the full amount was recognized as government grant revenue in in february  we received a non creditable  non refundable upfront fee of million under our agreement with medicis  which we are recognizing over the six year research term on a straight line basis 
through december   we have recognized million of the upfront fee 
from inception through december   we have recognized million of revenue for research relating to animal health indications and for research performed under our agreements with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
research and development expenses  including those paid to third parties  are recognized as incurred 
research and development expenses include external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  contract research organizations and investigational sites  employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and consulting fees  third party supplier expenses  and 
table of contents facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  amortization or depreciation of leasehold improvements  equipment and laboratory supplies and other expenses 
our expenses associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of the services provided and the status of the related activities 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase significantly in the future as we progress our product candidates through clinical development  conduct our research and development activities under our agreements with gsk  lilly  medicis and various current and potential collaborations  including those related to our neglected diseases initiatives  advance our discovery research projects into the preclinical stage and continue our early stage research 
the table below sets forth our research and development expenses for  and  and for the period from january  through december   for four of our clinical stage product candidates  other work conducted under the gsk agreement  work on our lilly and medicis collaborations and work on neglected diseases and other programs  including programs that are currently inactive 
prior to january   we did not separately track expenses for tavaborole or any other product candidates due to the early stage of their development 
a portion of our research and development costs  including indirect costs relating to our product candidates  are not tracked on a program by program basis and are allocated based on the personnel resources assigned to each program 
total from january  to december  year ended december  in thousands tavaborole  including nih grant expenses an an gsk programs gsk other gsk programs lilly programs medicis program neglected diseases other programs total research and development expenses we expect our research and development expenses to increase in future periods 
our costs associated with tavaborole will increase as we will conduct additional clinical trials  in addition to concluding our phase trials  and will perform additional regulatory activities in preparation for filing our nda 
we expect costs associated with an to increase as we expand the clinical and preclinical activities for this program 
due to the option exercise by gsk for gsk in july  gsk has assumed all future development costs for this product candidate and therefore our expenses associated with gsk are expected to be minimal in the future 
we also expect costs associated with our early stage research activities on our lilly and medicis collaborations to increase in future periods 
in addition  spending for our early stage research programs  including our new gsk tb program and other potential gsk programs  will be dependent upon our success in developing and advancing new product candidates for these programs 
we cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if  when  or to what extent we will generate revenues from 
table of contents the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
we or our collaboration partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates 
the duration  costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors  including the uncertainties of future clinical and preclinical studies  uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates and significant and changing government regulation and whether our current or future collaborators are committed to and make progress in programs licensed to them 
for example  the timing to complete development of gsk will be controlled by gsk because they have exercised their option to license this product candidate 
in addition  the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors  including competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
consequently  we are unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the period in which material cash inflows will be received 
we will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an assessment of each product candidate s commercial potential 
our strategy includes entering into additional collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
to the extent that such third parties have control over preclinical development or clinical trials for some of our product candidates  we will be dependent upon their efforts for the progress of such product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel  including stock based compensation and travel expenses  in executive  finance  business development and other administrative functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  consulting costs associated with financial services  professional fees for legal services  including patent related expenses  and auditing and tax services 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our operating activities  hire additional staff and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition  preclinical study and clinical trial accruals  deferred advance payments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of our financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our contract revenues are generated primarily through research and development collaboration agreements  which typically may include non refundable  non creditable upfront fees  funding for research and development efforts  payments for achievement of specified development  regulatory and sales goals and royalties on product sales of licensed products 
for multiple element arrangements  we evaluate the components of each arrangement as separate elements based on certain criteria 
where multiple deliverables are combined as a single unit of accounting  revenues are recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  transfer of technology has been completed  services are performed or products have been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
on january   we adopted an accounting standard update that amends the guidance on accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this update requires that each deliverable be evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has stand alone value to the customer 
this update also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining how to allocate arrangement consideration to identified units of accounting 
the selling price used for each unit of accounting will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific nor third party evidence is available 
our management may be required to exercise considerable judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting and in estimating the selling prices of identified units of accounting for new agreements 
the update also provided new guidance regarding how to apply the standard to arrangements that are materially modified following adoption of the update and our adoption of the update had a material impact on the revenues we recognized for the year ended december  as a result of the amended guidance being applied to a material modification of our collaboration agreement with gsk in september the potential future impact of the adoption of this update will depend on the nature of any new arrangements entered into or material modifications of existing arrangements 
upfront payments for licensing our intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the licensee can obtain stand alone value from the license separate from the value of the research and development services to be provided by us 
typically  we have determined that the licenses we have granted to collaborators do not have stand alone value separate from the value of the research and development services provided 
as such  upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and are recognized as contract revenue over the contractual or estimated performance period that is consistent with the term of the research and development obligations contained in the research and development collaboration agreement 
when stand alone value is identified  the related consideration is recorded as revenue in the period in which the license or other intellectual property rights are issued 
some arrangements involving the licensing of our intellectual property  the provision of research and development services or both may also include exclusivity clauses whereby we agree that  for a specified period of time  we will not conduct further research on licensed compounds or on compounds that would compete with licensed compounds or that we will do so only on a limited basis 
such provisions may also restrict the future development or commercialization of such compounds 
we do not treat such exclusivity clauses as a separate element within an arrangement and any upfront payments received related to the exclusivity clause would be allocated to the identified elements in the arrangement and recognized as described in the preceding paragraph 
payments resulting from our efforts under research and development agreements or government grants are recognized as the activities are performed and are presented on a gross basis 
revenue is recorded gross because we act as a principal  with discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and 
table of contents perform part of the services 
the costs associated with these activities are reflected as a component of research and development expense in our statements of operations and approximate the amount of revenue recognized 
also on january   we adopted an accounting standard update that provides guidance on revenue recognition using the milestone method 
this update established the milestone method as an acceptable method of revenue recognition for certain contingent payments under research or development arrangements 
under the milestone method  a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is an event i that can be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to us 
the determination that a milestone is substantive is judgmental and is made at the inception of the arrangement 
milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is i commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relates solely to past performance and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
we have historically applied a milestone method approach to our research and development arrangements  so the prospective adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
other contingent payments received for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the results of a collaboration partner s performance bonus payments are not accounted for using the milestone method 
such bonus payments will be recognized as revenue when earned and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties based on reported sales of licensed products will be recognized based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  none of our products have been approved and therefore we have not earned any royalty revenue from product sales 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals and deferred advance payments we estimate preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct these activities on our behalf 
in recording service fees  we estimate the time period over which the related services will be performed and compare the level of effort expended through the end of each period to the cumulative expenses recorded and payments made for such services and  as appropriate  accrue additional service fees or defer any non refundable advance payments until the related services are performed 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust our accrual or deferred advance payment accordingly 
if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
to date  we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial accruals 
stock based compensation employee stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period 
stock option awards granted to our nonemployee directors for their board related services are included in employee stock based compensation in accordance with current accounting standards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock based 
table of contents awards and use the straight line single option method for expense attribution 
we estimate forfeitures and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
we account for equity instruments issued to nonemployees based on their fair values on the measurement dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair values of the options granted to nonemployees are remeasured as they vest 
as a result  the noncash charge to operations for nonemployee options with vesting is affected each reporting period by changes in the fair value of our common stock 
we recorded noncash stock based compensation for employee and nonemployee stock option grants and espp stock purchase rights of million  million and million during   and  respectively 
as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase  shares of our common stock and had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  related to outstanding stock options and million related to espp stock purchase rights that will be recognized over weighted average periods of and years  respectively 
there were  common shares purchased under the espp for the year ended december  we expect to continue to grant stock options and espp stock purchase rights in the future  which will increase our stock based compensation expense in future periods 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease contract revenue government grant revenue research and development expenses general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense loss of early extinguishment of debt other income expense includes the following stock based compensation expenses research and development expenses general and administrative expenses 
table of contents contract revenue 
during  we recognized the remaining million of the upfront fee received from gsk in  of which million was recognized as a result of the material modification of our gsk arrangement in september  an additional million amendment fee related to the additional rights provided to gsk under the master amendment and million for funding of our tb research activities and patent costs 
we also recognized million for research funding  million for a development milestone earned and million of the upfront fee received under the lilly agreement 
additionally  we recognized million of the upfront fee received under the medicis agreement for the research services performed during the year and million for work performed under other research and development agreements  including our agreements with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases 
during  we recognized million for a development milestone earned under the collaboration with gsk  million of revenue for reimbursement of patent and clinical costs related to gsk and million of the upfront fee received from gsk in we also recognized revenue in for the million payment that we received from merck upon the termination of the schering license agreement 
in addition  we recognized million for research funding and million of the upfront fee under the lilly agreement and million of revenue for work we performed under research and development agreements  including under agreements with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases 
government grant revenue 
during  we recognized the full million of the qualifying therapeutic discovery project grant funds awarded to us in october by the united states department of the treasury for eligible investments we made in six of our projects during and research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses for compared to was primarily due to the increases in manufacturing  development and clinical trial activities  which caused our expenses for tavaborole  an and an to increase by million  million and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated our phase trials for tavaborole and completed enrollment of approximately  patients during during this period  we were also manufacturing  packaging and labeling our clinical supplies for these trials and beginning our work to develop processes to manufacture the product in commercial quantities 
in contrast  while we began manufacturing clinical supplies and planning for our phase clinical trials in the second half of  most of the activity in the first half of that year was administrative in nature 
as such  tavaborole expenses were significantly higher in than in for an  our activities during consisted of enrolling patients and completing both our phase b clinical trial in psoriasis  our phase trial in atopic dermatitis and phase absorption trial  initiating two safety trials and conducting preclinical studies 
this compared to fewer an related activities in  which consisted of conducting our initial phase trial for an  completing preclinical studies and initiating manufacturing activities in anticipation of starting additional preclinical studies and clinical trials 
our activities in for an consisted of enrolling patients in and completing our phase trial in atopic dermatitis  manufacturing clinical supplies and conducting preclinical studies  which resulted in an increase in an expenses compared to  during which our an related activities were limited 
for compared to  our research and development spending also increased by million and million under our contracts with lilly and medicis  respectively 
our collaboration with lilly was initiated in august and our collaboration with medicis commenced in february in addition  spending on our neglected diseases initiatives increased by million in compared to the increases in expenses for our tavaborole  an and an programs and for the lilly and medicis collaborations were partially offset by decreases of million and million in spending for 
table of contents gsk and our other gsk programs  respectively 
in  we were conducting the phase clinical trial for gsk at our own expense  whereas gsk is now solely responsible for expenditures related to gsk following their licensing of the compound in july in  our activities on the other gsk programs were reduced compared to due to the cessation of further development of compounds under these programs 
our efforts on our internal early stage research projects decreased by million in as compared with as we redirected our internal resources towards our collaborative efforts with medicis and lilly 
our neglected diseases program expenses for increased by million compared to as our efforts and funding on certain of these initiatives increased 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as a result of increased development and clinical trial activity associated with our lead programs and our continued efforts under our collaborations with gsk  lilly and medicis and for our neglected diseases initiatives 
in particular  our clinical trial expenses will increase due to the initiation of additional clinical trials and the conduct of our phase trial activities for tavaborole 
general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for as compared with was primarily due to the higher costs of operating as a public company 
our professional accounting and finance consulting fees  legal fees  board of directors compensation  directors and officers insurance and investor relations expenses all increased 
we also added additional staff in the latter part of  including our chief financial officer 
our noncash stock compensation expenses and consulting fees also increased for as compared to these increases were only partially offset by lower patent related legal fees as we allowed certain of our patents to lapse 
interest income

other income expense

government grant revenue 
during  we recognized the full million of the qualifying therapeutic discovery project grant funds awarded to us in october by the united states department of the treasury for eligible investments we made in six of our projects during and research and development expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses for compared to was primarily due to decreases of million and million in our other gsk programs and gsk  respectively 
in the latter part of  we redirected some of our resources away from our early stage gsk programs to focus our efforts more on gsk this led to the reduction in spending on the other gsk programs in in  we were in the midst of multiple development activities for gsk whereas during  our activities were limited to conducting the phase clinical trial for this compound 
furthermore  gsk became solely responsible for expenditures related to gsk following their licensing of gsk in july these two factors resulted in an overall reduction in gsk expenses from to our gsk program spending decreases were partially offset by increases of million  million and million in our tavaborole  an and other research programs  respectively 
due to merck notifying us in january that they were terminating our licensing agreement with 
table of contents schering  we were actively transitioning tavaborole materials and documents from schering back to us during  as well as preparing to initiate the phase clinical trials  which commenced in the fourth quarter of in contrast  during the prior year  we were winding down our tavaborole development work in anticipation of schering beginning phase trials later that year 
during  we were conducting our first phase b trial for an  completing some preclinical studies and initiating manufacturing activities in anticipation of starting additional preclinical studies and our final phase b clinical trial for an in psoriasis 
this caused us to incur higher expenses for an in than during when we were winding down our initial phase b clinical trial and initiating startup activities for our final phase b trial in psoriasis 
our efforts on our internal early stage research projects increased during as compared to with increased expenses of million for animal health related research  under our collaboration with lilly  and million more for other early stage research projects 
general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in the as compared to was primarily due to higher stock based compensation expenses  increased fees for audit services and an increase in bonus expenses as we achieved a higher percentage of our corporate goals in than in these increases were only partially offset by lower corporate legal expenses 
interest income 
the decrease in interest income was due to the reduction in investment balances and lower yields 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased in due to the lower outstanding balance on our debt and the increase in the term over which we were amortizing the final payment to lighthouse and debt discounts as a result of our january loan restructuring 
this decrease was partially offset by additional interest expenses associated with the january loan restructuring in the form of accrued interest for the loan modification fee and amortization of the additional debt discount associated with the new warrant issued at that time 
other income expense 
the increase in other income expense in compared to reflected the net post issuance reduction in the fair values of our preferred stock warrants during in contrast with when the fair values of these warrants increased 
income taxes at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of million 
our utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
we have determined that an ownership change  as defined by internal revenue code section  occurred in december however  the computed annual limitation is not expected to prevent us from utilizing our net operating losses prior to their expiration if we can generate sufficient taxable income to do so in the future 
we recorded a valuation allowance to offset in full the benefit related to the deferred tax assets because realization of this benefit was uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through our ipo in november  private placements of equity securities  funding from our agreements with schering  gsk  lilly and medicis  government contract and grant funding and debt arrangements 
we have also earned interest on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 

table of contents the following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented below in thousands year ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was million and million during and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities for primarily reflected our net loss adjusted for noncash items  partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities  including the amortization of the remaining balance of the upfront fee received from gsk upon the amendment of the contract and the increase in accrued liabilities due to our external development and clinical trial activities 
net cash from operations was also positively impacted by the receipt of the million amendment fee from gsk upon the execution of the master amendment of the research and development collaboration and by the million upfront payment received from medicis  which resulted in an increase of million in deferred revenue related to the medicis contract 
the net cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from our net loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities  including an increase in accrued liabilities due to increased preclinical and clinical activities late in the year and payment of liabilities arising from our ipo 
cash used in operating activities was also positively affected by the million payment received from gsk and the million received from merck upon termination of our license agreement for tavaborole  both of which contributed to the lower net loss for the period 
in addition  cash used in operating activities for this period was also positively impacted by the million upfront payment received from lilly  which resulted in a million increase in deferred revenue related to our lilly contract 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the net cash provided by investing activities for was primarily related to the proceeds from the maturities of investments offset by our purchases of investments 
for  the net cash used by investing activities was primarily the result of the purchases of short term investments as we invested the net proceeds from our ipo and our concurrent private placement 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for compared with million for the cash provided by financing activities for was primarily due to the million borrowing under our new loan facility with oxford and horizon  partially offset by the million we paid for the regularly scheduled principal payments and early extinguishment of our remaining obligations under our lighthouse loan facility 
the net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily a result of our ipo and concurrent private placement of common stock which raised a combined million partially offset by million in principal payments on our notes payable and a loan restructuring fee payment of million to lighthouse 
in february  we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  the underwriters were granted a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock to cover over allotments  if any 
we believe that our existing capital resources including the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in february and the remaining million of borrowing capacity under our loan facility with oxford and horizon will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial 
table of contents resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors  including the initiation  progress  timing  costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates and potential product candidates  including conduct of phase clinical trials for tavaborole and initiation and conduct of phase and phase clinical trials for an  the success of our collaborations with gsk  lilly and medicis and the attainment of contingent event based payments and royalties  if any  under those agreements  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the terms and timing of any future collaboration  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  the outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the cost and timing of completion of commercial scale outsourced manufacturing activities  the cost of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies 
if  over the next several years  adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some  or all of  the above activities 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future years 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases notes payable total contractual obligations operating leases we lease a  square foot building in palo alto  california consisting of office and laboratory space which serves as our corporate headquarters 
the lease commenced in april and will terminate in march we also lease a  square foot building consisting of office and laboratory space in palo alto  california 
in october  we amended this lease to extend the term to december  in addition  we have two one year options to extend the lease through each of december  and the lease is cancelable with four months notice 

table of contents notes payable in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement  or loan agreement  with oxford and horizon  or the lenders  to provide up to million  available in three tranches 
the first million tranche was drawn on march   at which time we repaid million of the remaining obligations under our previous loan facility with lighthouse 
the second and third tranches of million each became available for drawdown upon our achieving full enrollment of the phase trial for tavaborole in december we borrowed million of the second tranche on december  and amended the loan agreement to revise the third tranche to borrow up to an additional million  which is available to us for drawdown through september  payments on the loan are interest only until april  followed by equal monthly payments of interest and principal through april  a final payment of million will be due on april  in connection with the first and second tranche drawdowns in  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock with an aggregate exercise price equal to million 
the warrants are immediately exercisable  may be exercised on a cashless basis and expire seven years from the issuance date 
we estimated the total fair value of these two warrants using the black scholes valuation model as of the issuance dates to be million  which was recorded as a debt discount to the notes payable 
if we borrow any portion of the third tranche  we will issue additional warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of our common stock equal to the number that results from dividing the lesser of  or of the amount drawn by the exercise price for the third tranche 
the aggregate proceeds from the exercise of all warrants issued to the lenders will not exceed million 
from january  to march   we made principal and interest payments to lighthouse totaling million prior to paying our remaining obligations of million from the proceeds of the first tranche borrowed under our new march loan and security agreement 
contracts we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical research studies  research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes 
these contracts generally provide for termination on notice  and therefore we believe that our non cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements  such as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  an amendment to an accounting standard was issued that amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some expanded disclosure requirements 
the most significant change is the disclosure information required for level measurements based on unobservable inputs 
this standard will become effective for us on january  and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  a new accounting standard was issued that eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  an entity will be required to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
in december  another amendment to defer certain requirements from the june guidance was issued that relates to the presentation of classification adjustments 
this standard became effective retrospectively for us on january  as this standard relates only to the presentation of other comprehensive income  the adoption of this accounting standard is not expected to significantly impact our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of high credit quality securities  including us government instruments  commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our investment policy prohibits us from holding auction rate securities or derivative financial instruments 
to the extent that the investment portfolios of companies whose commercial paper is included in our investment portfolio may be subject to interest rate risks  which could be negatively impacted by reduced liquidity in auction rate securities or derivative financial instruments they hold  we may also be subject to these risks 
however  our investments as of december  are comprised of u 
s treasury securities  federal agency securities with a minimum rating of aaa or a  and us government guaranteed corporate debt securities with a remaining average maturity of the entire portfolio of days 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk and we are not aware of any material exposure to market risk
