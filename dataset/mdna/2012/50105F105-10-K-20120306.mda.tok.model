metric tons in thousands item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations business overview we are a leading global producer and marketer of value added tio tio is used for a variety of manufacturing applications  including plastics  paints  paper and other industrial products 
during  approximately one half of our sales volumes were sold into european markets 
we believe we are the largest producer of tio in europe with an estimated share of european tio sales volumes in in addition  we estimate we have a share of north american tio sales volumes in our production facilities are located throughout europe and north america 
we consider tio to be a quality of life product  with demand affected by gross domestic product  or gdp  and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world 
over the long term  we expect demand for tio will grow by to per year  consistent with our expectations for the long term growth in gdp 
however  even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market  demand for tio in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in gdp  in part due to relative changes in the tio inventory levels of our customers 
we believe that our customers inventory levels are influenced in part by their expectation for future changes in market tio selling prices as well as their expectation for future availability of product 
although certain of our tio 

grades are considered specialty pigments  the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigment products with price and availability being the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service 
the factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are our tio sales and production volumes  tio selling prices  currency exchange rates particularly the exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the euro  the norwegian krone and the canadian dollar and manufacturing costs  particularly raw materials  maintenance and energy related expenses 
our key performance indicators are our tio average selling prices and our level of tio sales and production volumes 
tio 

selling prices generally follow industry trends and prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures

critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the recoverability of long lived assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ significantly from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements long lived assets we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements of accounting standard codification  or asc  topic property  plant and equipment and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
we do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators specified in asc topic are present 
we did not evaluate any long lived assets for impairment during because no such impairment indicators were present 
benefit plans we maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions  or opeb  plans 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and opeb costs are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
at december   we have concluded that no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized with respect to such carryforwards  principally because i such carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period  ii we have utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three year period and iii we currently expect to utilize the remainder of such carryforwards over the 
table of contents long term 
however  prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  if we were to generate losses in our german operations for an extended period of time  it is possible that we might conclude the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point we would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against some or all of the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our tax positions will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
it is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made 
in addition  we evaluate at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non us subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were to be distributed to the us contingencies we record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
income from operations is impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  such as allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investments and long lived assets  defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals 
in addition  net income is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals

global customer demand for our tio products also remained strong in nevertheless  we experienced a softening of demand in the fourth quarter as a result of customer destocking  and our sales volumes in were lower as compared to  with most of the lower volumes occurring in the fourth quarter 
we anticipate that customer demand will rebound from the softness experienced in the fourth quarter  and that we will be able to implement further tio 

selling price increases 
we experienced increased costs for our raw materials such as ore and petroleum coke in we expect further increases in raw material costs in overall  based on positive market dynamics in the tio industry  we expect our profitability and cash flows to increase in and the foreseeable future 
net sales net sales increased or million in compared to  primarily due to a increase in average tio selling prices 
tio selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures  changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs 
based on current conditions in the tio industry  as well as the expectation for increases in our manufacturing costs discussed below  we currently expect average selling prices in to be higher than in while the amount of inventory available for shipment in increased due to higher production volumes during the year  our sales volumes were lower than in as a result of soft demand in the fourth quarter of due to customer destocking 

table of contents in addition to the factors discussed above  we estimate the favorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates increased our net sales by approximately million  or  as compared to  while relative changes in mix of the various grades of our products sold decreased our net sales by approximately million  or 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million or in compared to due to the net impact of a increase in tio production volumes  higher raw material costs of million primarily feedstock ore and petroleum coke  an increase in maintenance costs of million consistent with the increase in production volumes and currency fluctuations primarily the euro 
overall  our per metric ton cost of tio we produced increased approximately as compared to cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to in compared to in primarily due to the effects of higher selling prices and the benefit of higher production volumes in our tio 

production volumes in established a new record for us for an annual production period 
we currently expect our feedstock ore and our other raw material costs to increase in  including significant increases in our feedstock ore costs 
income from operations income from operations increased by million from million in to million in income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this increase is driven by the improvement in gross margin  which increased to in compared to in our gross margin increased primarily because of the effect of higher selling prices which more than offset the impact of higher manufacturing costs primarily raw materials and maintenance 
changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal effect on our income from operations in as compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at approximately and for and respectively 
other non operating income expense in march  we redeemed million principal amount of our senior secured notes 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we repurchased in open market transactions an aggregate million principal amount of our notes 
we recognized a net million pre tax interest charge related to the redemption and open market purchases of the notes  consisting of the call premium  the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the redeemed and purchased notes 
interest expense decreased million from million in to million in due to the net effects of the prepayment and open market purchases of a portion of the senior secured notes as discussed above  and changes in currency exchange rates 
the interest expense we recognize will vary with fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
income tax provision our income tax provision was million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to our increased earnings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 

table of contents our income tax provision in includes million for us incremental income taxes on current earnings repatriated from our german subsidiary  which earnings were used to fund a portion of the redemption and repurchases of our senior secured notes 
our income tax provision in includes a million non cash income tax benefit related to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards

in addition  we estimate the unfavorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately million  or  as compared to the same period in record sales volumes in increased as compared to due to higher demand across all market segments resulting from the improvement in current economic conditions 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million or in compared to due to the net impact of a increase in tio production volumes to  metric tons  a increase in sales volumes  an increase in maintenance costs of million  and higher raw material costs of million 
in addition  cost of sales for was negatively impacted by approximately million as a result of higher production costs in at our ilmenite mines in norway 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
table of contents decreased to in compared to in primarily due to higher selling prices in and the significantly higher production volumes in  as we implemented temporary plant curtailments during the first half of in order to reduce our finished goods inventories to an appropriate level 
such temporary plant curtailments resulted in approximately million of unabsorbed fixed production costs which were charged directly to cost of sales in the first six months of income loss from operations income loss from operations increased by million from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in income loss from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this increase is driven by the improvement in gross margin  which increased to for compared to for our gross margin increased primarily because of higher sales volumes  higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs per ton resulting from higher production volumes 
however  changes in currency exchange rates negatively affected our gross margin and income loss from operations 
we estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased income loss from operations by approximately million in as compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at approximately and for and respectively 
interest expense interest expense decreased million from million in to million in due to decreased average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
the interest expense we recognize will vary with fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
income tax provision benefit our income tax provision was million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax provision in includes a million non cash income tax benefit related to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
our income tax benefit for includes a non cash benefit of million related to a net decrease in our reserve for uncertain tax positions  primarily as a result of the resolution of tax audits in belgium and germany in the third and fourth quarters 
effects of currency exchange rates we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
the majority of our sales from non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations is denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials used worldwide  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are purchased primarily in local currencies 

table of contents consequently  the translated us dollar value of our us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
in addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time  our non us operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non local currency sales or operating costs are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non local currency 
overall  we estimate that fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our sales and income loss from operations for the periods indicated 
impact of changes in currency exchange rates vs 
transaction gains losses recognized translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs 
change in millions impact on net sales income from operations impact of changes in currency exchange rates vs 
transaction gains losses recognized translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs 
change in millions impact on net sales income loss from operations the impact on income from operations in versus was minimal 
the negative impact on income loss from operations in versus is due to increased currency transaction losses in as compared to which were a function of the timing of currency exchange rate changes and the settlement of non local currency receivables and payables 
outlook we operated our production facilities at full practical capacity levels during and our production volumes in set a new record for us for the second year in a row 
while we will continue to work on debottlenecking projects in order to increase our production capacity  we believe such debottlenecking projects will produce relatively nominal increases in our capacity 
given the exceptional level of production achieved in  we currently expect to operate our facilities in at production levels consistent with or slightly lower than the overall strong global demand for tio we experienced in is expected to continue in as a result  we expect that we will be able to sell the tio we produce in as well as portions of our finished goods inventory on hand at the end of consequently  we expect our sales volumes to increase in as compared to 
table of contents we implemented significant increases in tio 

selling prices throughout our average tio selling prices were higher in as compared to  and our average prices at the end of were higher than at the end of the third quarter of and higher than at the end of based on the expected continuation of strong demand levels and increases in our manufacturing costs discussed below  we anticipate our average selling prices will continue to increase throughout  including increases to offset the impact of our expected higher manufacturing costs 
throughout we have seen significantly higher feedstock ore costs driven by tight ore supplies and higher than historical increases in petroleum coke and energy costs 
we currently expect this trend to continue in  with continued higher than historical increases in feedstock ore  petroleum coke  energy and freight costs 
overall  we currently expect the per metric ton cost of tio we produce will increase approximately to in as compared to primarily due to higher feedstock ore costs 
our cost of sales per metric ton of tio sold in is consequently expected to be significantly higher as compared to  but only after we have sold the tio products on hand at the end of  the cost of which is significantly lower than our expected production costs 
given the current conditions in the tio industry  if our costs of production exceed our current expectations in and demand for tio remains strong  we believe we could recoup such higher costs through additional selling price increases 
overall  we expect income from operations will be higher in as compared to  as the favorable effect of higher selling prices and sales volumes will more than offset the impact of higher production costs 
our expectations as to the future of the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond our control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  continued operation of competitors  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions or reductions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities trends in cash flows as a result of our operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in our earnings 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million in this million increase was primarily due to the net effects of the following items higher income from operations in of million  higher net cash used by increases in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in  primarily due to relative changes in our inventory level  as discussed below  
table of contents higher cash paid for income taxes in of million resulting from our increased profitability  higher net distributions from our tio joint venture in of million due to related changes in their cash requirements and lower cash paid for interest in of million  primarily due to lower average borrowings in partially offset by the million call premium associated with the redemption of million of our senior secured notes

changes in working capital are affected by accounts receivable and inventory changes 
as shown below our average days sales outstanding has been consistent over the past three years as a result of consistent timing of collections on receivable balances and our average days sales in inventory increased at december  compared to december   as our tio production volumes in exceeded our sales volumes by approximately  metric tons due to the exceptional level of our production volumes in and soft demand in the fourth quarter of for comparative purposes  we have provided prior year numbers below

table of contents in february  our board of directors declared a first quarter regular quarterly dividend of 
per share  payable on march  to stockholders of record as of march  outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability at december   our consolidated debt comprised million principal amount of our senior secured notes million due in april and approximately million of other indebtedness 
certain of our credit agreements contain provisions which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness prior to their stated maturity for reasons other than defaults for failure to comply with applicable covenants 
for example  certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined in the agreement of the borrower 
in addition  certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to the million principal amount outstanding at december  of our senior secured notes due in april  as noted above we redeemed million principal amount and repurchased in open market transactions million principal amount of such notes during we may redeem or repurchase additional senior secured notes prior to their maturity date  and we expect any amounts remaining after such possible redemption or repurchase would be refinanced before their maturity date 
in addition to the outstanding indebtedness indicated above  at december  we have our million european credit facility  for which no amounts were outstanding and the equivalent of million was available for borrowing by our european subsidiaries 
in december  our canadian subsidiary entered into a cdn 
million loan agreement with the bank of montreal for the limited purpose of issuing letters of credit 
the facility renews annually 
letters of credit are collateralized by restricted deposits at the bank of montreal million at december  
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  restrict the subsidiary from incurring additional indebtedness in excess of cdn 
million 
at december   an aggregate of cdn 
million letters of credit were outstanding under this facility 
in february  an additional letter of credit was issued under this facility for cdn 
million 
our assets consist primarily of investments in operating subsidiaries  and our ability to service parent level obligations  including the senior secured notes  depends in large part upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations or otherwise 
none of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured notes  although kii has pledged of the common stock or other ownership interests of certain of kii s first tier operating subsidiaries as collateral for the senior secured notes 
the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes limits kii s ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments 
at december   the maximum amount of dividends and other restricted payments that kii could make the restricted payment basket was approximately million 

table of contents liquidity our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is cash flows from operating activities which is generally used to i fund working capital expenditures  ii repay any short term indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we will also from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business and use the proceeds to i repay existing indebtedness  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact earnings and operating cash flows 
changes in tio pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our dividend policy  our debt service  our capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in our subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of these steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
in the normal course of our business  we may investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the tio 

industry 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunity  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing our equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
at december   we had credit available under our european credit facility of approximately million 
at december   we could borrow such amount without violating any covenants in such facility 
we believe we will be able to comply with the financial covenants contained in such credit facility through its maturity  however if future operating results differ materially from our expectations we may be unable to maintain compliance 
based upon our expectation for the tio 

industry and anticipated demands on cash resources  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our short term obligations defined as the twelve month period ending december  and our long term obligations defined as the five year period ending december   our time period for long term budgeting 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
stock repurchase program in december our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock in open market transactions

to date  we have not made any repurchases under the plan and all million shares are available for repurchase 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures we intend to spend approximately million to maintain and improve our existing facilities during  including approximately million in the area of environmental compliance  protection and improvement 
the majority of our expenditures in will be to maintain and improve the cost effectiveness of our manufacturing facilities 
our capital expenditures in the area of environmental compliance  protection and improvement include expenditures which are primarily focused on increased operating efficiency but also result in improved environmental protection  such as lower emissions from our manufacturing plants 
capital spending for is expected to be funded through cash on hand or borrowing under existing credit facilities

we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchase  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
defined benefit pension plans we maintain various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
under defined benefit pension plan accounting  defined benefit pension plan expense and pension assets and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
we recognize the full funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as either an asset for overfunded plans or a liability for underfunded plans in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount 
table of contents of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us and will generally differ from pension expense for financial reporting purposes 
we made contributions to all of our plans which aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates we use for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate discount rates and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices 
we adjust these discount rates as of each december valuation date to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
we use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december of that year 
we also use these discount rates to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligations related to our plans in germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different discount rate assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligation and expense 
this is because we maintain defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in europe and north america and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
we used the following discount rates for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in germany canada norway us the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan  the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year and an estimate of the amount of contributions to and distributions from the plan during the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 

table of contents at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to our plans in the germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense 
this is because the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  we consider the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of our plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate long term rates of return 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below in germany  the composition of our plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
in canada  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
we expect the long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
in norway  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities  to real estate and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately   and  respectively 
in the us substantially all of the assets are invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold c 
simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt and is a member of the cmrt investment committee 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices  while utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
the cmrt holds timet common stock in its investment portfolio  however through december  we invested in a portion of the cmrt which does not include the timet holdings 
beginning in  we began to invest in the portion of the cmrt that holds such stock 
during the history of the cmrt from its inception in through december   the average annual rate of return including the cmrt s investment in timet common stock has been  while such annual return excluding the cmrt s investment in timet common stock has been 

table of contents our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows december  germany canada norway cmrt equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate other total december  germany canada norway cmrt equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate other total we regularly review our actual asset allocation for each non us plan and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the cmrt trustee and investment committee do not maintain a specific target asset allocation in order to achieve their objectives  but instead they periodically change the asset mix of the cmrt based upon  among other things  advice they receive from third party advisors and their expectations regarding potential returns for various investment alternatives and what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
our assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows germany canada norway us we currently expect to use the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as we used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of our plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  we generally base the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 

table of contents in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of net pension asset and net pension liability will vary based upon relative changes in currency exchange rates 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables  which are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality table themselves or plan amendments  will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
these amounts are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in addition  any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains 
during  all of our defined benefit pension plans generated a combined net actuarial loss of approximately million 
this actuarial loss resulted primarily from the general reduction in discount rates from december  to december  based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  we expect to be required to contribute approximately million to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if we had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all plans as of december   our aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date and our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if we lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of our plans  our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately 
million during opeb plans certain subsidiaries of ours in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under other postretirement employee benefits opeb accounting  opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
we recognize the full unfunded status of our opeb plans as a liability 

table of contents we recognized consolidated opeb cost of approximately 
million in  million in and 
million in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated 
million in  
million in and 
million in substantially all of our us accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current us employees 
some of our canadian employees are earning opeb benefits 
our expected opeb benefit payments for are expected to be similar amounts 
the discount rates we use for determining opeb expense and the related opeb obligations are based on current interest rates earned on high quality bond yields in the applicable country where the benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate discount rates  and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices 
we adjust these discount rates as of each valuation date to reflect then current interest rates on such bonds 
we use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the opeb obligations as of december of that year 
we also use these discount rates to determine the interest component of opeb expense for the following year 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider our actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  we have assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our consolidated opeb expense will approximate 
million in in comparison  we expect to be required to make approximately 
million of contributions to such plans during we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
a basis point change in assumed discount rates  or a one percent change in assumed health care trend rates  would not have a material effect on the net opeb cost for or on the accumulated opeb obligation at december  operations outside the united states as discussed above  we have substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of our assets and liabilities related to our non us operations  and therefore our consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   we had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar and norwegian krone 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  the majority of our aggregate indebtedness was comprised of fixed rate instruments 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility that would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for our aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  information shown below for such non us dollar denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using an exchange rate of us per euro

earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   we had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness at december  the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
certain of our sales generated by our non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with trade receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales 
we have not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor do we currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 

table of contents at december   we had currency forward contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates ranging from cdn 

to cdn 
per us dollar 
these contracts with wells fargo bank  national association  mature from january through december at a rate of million per month  subject to early redemption provisions at our option 
the estimated fair value of such currency forward contracts at december  was a 
million net liability  which amount is recognized as part of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding 
million currency transaction loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent we held such contracts during  and  we did not use hedge accounting for any of our contracts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
marketable security prices we are exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which we own 
the fair value of securities which includes investments in mutual funds and in publicly traded shares of related parties was million and million  respectively  at december  and december  the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and december  raw materials we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices relating to our raw materials 
as discussed in item we generally enter into long term supply agreements for certain of our raw material requirements including ore 
many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase  or specify a range of quantities within which we are required to purchase 
raw material pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly or semi annually depending upon the suppliers 
for certain raw material requirements we do not have long term supply agreements either because we have assessed the risk of the unavailability of those raw materials and or the risk of a significant change in the cost of those raw materials to be low  or because long term supply agreements for those raw materials are generally not available 
other we believe there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in exchange rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect our results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for our products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses we would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in exchange rates were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates 
actual future market conditions will likely differ 
table of contents materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by us of future events  gains or losses
