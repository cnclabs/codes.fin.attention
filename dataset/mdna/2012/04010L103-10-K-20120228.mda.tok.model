for risks relating to our equity investments  see risk factors risks relating to our investments investments in equity securities  many of which are illiquid with no readily available market  involve a substantial degree of risk 
ares capital management llc  our investment adviser  employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments 
in addition to various risk management and monitoring tools  our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of to no less frequently than quarterly 
this system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment ie  at the time of acquisition  although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business  the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors 
under this system  investments with a grade of involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis 
the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable  which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit 
investments graded involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition 
this portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable 
all investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of investments graded indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition  including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non compliance with debt covenants  however  payments are generally not more than days past due 
an investment grade of indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition  and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance 
for debt investments with an investment grade of  most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent 
for investments graded  it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit

realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to the unrealized gains or losses previously recognized  and include investments charged off during the period  net of recoveries 
unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations 
in order to validate market quotations  we look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value  including the source and nature of the quotations 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available ie  substantially all of our investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors  based on  among other things  the input of our investment adviser  audit committee and independent third party valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing month period  and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
the valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter  and a minimum of of our portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an independent valuation firm each quarter 
in addition  our independent accountants review our valuation process as part of their overall integrated audit 
as part of the valuation process  we may take into account the following types of factors  if relevant  in determining the fair value of our investments the enterprise value of a portfolio company an estimate of the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities  changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation 
because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors as described herein 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period 
additionally  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize 
further  such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities 
if we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale  we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned 
see risk factors risks relating to our investments declines in market prices and liquidity in the corporate debt markets can result in significant net unrealized depreciation of our portfolio  which in turn would reduce our net asset value 
our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with our portfolio management team 
preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed with our investment adviser s management and investment professionals  and then valuation recommendations are presented to our board of directors 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews these valuations  as well as the input of third parties  including independent third party valuation firms  with respect to the valuations of a minimum of of our portfolio at fair value 
our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on  among other things  the input of our investment adviser  audit committee and where applicable  independent third party valuation firms

as a result  the initial amortized cost basis and fair value for the acquired investments were the same at april  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  
off balance sheet arrangements the company has various commitments to fund investments in its portfolio  as described below 
as of december  and  the company had the following commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans  including commitments the funding of which is at or substantially at the company s discretion as of december  in millions total revolving and delayed draw commitments less funded commitments total unfunded commitments less commitments substantially at discretion of the company less unavailable commitments due to borrowing base or other covenant restrictions total net adjusted unfunded revolving and delayed draw commitments included within the total revolving and delayed draw commitments as of december  are commitments to issue up to million in standby letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies 
under these arrangements  if the standby letters of credit were to be issued  the company would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations 
as of december   the company had million in standby letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies  of which no amounts were recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company 
of these letters of credit million expire in and million expire in as of december  and  the company was party to subscription agreements to fund equity investments in private equity investment partnerships as of december  in millions total private equity commitments less funded private equity commitments total unfunded private equity commitments less private equity commitments substantially at discretion of the company total net adjusted unfunded private equity commitments in the ordinary course of business  allied capital had issued guarantees on behalf of certain portfolio companies 
under these arrangements  payments would be required to be made to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment 
as part of the allied acquisition  the company assumed such outstanding guarantees or similar obligations 
as a result  as of december  and  the company had outstanding guarantees or similar obligations totaling million 
further in the ordinary course of business  we may sell certain of our investments to third party purchasers 
in particular  since the allied acquisition we have sold and currently continue to seek opportunities to sell certain of allied capital s equity investments larger than those we have historically made and controlled portfolio company equity investments 
in connection with these sales as well as certain other sales we have  and may continue to do so in the future  agreed to indemnify such purchasers for future liabilities arising from the investments and the related sale transaction 
such indemnification provisions may give rise to future liabilities 
as of december   one of the company s portfolio companies  ciena capital llc ciena  had one non recourse securitization small business administration sba loan warehouse facility  which has reached its maturity date but remains outstanding 
ciena is working with the providers of the sba loan warehouse facility with regard to the repayment of that facility 
allied capital had previously issued a performance guaranty which ares capital succeeded to as a result of the allied acquisition whereby ares capital must indemnify the warehouse providers for any damages  losses  liabilities and related costs and expenses that they may incur as a result of ciena s failure to perform any of its obligations as loan originator  loan seller or loan servicer under the warehouse facility 
as of december   there are no known issues or claims with respect to this performance guaranty 
recent developments in january  ares capital and ares capital cp amended the revolving funding facility to  among other things  i extend the reinvestment period by one year to january   ii extend the maturity date by one year to january   and iii replace the pricing grid with an applicable spread over libor of and an applicable spread over base rate of 
in january  we established  through our wholly owned subsidiary acjb llc  the smbc funding facility by entering into a loan and servicing agreement the smbc loan and servicing agreement with acjb llc  as the borrower  smbc  as the administrative agent  collateral agent  and lender  pursuant to which smbc has agreed to extend credit to acjb llc in an aggregate principal amount up to million at any one time outstanding 
in connection with the smbc funding facility  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with acjb llc  pursuant to which we may sell acjb llc certain first lien loans we have originated or acquired  or will originate or acquire the smbc loans from time to time 
the smbc funding facility is a revolving funding facility with a reinvestment period ending january  and a final maturity date of january  the reinvestment period and final maturity are both subject to two one year extensions by mutual agreement 
subject to certain exceptions  the interest rate charged on the smbc funding facility is based on libor plus with no floor or a base rate which is the greater of a prime rate and the federal funds rate plus plus with no floor 
the smbc loan and servicing agreement includes usual and customary events of default for revolving funding facilities of this nature  including allowing smbc  upon a default  to accelerate and foreclose on the smbc loans and to pursue the rights under the smbc loans directly with the obligors thereof 
in january  we completed a public add on equity offering the january offering pursuant to which we sold million shares of common stock at a net price of per share 
total proceeds from the january offering  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us  were approximately million 
in february  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes mature on february  and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after february  at a par redemption price of per security plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the principal amount of the notes will be payable at maturity 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year payable quarterly commencing on may  total proceeds from the issuance of the notes  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs  were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds of the january offering and the issuance of the notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and the revolving funding facility 
from january  through february   we had made new investment commitments of million  of which million were funded 
of these new commitments  were in first lien senior secured debt and were investments in subordinated certificates of the sslp which were applied to co investments with ge in senior secured loans 
of the million of new investment commitments  all were floating rate 
the weighted average yield of debt and income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 
we may seek to syndicate a portion of these new investment commitments to third parties  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
from january  through february   we exited million of investment commitments 
of these investment commitments  were in first lien senior secured debt and were in equity and other securities 
of the million of exited investment commitments  were floating rate investments and were non interest bearing 
the weighted average yield of debt and income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 
on the million of investment commitments exited from january  through february   we recognized total net realized losses of approximately million 
included within the million of investment commitments exited from january  through february  were million of investment commitments acquired as part of the allied acquisition 
we recognized no realized gains or losses on the investments exited that were acquired as part of the allied acquisition 
in addition  as of february   we had an investment backlog and pipeline of approximately million and million  respectively 
the consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon  among other things  one or more of the following satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company  our acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation 
in addition  we may syndicate a portion of these investments to third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will make any of these investments or that we will syndicate any portion of these investments

interest and dividend income recognition interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 
discounts from and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums  if any 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full 
accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and  in management s judgment  are likely to remain current 
the company may make exceptions to this if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection 
dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected 
dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies 
payment in kind interest the company has loans in its portfolio that contain pik provisions 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain the company s status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends even though the company has not yet collected the cash 
capital structuring service fees and other income the company s investment adviser seeks to provide assistance to our portfolio companies in connection with the company s investments and in return the company may receive fees for capital structuring services 
these fees are generally only available to the company as a result of the company s underlying investments  are normally paid at the closing of the investments  are generally non recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned upon closing of the investment 
the services that the company s investment adviser provides vary by investment  but generally include reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from multiple equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  and providing general financial advice  which concludes upon closing of the investment 
any services of the above nature subsequent to the closing would generally generate a separate fee payable to the company 
in certain instances where the company is invited to participate as a co lender in a transaction and does not provide significant services in connection with the investment  a portion of loan fees paid to the company in such situations will be deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
the company s investment adviser may also take a seat on the board of directors of a portfolio company  or observe the meetings of the board of directors without taking a formal seat 
other income includes fees for asset management  management and consulting services  loan guarantees  commitments  amendments and other services rendered by the company to portfolio companies 
such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered 
foreign currency translation the company s books and records are maintained in us dollars 
any foreign currency amounts are translated into us dollars on the following basis fair value of investment securities  other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the period 
purchases and sales of investment securities  income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions  income or expenses 
results of operations based on changes in foreign exchange rates are separately disclosed in the statement of operations 
foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in us companies and us government securities 
these risks include  but are not limited to  currency fluctuation and revaluations and future adverse political  social and economic developments  which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable us companies or us government securities 
accounting for derivative instruments the company does not utilize hedge accounting and marks its derivatives to market through unrealized gains losses in the accompanying statement of operations 
equity offering expenses the company s offering costs  excluding underwriters fees  are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when received 
debt issuance costs debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt instrument using the straight line method  which closely approximates the effective yield method 
us federal income taxes the company has elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics 
to qualify as a ric  the company must  among other things  timely distribute to its stockholders at least of its investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  for each year 
the company  among other things  has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders  which will generally relieve the company from us federal income taxes 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such income into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
to the extent that the company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions  the company accrues excise tax  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned 
certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
dividends to common stockholders dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex dividend date 
the amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by our board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management 
net realized capital gains  if any  are generally distributed at least annually  although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions we declare in cash on behalf of our stockholders  unless a stockholder elects to receive cash 
as a result  if our board of directors authorizes  and we declare  a cash dividend  then our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  rather than receiving the cash dividend 
while we generally use newly issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan especially if our shares are trading at a premium to net asset value  we may purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the dividend reinvestment plan 
in particular  if our shares are trading at a significant enough discount to net asset value and we are otherwise permitted under applicable law to purchase such shares  we intend to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of actual and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income or loss and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include the valuation of investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates 
because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings  our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
see risk factors we are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates 
as of december   approximately of the investments at fair value in our portfolio were at fixed rates  approximately were at variable rates  were non interest earning and were on non accrual status 
additionally  for the investments at variable rates  of the investments contain interest rate floors representing of total investments at fair value 
the revolving credit facility  the revolving funding facility  the smbc funding facility and the debt securitization all bear interest at variable rates with no interest rate floors  while the notes  notes  notes and convertible notes bear interest at fixed rates 
we regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk 
we assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities 
based on that review  we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates 
while hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively hedge our interest rate risk
