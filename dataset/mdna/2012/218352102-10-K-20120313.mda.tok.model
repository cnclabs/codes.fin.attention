item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations results of operations 
manufacturing korlym as a drug discovery  development and commercialization company  we intend to continue to utilize our financial resources to commercialize korlym and advance other product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing our own manufacturing facilities 
we intend to continue to rely on experienced contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates 
we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with one contract manufacturer  produits chimiques auxiliaires et de synthese sa pcas  to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient api for korlym 
the fda approved our commercial use of material produced by pcas as part of our nda submission for korlym 
the agreement with pcas  which was executed in november  is for an initial period of five years with an automatic extension for one additional year 
we intend to pursue discussions to continue the relationship thereafter 
after nda approval  the agreement calls for us to purchase from pcas of our requirements for six months immediately following approval and of our requirements thereafter until the expiration of the agreement 
if pcas is unable to manufacture the product for a consecutive six month period  we have the right to terminate the agreement  without penalty 
we have also entered into an agreement with another contract manufacturer  pharmaform  llc pharmaform  for the production of korlym tablets 
prior to the approval of our nda  our need for korlym tablets was limited to the amounts required to support our clinical trials and the registration and validation batches needed to support our nda filing for korlym 
the agreement with pharmaform was executed in december and was due to expire upon the completion of the development program for korlym 
there are no minimum purchase amounts under this agreement 
we are currently in negotiations with pharmaform for a new agreement for the production of commercial quantities of korlym tablets 
competition for korlym korlym will compete with established treatments  including surgery  radiation  and approved medicines prescribed off label  and  potentially  compounds under development for cushing s syndrome 
we may experience competition from novartis  which has received a recommendation for approval in the eu to market its somatostatin analogue  pasireotide  for the treatment of patients with cushing s disease a subset of the patients with cushing s syndrome who have failed or are not candidates for surgery 
in the united states  novartis completed its phase trial of pasireotide in cushing s disease and submitted an nda to the fda in june  which it withdrew in october due to an issue related to chemistry  manufacturing and controls 
novartis has stated that it plans to resubmit the nda following discussions with the fda 
we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma has received an orphan drug designation in the united states and europe for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome and has begun a clinical trial in europe and the united states 
if this product is approved for commercialization in the united states or the eu  
table of contents our potential future revenue could be reduced 
we are also aware that exelgyn laboratories  which operates as a subsidiary of medi challenge pty ltd  received orphan drug designation for endogenous cushing s syndrome in europe  but they have stated that they have not yet conducted any clinical trials 
many colleges  universities and public and private research organizations are also active in the human health care field 
while these entities focus on education  they may develop or acquire proprietary technology that we may require for the development of our product candidates 
we may attempt to obtain licenses to this proprietary technology 
our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to develop proprietary products  attract and retain scientific personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our product candidates  obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our future products either alone or through outside parties 
intellectual property patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
it is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions  and to rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
under an agreement with stanford university  we have licensed exclusive rights to the following issued us patents and any corresponding foreign patents us patent number subject matter expiration date  use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of psychotic major depression october   use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of cocaine induced psychosis october   use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of early dementia february  the corresponding foreign patents expire in we are required to make milestone payments and pay royalties to stanford university on sales of products commercialized under any of the above patents 
we are currently in compliance with our obligations under the agreement 
if stanford university were to terminate any of our exclusive licenses due to breach of the license on our part  we would not be able to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis or early dementia 
we also own issued us patents for the use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment  for the treatment of weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication  for the prevention and treatment of stress disorders  for increasing the therapeutic response to ect  for the treatment of delirium  for the treatment of catatonia  for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and for inhibiting cognitive deterioration in adults with down s syndrome 
the expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from to in addition  we have seven us method of use applications covering certain gr ii antagonists  including the treatment of patients suffering from mental disorders by optimizing mifepristone levels in plasma serum  neurological damage in premature infants  muscular dystrophy  
table of contents migraine headaches  psychosis associated with interferon alpha therapy  depression in patients taking interleukin il  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als 
the approximate expiration dates of the patents that could issue from these applications and their foreign counterparts range from to we have composition of matter claims on three patent families of novel selective gr ii antagonists 
applications for all of the three families have been allowed in both the united states and europe 
the expiration dates of these us and european patents range from to a fourth composition of matter patent application is pending 
we have also filed  where we deemed appropriate  foreign patent applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth sought in these applications  or that competitors will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued 
although three of our patents have claims directed to the composition of compounds  we do not have a patent with claims directed to the composition of mifepristone 
our rights under our issued patents related to mifepristone cover only the use of that compound in the treatment of specific diseases 
the composition of matter patent covering mifepristone has expired 
the only previously fda approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy 
the fda has imposed significant restrictions on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy 
to protect our market for korlym we plan to rely on the exclusive marketing rights conferred as a benefit of orphan drug designation in the united states and eu  the restrictions imposed by the fda on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy  the different patient populations  administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat cushing s syndrome and our method of use patents described above 
the patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical industry are highly uncertain  involve complex legal and factual questions and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation 
our product candidates may give rise to claims that we infringe on the products or proprietary rights of others 
if it is determined that our drug candidates infringe on others patent rights  we may be required to obtain licenses to those rights 
if we fail to obtain licenses when necessary  we may experience delays in commercializing our product candidates while attempting to design around other patents  or determine that we are unable to commercialize our product candidates at all 
if we do become involved in intellectual property litigation  we are likely to incur considerable costs in defending or prosecuting the litigation 
we believe that we do not currently infringe any third party s patents or other proprietary rights  and we are not obligated to pay royalties to any third party other than stanford university 
in november  mclean hospital had alleged that it also had rights to the technology that led to the patent for the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
mclean hospital was a prior employer of one of our founders  dr 
alan schatzberg  and it alleged that the invention of the technology underlying this patent was conceived by dr 
schatzberg and or dr 
anthony rothschild while the two were employed by mclean hospital 
we contended that the invention was actually conceived by dr 
schatzberg and dr 
joseph belanoff while they were employed by stanford university and that the patent was appropriately assigned by them to stanford university 
in october  we announced a resolution of this issue in which we retained our exclusive rights under the patent and which required us to make no additional payments under the 
table of contents license  regardless of the resolution of the impending inventorship dispute 
in january  the inventorship issue was resolved in favor of stanford university 
as discussed earlier under competition  in akzo nobel filed an observation to the grant of our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression 
in february  the epo allowed our patent application 
we are not aware of any other disputes related to patent issues 
license agreement under our exclusive license agreement with stanford university to patents covering the use of mifepristone to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for the treatment of early dementia  we are required to pay stanford  annually as a nonrefundable royalty payment 
this payment is creditable against future royalties 
we are also obligated to pay stanford a  milestone upon the filing of the nda for mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression and a further  milestone payment upon fda approval of mifepristone for that indication 
the milestone payments are also creditable against future royalties 
this license agreement expires upon expiration of the related patents or upon notification by us to stanford 
see intellectual property 
government regulation prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation  including regulations that govern the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  and promotion of the products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization 
the process required by the fda before a new drug may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing  submission of an ind  which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic s intended use  and  in the case of a new drug  approval by the fda of an nda 
the process of complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations in order to obtain the necessary approvals and subsequently complying with federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense 
preclinical studies are generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product 
drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the fda as a part of an ind  which must be approved before beginning clinical trials in humans 
typically  human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
phase clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile  maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of the product candidate in human volunteers 
phase clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
phase large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the drug and to provide enough data to demonstrate with substantial evidence the efficacy and safety of the product  as required by the fda 
the fda and the institutional review boards closely monitor the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the united states and may reevaluate  alter  suspend or terminate the testing at any time for various reasons  including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the fda may also require that additional studies be conducted  such as studies demonstrating that the drug being tested does not cause cancer 
after phase trials are completed  drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies  clinical trials  formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the fda in the form of an nda for approval to 
table of contents commence commercial sales 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept an nda for filing 
if the fda accepts an nda for filing  it may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not meet regulatory approval criteria 
fda approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if the fda approves an nda  the subject drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the united states 
once approved  the fda may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre and post market regulatory standards is not maintained 
the drug developer must submit periodic reports to the fda 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removal 
product approvals may be withdrawn if problems with safety or efficacy occur after the product reaches the marketplace 
in addition  the fda may require post marketing studies  referred to as phase studies  to monitor the effect of approved products  and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post market studies 
facilities used to manufacture drugs are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other authorities where applicable  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices regulations cgmp 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
with respect to post market product advertising and promotion  the fda imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals  which include  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from fda standards  a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre cleared by the fda  and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions 
in addition to studies requested by the fda after approval  a drug developer may conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the approved compound for treatment of new indications 
the purpose of these trials and studies and related publications is to broaden the application and use of the drug and its acceptance in the medical community 
data supporting the use of a drug for these new indications must be submitted to the fda in a new or supplemental nda that must be approved by the fda before the drug can be marketed for the new indications 
orphan drug designation 
we have received orphan drug designation for korlym for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome in both the united states and the eu 
in the united states  orphan drug designation provides special status to a product to treat a rare disease or condition providing that the product meets certain criteria 
orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the orphan drug act  including seven years of exclusive marketing rights for the specific drug for the orphan indication 
a marketing application for a prescription drug product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition 
benefits of orphan drug designation in the eu are similar to those in the us  but include ten years of marketing exclusivity in all member states  free scientific advice during drug development  access to a centralized review process and a reduction or complete waiver of fees levied by the european medicines agency 
approvals outside the united states 
other than applying for and receiving orphan drug designation for korlym for cushing s syndrome in the eu  we have not started the regulatory approval process in any jurisdiction other than the united states and we are unable to estimate when  if ever  we will commence the regulatory approval process in any foreign jurisdiction 
we or our partners will have to complete an approval 
table of contents process similar to the us approval process in foreign target markets for our product candidates before we can commercialize our product candidates in those countries 
the approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and can involve additional testing 
foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
regulatory approval of pricing is required in most countries other than the united states 
the prices approved may be too low to generate an acceptable return to us 
fast track designation 
the fda sometimes grants fast track status under the food and drug administration modernization act of the fast track mechanism was created to facilitate the development and approval of new drugs intended for the treatment of life threatening conditions for which there are no effective treatments and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition 
the fast track process includes scheduling of meetings to seek fda input into development plans  the option of submitting an nda serially in sections rather than submitting all components simultaneously  the option to request evaluation of studies using surrogate endpoints  and the potential for a priority review 
we have been granted fast track status for mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
however  the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda at any time 
the fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that mifepristone will receive regulatory approval 
priority review 
the fda has indicated to us that it will grant us a priority review of our nda of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression if no other medications have been approved for this indication at the time of our submission 
employees we are managed by a core group of experienced pharmaceutical executives with a track record of bringing new drugs to market 
to facilitate advancement of development programs  we also enlist the expertise of associates and advisors with extensive pharmaceutical development experience 
as of december   we had full time employees  five part time employees and long term contract staff 
four of our employees have mds we consider our employee relations to be good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves significant risks 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this form k  including our financial statements and related notes  before you decide to invest in our common stock 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe might materially affect us  however  they may not be the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligations to update any risk factors 
risks related to the commercialization of korlym and development of mifepristone and our other proprietary gr ii antagonists we depend heavily on the success of korlym 
if we are unable to commercialize korlym  or experience significant delays in doing so  we may not generate revenues and our stock price will likely decline 
we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate meaningful revenues and achieve profitability will be solely dependent on the successful commercialization of korlym 
many factors could harm our efforts to commercialize korlym  including an inability to generate meaningful revenue due to low product usage  inadequate reimbursement or other factors  an inability to manufacture korlym or the active ingredient in korlym in commercial quantities and at an acceptable cost  political concerns relating to other uses of mifepristone  or ru  that could limit the market acceptance of korlym  insufficient funding  negative  inconclusive or otherwise unfavorable results from any post approval studies we conduct  previously unknown  serious side effects that may be identified  rapid technological change making korlym obsolete  and competition from companies with greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours 
physicians may accept korlym slowly or may never accept it  which would adversely affect our financial results 
many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of korlym 
even though the fda has approved korlym  physicians may not adopt it as a treatment for their eligible patients 
physicians will prescribe korlym only if they determine  based on experience  clinical data  side effect profiles and other factors  that it is preferable to other products or treatments currently in use  even if those products are not approved for cushing s syndrome 
because cushing s syndrome is rare  most physicians are inexperienced in the care of patients with the illness and it may be difficult to persuade them to prescribe a new treatment  such as korlym  even with clinical trial results that suggest that it may be a compelling alternative treatment for them to consider 
acceptance of korlym among influential practitioners may be essential for market acceptance of korlym 
other factors that may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of korlym include the effectiveness of korlym  including any side effects  as compared to alternative treatment methods  
table of contents the rate of adoption of korlym by physicians and by target patient populations  the cost effectiveness of korlym and the availability of third party insurance coverage and reimbursement  in particular from government payors such as medicare and medicaid  for patients using korlym  the product labeling required by the fda for korlym  the extent and success of our efforts to manufacture  commercialize  market  distribute and sell korlym  the timing of market entry of korlym relative to competitive products  and negative publicity concerning korlym  ru  mifeprex or mifepristone 
the failure of korlym to achieve market acceptance would prevent us from generating meaningful revenue 
if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate coverage and reimbursement for korlym from third party payors  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
there is significant uncertainty related to the availability of third party insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medications 
the commercial success of our medications in both domestic and international markets depends on whether third party coverage and reimbursement is available for them 
government payors  including medicare and medicaid  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medicines  and  as a result  they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our medications 
our near term dependence on the commercial success of korlym makes us particularly susceptible to any such cost containment or reduction efforts 
accordingly  even though korlym has been approved for commercial sale  unless government and other third party payors provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement  physicians may not prescribe it and patients may not purchase it 
in addition  meaningful delays in insurance coverage for individual patients may increase our costs and reduce our revenues 
further  we may need to obtain approvals from hospital formularies before korlym can be reimbursed for in patient treatment 
if we fail to obtain such approvals  this will reduce the level of revenues that we are able to attain 
in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls 
also  the trends toward managed health care in the united states and recent laws and legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for our future products or the exclusion of such products from reimbursement programs 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  collectively referred to as the ppaca  was passed 
the ppaca includes  among other things  the following measures annual  non deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports certain prescription drugs and biologics  increases in medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program for both branded and generic drugs  a new patient centered outcomes research institute to oversee  identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical research  new requirements for manufacturers to discount drug prices to eligible patients by percent at the pharmacy level and for mail order services in order for their outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d  
table of contents an increase in the number of entities eligible for discounts under the public health service pharmaceutical pricing program  and establishment of a licensure framework for follow on biologic products 
the ppaca provisions on comparative clinical effectiveness research extend the initiatives of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  also known as the stimulus package  which included billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments 
this stimulus funding was designated for  among other things  conducting  supporting or synthesizing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits  clinical outcomes  effectiveness and appropriateness of products 
the ppaca also appropriates additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research 
although congress has indicated that this funding is intended to improve the quality of health care  it remains unclear how the research will impact current medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third party payor policies 
since its passage  a number of state governors have strenuously opposed certain of the ppaca s provisions  and initiated lawsuits challenging its constitutionality 
these challenges are pending final adjudication in several jurisdictions  including the united states supreme court 
congress has also proposed a number of legislative initiatives  including possible repeal of the ppaca 
at this time  it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the ppaca  whether to certain provisions or its entirety 
in addition  other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the ppaca was enacted 
most recently  on august   the budget control act of among other things  created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress 
the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least trillion for the years through  triggering the legislation s automatic reduction to several government programs 
this includes aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to per fiscal year  starting in the ppaca and regulations and policies implementing this legislation  as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future  may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products 
the orphan drug designation for korlym may not provide protection from competition and other benefits as anticipated 
in july  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for korlym for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery 
drugs that receive orphan drug designation obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication from the date of drug approval  as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs  marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the fda in the drug development process 
in october  the european commission granted to us orphan designation for korlym for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome hypercortisolism in the eu 
benefits of orphan drug designation in the eu are similar to those in the us  but include ten years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication in all member states  free scientific advice during drug development  access to a centralized review process and a reduction or complete waiver of fees levied by the european medicines agency 
although we have received orphan drug designation in both the united states and the eu  we cannot be assured that we will recognize the potential benefits of these designations 
even after an orphan drug is approved for its orphan indication  the fda can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is safer  more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care 
in addition  the fda may  during the seven year orphan drug exclusivity period  approve the same drug for a different indication 

table of contents we are also aware that laboratoire hra pharma has received an orphan drug designation in the united states and europe for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome and has begun a phase clinical trial in europe and the united states for this indication 
we are also aware that exelgyn laboratories  which operates as a subsidiary of medi challenge pty ltd  received orphan drug designation for cushing s syndrome in europe  but they have stated that they have not yet conducted any clinical trials 
if another drug with mifepristone as its active ingredient is approved in the eu for cushing s syndrome before korlym  we will not garner the ten years of marketing exclusivity from the date of drug approval in the eu and other benefits that we anticipate 
any delay in our commercialization of korlym may have a negative impact on the revenue that we might be able to realize from the exclusivity provided during the applicable periods 
we may face competition from other companies that attempt to develop mifepristone or other compounds for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  which could limit our future revenues from the commercialization of korlym and which could have a negative impact on future revenues from the commercialization of korlym for any indication 
we may experience competition from novartis  which has received a recommendation for approval in the eu to market its somatostatin analogue  pasireotide  for the treatment of patients with cushing s disease a subset of the patients with cushing s syndrome who have failed or are not candidates for surgery 
in the united states  novartis completed its phase trial of pasireotide in cushing s disease and submitted an nda to the fda in june it withdrew this nda in october due to an unspecified issue related to its chemistry  manufacturing and controls  but has stated that it plans to resubmit its nda 
as discussed above in the risk related to orphan drug designation  we are also aware that laboratoire hra pharma has begun a phase ii clinical trial in europe and the united states evaluating the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome 
if another product for treatment of cushing s syndrome or cushing s disease is approved for commercialization  our potential future revenue could be reduced 
we will need to develop medical education  sales and marketing capabilities to successfully commercialize korlym and our other proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
a limited number of our employees have experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products 
to achieve commercial success for any approved product  we must either develop a sales and marketing force or enter into arrangements with others to market and sell our current and future products 
we are seeking to hire experienced medical science liaisons and other personnel to commercialize korlym in the united states 
however  our medical education  sales and marketing efforts may not be successful or cost effective 
if our efforts to develop a commercial organization are not successful  cost effective and timely  we may not achieve profitability 
we will need to increase the size of our organization  and we may experience difficulties in managing growth 
as we expand our research and development efforts and develop a sales and marketing organization  we expect to experience growth  which may strain our operations  product development and other managerial and operating resources 
future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management  including the need to identify  recruit  maintain and integrate additional employees 
to date  we have relied on a 
table of contents small management team  including a number of part time contributors 
our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
to that end  we must be able to integrate additional management  clinical development  administrative and sales and marketing personnel  expand the size and composition of our management team  develop our administrative  accounting and management information systems and controls  hire and train additional qualified personnel  manage our clinical trials effectively  and manage our research and development efforts effectively 
we may not be able to accomplish these tasks  and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our business 
public perception of the active ingredient in korlym  mifepristone or ru  may limit our ability to market and sell korlym 
the active ingredient in korlym  mifepristone ru  is used to terminate pregnancy 
as a result  mifepristone has been and continues to be the subject of considerable ethical and political debate in the united states and elsewhere 
public perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to engage alternative manufacturers and may limit the commercial acceptance of korlym by patients and physicians 
even though we have taken measures to minimize the likelihood of the prescribing of korlym to a pregnant woman  physicians may choose not to prescribe korlym to a woman simply to avoid any risk of unintentionally terminating a pregnancy 
we have taken measures to control the distribution of korlym to reduce the potential for diversion and this controlled distribution may negatively impact sales of korlym 
we have no manufacturing capabilities and we currently depend on third parties to manufacture the active ingredient and the tablets for korlym  both of which are single source suppliers 
if these suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing korlym and we are unable to contract quickly with alternative sources  our business will be harmed 
we currently have no experience in  and we do not own facilities for  nor do we plan to develop facilities for  manufacturing any products 
we have an agreement with one approved manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api in korlym 
this agreement is due to expire in november and we have initiated discussions about extension of the agreement 
we have a memorandum of understanding with a second api manufacturer 
however  there are no activities currently being conducted at this site to develop or qualify the manufacturing processes or facilities and we did not request approval of material produced by this second manufacturer when we submitted our nda for korlym 
we have an agreement with the tablet manufacturer that we included in our nda submission 
this tablet manufacturer is a single source supplier to us 
although we have negotiated a contract with a potential back up tablet manufacturer  we have no assurance that we will be able to qualify this vendor as an alternate supplier 
if our single source supplier were to cease manufacturing tablets for us  fail to manufacture tablets on a timely basis  or fail to maintain manufacturing capabilities that meet fda standards  we might be required to qualify an alternate supplier and we would likely experience a lengthy delay in our manufacturing processes 
we cannot assure you that our single source supplier will be able or willing to meet our future demands 
our current arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by such manufacturers 
if we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient or korlym tablets from our contract 
table of contents manufacturers  we may not be able to manufacture our required quantities or identify alternate manufacturers of mifepristone or korlym tablets in a timely manner or on reasonable terms  if at all 
if our third party manufacturers of korlym fail to comply with fda regulations or otherwise fail to meet our requirements  our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed 
we depend on third party manufacturers to supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient in korlym and to manufacture korlym tablets 
these suppliers and manufacturers must comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations and guidelines 
our suppliers and manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages of qualified personnel 
their failure to follow cgmp or other regulatory requirements and to document their compliance with cgmp may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study or the termination or hold on a clinical study  or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for korlym 
if we  or our third party suppliers and manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations  sanctions could be imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could harm our business 
if the operations of any current or future supplier or manufacturer were to become unavailable for any reason  commercialization of korlym could be delayed and future revenue from product sales could be reduced 
if we or others identify previously unknown  serious side effects of mifepristone  we may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials  change the labeling of korlym or withdraw it from the market  any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues 
if we or others identify previously unknown  serious side effects of mifepristone regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals  we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials  make changes in labeling  implement changes to or obtain re approvals of our manufacturing facilities  we may experience a significant drop in the sales of korlym  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and we may become the target of lawsuits  including class action lawsuits 
any of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing korlym 
we may have substantial exposure to product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance to cover those claims 
we may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our products has resulted in adverse effects or that our product candidates are not effective  whether by participants in our clinical trials for korlym or other product candidates  or by patients using korlym 
a product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about korlym or any of our product candidates safety or efficacy and could limit our ability to sell a product by preventing or interfering with product commercialization 
in some cases  less common adverse effects of a pharmaceutical product are not known until long after the fda approves the product for marketing 
the active ingredient in korlym is used to terminate pregnancy 
therefore  clinicians using the medicine in our clinical trials and physicians prescribing the medicine to women with childbearing potential must take necessary and strict precautions to insure that the medicine is not administered to pregnant women 
the failure to observe these precautions could result in significant product claims 

table of contents we have only limited product liability insurance coverage  with limits that we believe to be customary for a company beginning to commercialize its first pharmaceutical product 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of korlym or any of our product candidates 
defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management s attention from conducting our business 
if a third party successfully sues us for any injury caused by our product candidates  our liability could exceed our total assets 
if we are unable to maintain regulatory approval of korlym  we will be unable to generate revenue and our business will be harmed 
the research  testing  manufacturing  selling and marketing of products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries  in which regulations differ from country to country 
failure to comply with the fda and other applicable foreign and us regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions 
these include warning letters  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production  and refusal to approve pending ndas  or supplements to approved ndas 
as is customary  the fda s approval of korlym was subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed and requirements for post marketing follow up studies and information reporting 
the fda s approval of korlym requires that we conduct a study of the interactions between korlym and ketoconazole  an anti fungal agent sometimes used to treat patients with cushing s syndrome 
it also requires us to conduct a drug utilization study to better characterize the reporting rates of adverse events associated with the long term use of korlym 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the medicine  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  may result in restrictions on the marketing of the medicine  and even result in withdrawal of korlym from the market 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for future product candidates  including mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  we will be limited in our ability to commercialize such product candidates and our business will be harmed 
obtaining regulatory approval of a new drug is an uncertain  lengthy and expensive process  and success is never guaranteed 
despite the time  resources and effort expended  failure can occur at any stage 
the fda has substantial discretion in the approval process for human medicines 
the fda can deny  delay or limit approval of a product candidate for many reasons including  but not limited to the fda may not find that the candidate is safe  the fda may not find data from the clinical or preclinical testing to be sufficient  or the fda may not approve our or our third party manufacturers processes or facilities 
future governmental action or changes in fda policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an nda in the united states 
in addition  because the only other currently fda approved use of mifepristone is the termination of pregnancy  we expect that the label for mifepristone for any indication  will include  as korlym s does  some limitations  including a so called black box warning that it should not be used by pregnant women or women seeking to become pregnant 
if we receive regulatory approval for our future product candidates  including mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression  we will be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review  such as continued safety reporting requirements  and we may also be subject to additional fda post marketing obligations 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and or may be subject to product recalls or seizures 

table of contents any regulatory approvals that we receive for our future product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing follow up studies 
in addition  if the fda approves any of our product candidates  the labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping for the medicine will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the medicine  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  may result in restrictions on the marketing of the medicine  and could include withdrawal of the medicine from the market 
if we market products in a manner that violates fda regulations or health care fraud and abuse laws  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
in the united states  we are subject to fda regulations governing the promotion of health care products 
although physicians are permitted  based on their medical judgment  to prescribe products for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda  manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off label uses 
in the united states  we will market korlym for treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of korlym for this indication 
although we believe our marketing materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute off label promotion of korlym  the fda may disagree 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials  training or other activities by our employees constitute off label promotion of korlym  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal or state enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
even if it is later determined that we are not in violation of these laws  we may be faced with negative publicity  incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters 
in addition  health care fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business 
the laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal health care programs anti kickback law  which prohibits  among other things  persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or paying remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for  or the purchase  order or recommendation of  any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs  federal false claims laws  which prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities  such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product  reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates  engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved  or off label uses  that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for non covered off label uses  and submitting inflated best price information to the medicaid rebate program 
the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  hipaa  which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters  
table of contents federal sunshine laws that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers  such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the ppaca on drug manufacturers regarding any transfer of value made or distributed to prescribers and other health care providers  and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws  such as anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor  including commercial insurers 
some states  such as california  massachusetts and vermont  mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 
moreover  recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws 
for example  the recently enacted ppaca  among other things  amends the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes  a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it 
in addition  the ppaca provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes 
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or the fda or any other governmental regulations that apply to us  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from governmental health care programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations  any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
if we decide  or if the fda or other regulatory agencies require us  to pursue additional clinical trials or other studies  there may be a delay in the development of our compounds  which may have a negative impact on our business 
we may decide  or the fda or other regulatory authorities may require us  to pursue additional clinical  preclinical or manufacturing studies for mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
additional trials or studies will require additional funding  the availability of which is not assured 
also  it is possible that additional trials or studies that we decide are necessary or desirable will delay or prevent the completion of the development of mifepristone for treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
many other factors could delay or result in termination of our clinical trials  including  but not limited to slow patient enrollment  availability of funding  negative or inconclusive results  patient noncompliance with the protocol  adverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials  negative or problematic fda inspections of our clinical operations or our manufacturing operations  and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of mifepristone 
even after we conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate for an optimal nda  we may not receive regulatory approval to market mifepristone for psychotic depression 

table of contents our clinical trials may not demonstrate that mifepristone is safe and effective for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
if our clinical program for mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for any other indications does not demonstrate safety and efficacy  our business will be harmed 
to gain regulatory approval from the fda to market mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  our on going phase clinical trial must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone for that indication 
clinical development is a long  expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays  and data obtained from clinical trials and supportive studies are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the ongoing phase clinical trial of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression may not demonstrate efficacy or safety results sufficient for approval  and we may need to conduct other studies in support of a potential nda in that indication 
our use of medavante to provide centralized psychiatric rating services in study  our ongoing clinical trial evaluating mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  may not result in any improvement in the accuracy and consistency of the psychiatric assessments and may continue to slow the pace of enrollment in study in connection with our ongoing phase trial evaluating mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  study  we engaged medavante to provide centralized psychiatric rating services 
medavante is providing centralized psychometric assessments via high resolution video conferencing 
the use of medavante s centralized rating services is intended to increase the accuracy and consistency of the psychiatric assessments 
medavante has provided similar centralized rating services to companies conducting clinical studies in various psychiatric disorders 
however  they have not previously provided centralized rating services to any study in patients with psychotic depression 
although we and medavante conducted a small pilot evaluation in patients with psychotic depression to assess patient receptivity  we cannot be certain that centralized rating will be successful with the patients enrolled in our study 
if patients are uncomfortable or unwilling to participate in the centralized rating process or if medavante is unable to provide services in a satisfactory manner over the course of the trial  we may not see any improvement in the accuracy or reliability of the psychiatric assessments 
such a result might diminish the likelihood of a successful trial or a definitive demonstration of the efficacy of mifepristone in treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
during screening for study  we have seen a higher than anticipated incidence of potential patients who do not meet appropriate criteria for entrance into the trial for diagnostic and other clinical reasons 
although we believe that this is the result of improved accuracy in the screening process resulting from the use of the medavante centralized rating services as an additional step in the selection of patients appropriate for inclusion in the study  medavante s diagnostic screening has resulted in slower patient enrollment but may not actually improve trial performance 
in addition  in mid  in order to lower expenses and to conserve financial resources  we scaled back our planned rate of spending on this trial and extended the timeline for its completion 
we are currently using a reduced total of eight clinical sites in order to conserve capital 
this strategy may result in increased total study costs over the longer term 
we depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis and  as a result  we may face costs and delays outside of our control 
we rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third parties to manage our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis 
however  we may not be able to control the timing of identification and selection of appropriate sites for our planned trials and the amount and timing of resources that the clinical sites that conduct the clinical testing may devote to our clinical trials 
if our clinical investigators and 
table of contents clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedules  we will be unable to complete our trials or to complete them as planned  which could delay or prevent us from completing the clinical development of mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression or other development programs 
we have an agreement with a clinical research organization cro that is conducting our ongoing phase trial evaluating mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression study to supervise and monitor clinical site performance and to perform investigator supervision  data collection and analysis for this trial 
we may not be able to maintain relationships with this or other cros or with the clinical investigators and the clinical sites through the completion of all trial activities without delays in anticipated timing of trial activities or excessive expenditures 
our agreements place substantial responsibilities on these parties  which could result in excessive expenditures for our clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected 
for example  if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with fda approved good clinical practices  we may be unable to use the data gathered at those sites 
if these cros  clinical investigators  clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for  or successfully commercialize  mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
the conduct of any future clinical trials will likely also be conducted through the use of cros and clinical research sites 
the conduct  timing and cost of these trials will be subject to the same kinds of risks as discussed above 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from commercializing korlym and our other product candidates abroad 
we may seek to commercialize our products and product candidates in international markets with the help of one or more partners or on our own 
outside the united states  we can commercialize a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and  in many cases  pricing approval  from the appropriate regulatory authorities  whose approval processes includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process  and  in some cases  additional risks 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
other than seeking and receiving orphan drug designation in the eu  we have not taken any actions to obtain foreign approvals 
we may not develop our product candidates in the clinic in order to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the fda 
we may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any foreign market 
the fast track designation for the development program of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process 
if a human medicine is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and the medicine demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition  the sponsor of an ind may apply for fda fast track designation for a particular indication 
marketing applications submitted by sponsors of product candidates in fast track development may qualify for expedited fda review under the policies and procedures offered by the fda  but the fast track designation does not assure any such qualification 
although we have obtained a fast track designation from the fda for mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  we may not experience a faster development process  review or approval compared to applications considered for approval under conventional fda procedures 
in addition  the fda may 
table of contents withdraw our fast track designation at any time 
if we lose our fast track designation  the approval process may be delayed 
in addition  our fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that mifepristone will receive regulatory approval for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we face competition from companies with substantial financial  technical and marketing resources  which could limit our future revenues from the commercialization of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for other indications 
if approved for commercial use as a treatment for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  mifepristone will compete with established treatments  including ect and combination medicinal therapy 
combination medicinal therapy consists of the use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines not currently approved for the treatment of psychotic depression 
the antipsychotics are prescribed by physicians for off label use to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression  which is the clinical target of mifepristone 
antipsychotics include abilify bristol myers squibb  clozaril novartis  geodon and navane pfizer  haldol ortho mcneil  mellaril mylan  risperdal janssen pharmaceuticals  seroquel astrazeneca  stelazine and thorazine glaxosmithkline and zyprexa eli lilly 
mifepristone may not compete effectively with these established treatments 
we are aware of one clinical trial conducted by organon  for a new chemical entity for the treatment of psychotic depression 
organon was the pharmaceutical division of akzo nobel  which was purchased by schering plough which was then subsequently acquired by merck co 
organon s new chemical entity is a gr ii antagonist  we believe that its commercial use would be covered by our patent 
as of the time of filing of this report  we are not aware of any other public disclosures by any company  regarding the development of new product candidates to treat psychotic depression 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies  as well as specialized pharmaceutical firms  universities and public and private research institutions 
moreover  we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made 
these competitors  either alone or with collaborative parties  may succeed with the development and commercialization of medicinal products that are superior to and more cost effective than mifepristone 
many of our competitors and related private and public research and academic institutions have greater experience  more financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing human medicines  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and commercializing products 
accordingly  mifepristone may not be an effective competitor against established treatments and our present or potential competitors may succeed in developing medicinal products that are superior to mifepristone or render mifepristone obsolete or non competitive 
if we are unable to establish mifepristone as a superior and cost effective treatment for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  or any future use  we may be unable to generate the revenues necessary to support our business 
our efforts to discover  develop and commercialize new product candidates beyond mifepristone are at a very early stage 
if we fail to identify and develop additional uses for gr ii antagonists  we may be unable to market additional products 
to develop additional potential sources of revenue  we believe that we must identify and develop additional product candidates 
we own or have exclusively licensed issued us patents covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat psychotic depression  mild cognitive impairment  weight gain due to treatment with antipsychotic medication  stress disorders  early dementia  delirium  gastroesophageal reflux disease  down s syndrome  catatonia and psychosis associated with cocaine addiction  and to increase the therapeutic response to electroconvulsive therapy ect 
in addition  we have seven us method of use patent applications covering gr ii antagonists for the treatment of a number of other metabolic and psychiatric disorders  three us 
table of contents composition of matter patents covering specific gr ii antagonists  and a fourth pending us composition of matter patent 
we have also filed patent applications in all of the major international markets 
we may not develop or continue to develop product candidates for any of the indications or compounds covered by our patents and patent applications 
typically  there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials  so our product development efforts may not lead to commercially viable products 
the use of gr ii antagonists may not be effective to treat these conditions or any other indications 
in addition  we could discover that the use of gr ii antagonists in these patient populations has unacceptable side effects or is otherwise not safe 
we may elect to enter into collaboration arrangements with respect to one or more of our product candidates 
if we do enter into such an arrangement  we would be dependent on a collaborative partner for the success of the product candidates developed under the arrangement 
any future collaborative partner may fail to successfully develop or commercialize a product candidate under a collaborative arrangement 
we only have significant clinical experience with mifepristone and we may determine that mifepristone is not desirable for uses other than for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery 
for example  we do not intend to develop mifepristone for mitigation of the weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa  risperdal or other atypical antipsychotics  even though we have reported positive results in the proof of concept studies described in part i  item  business overview mifepristone proof of concept studies for other metabolic disorders 
we are pursuing other gr ii antagonists for this use 
the compounds developed pursuant to our early clinical  preclinical and discovery research programs  including cort  may fail to become viable product candidates in spite of the resources we may dedicate to the program 
even if product candidates are identified  we may abandon further development efforts before we reach clinical trials or after expending significant expense and time conducting clinical trials due to financial constraints  concerns over the safety or efficacy of the product candidates  manufacturing difficulties or other reasons 
moreover  governmental authorities may enact new legislation or regulations that could limit or restrict our development efforts 
if we are unable to successfully discover and commercialize new uses for gr ii antagonists  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel  we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts 
we depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
we do not have agreements with any of our executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us or employment insurance covering any of our key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors 
the loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research  development and commercialization efforts without their expertise 
our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon retaining key research  technical  sales  marketing  managerial and financial personnel  and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified personnel in these areas 
we face intense competition for such personnel from numerous companies  as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations in the highly competitive northern california business area 
although we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to date  we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel in the future 
the inability to attract and retain these personnel could result in delays in the research  development and commercialization of our potential products 

table of contents rapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete 
pharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change and we expect that they will continue to do so 
our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies 
any products and processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any or all expenses incurred in connection with their development 
rapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete or uneconomical  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar events could cause damage to our own or our manufacturers facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or curtail operations 
because our executive offices are located in the san francisco bay area and some of our current manufacturers are located in earthquake prone areas  our business is vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters or other similarly disruptive events  including earthquake  fire  flood  power loss and communications failures 
in addition  political considerations relating to mifepristone may put us and our manufacturers at increased risk for terrorist attacks  protests or other disruptive events 
if any disaster or other similar event were to occur  we may not be able to operate our business and our manufacturers may not be able to produce our product candidates 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover  and our insurance policies may exclude coverage for  our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
risks related to our capital needs and financial results we will need additional capital in order to complete the development and commercialization of mifepristone and our other proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
additional capital may not be available to us at all or on favorable terms  which could adversely affect our business 
we may have to perform more clinical trials  in addition to our on going phase trial  prior to submitting an nda for mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
if so  we may need to raise additional funds to complete the development of mifepristone for that indication 
in addition  we may need to raise additional funds for the commercialization of korlym  should the medicine s commercialization require more funds than we currently plan  and to continue and expand the development of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists in various indications 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations through the end of however  our expectations are based on our ability to commercialize korlym successfully  as well as our currently planned clinical development and research programs for mifepristone and for certain of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists  which may change as a result of many factors  including the amount and timing of revenues from the commercialization of korlym  the pace at which physicians adopt korlym as a treatment  the willingness of insurance companies  the government and other third party payors to provide coverage for korlym at reasonable rates  changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies  the costs  timing of site selection and enrollment of our clinical trials  the results of our research efforts and clinical trials  the need to perform additional clinical trials and other supportive studies  the need to establish second sources for the manufacture of korlym api and tablets  
table of contents the timing of the submission of an nda to the fda  the acceptance of the filing and approval of an nda by the fda to market mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  the timing of commercialization of mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression 
developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  including announcements of claims of infringement  interference or litigation against us or our licensors  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in our growth rates  and changes in our research development plans for our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
even though we have raised funds a number of times in the past  market and economic conditions may make it difficult for us to raise any or sufficient additional capital 
the sales of common stock and warrants and the exercises of warrants have been dilutive to stockholders and any exercise of outstanding warrants and additional equity financing will cause further dilution to stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to korlym  our technologies or product candidates  which we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations 
we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for at least the next few years 
we are a development stage company with no current source of product revenue 
we have a limited history of operations and have focused primarily on clinical trials 
we are beginning to commercialize korlym and  if the outcome of our clinical trials supports it  we plan to seek fda regulatory clearance to market mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
historically  we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our equity securities 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we do not know when or if we will generate product revenue 
subject to our ability to raise additional funds  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with the clinical trials and other development activities for mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for other product candidates 
we expect to incur significant expenses related to commercializing korlym 
as a result  we expect that our losses will increase at least until korlym is commercially available to patients and generating material amounts of revenue 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether or when we will become profitable 
the committed equity financing facility ceff that we entered into with kingsbridge in march may not be available to us at certain times  may generate a lower level of funding than we anticipate  may require us to make additional blackout or other payments to kingsbridge  and will result in dilution to our stockholders 
kingsbridge will not be obligated to purchase shares under the ceff unless certain conditions are met  which include a minimum price for our common stock  currently set at per share  and the effectiveness and continued effectiveness of the required resale registration statements 
the actual amount of funds that can be raised under the ceff will be dependent on the number of shares actually sold under the agreement and the market value of our stock during the pricing periods of each sale 

table of contents in june  the sec declared effective our registration statement with the sec covering the resale of approximately million of the shares issuable under the ceff and the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
this registration statement covers approximately of the million shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff and all of the  shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
we intend to file an additional registration statement covering the resale of the remaining shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff days after kingsbridge and its affiliates have resold substantially all of the securities covered by this initial registration statement  therefore  the timing of the submission of this subsequent registration statement is uncertain 
this subsequent registration statement may be subject to review and comment by the staff of the sec  and will require the consent of our independent registered public accounting firm 
we cannot assure you that this registration statement will be declared effective or  if declared effective  that it will remain continuously effective thereafter 
in addition  kingsbridge is permitted to terminate the ceff if it determines that a material and adverse event has occurred affecting our business  operations  properties or financial condition and if such condition continues for a period of days from the date kingsbridge provides us notice of such material and adverse event 
if we are unable to access funds through the ceff  or if the ceff is terminated by kingsbridge  we may be unable to access alternative capital on favorable terms or at all 
we are entitled  in certain circumstances  to deliver a blackout notice to kingsbridge to suspend the use of the resale registration statement and prohibit kingsbridge from selling shares thereunder 
if we deliver a blackout notice in the trading days following the settlement of a draw down  or if the resale registration statement is not effective in circumstances not permitted by our agreement with kingsbridge  then we may be required to make a payment to kingsbridge or to issue kingsbridge additional shares in lieu of the payment 
if the trading price of our common stock declines during a suspension of the resale registration statement  the blackout or other payment could be significant 
any shares that we may issue to kingsbridge under the ceff will have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our current stockholders  and may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
for each draw down under the ceff  we will issue shares to kingsbridge at a discount of up to from the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the eight day trading period following the issuance of the draw down notice 
if we draw down amounts under the ceff when our share price is decreasing  we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was higher 
issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if our share price were stable or increasing and may further decrease our share price 
we may not be able to pursue all of our product research and development opportunities if we are unable to secure adequate funding for these programs 
the costs required to start or continue many of the programs that our intellectual property allow us to consider for further development are collectively greater than the funds currently available to us 
for example  we have successfully discovered three series of compounds that are selective gr ii antagonists but  unlike mifepristone  do not appear to block the progesterone receptor 
further development of these proprietary compounds or any further development stemming from our method of use patents may be delayed or cancelled if we determine that such development may jeopardize our ability to complete the commercialization of korlym or to complete the clinical development of mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression 
global economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
in the united states and globally  market and economic conditions have been volatile over the past few years  with significantly tighter credit conditions in the markets in which we conduct our operations 
the us and global economies have experienced a recession and face continued concerns about the systemic impact of adverse economic conditions  such as unstable global financial markets  adverse effects on the cost and availability of capital  high corporate  consumer and governmental debt levels and high unemployment 
concern 
table of contents about the stability of the markets generally  and the strength of counterparties specifically  has led and may again lead many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease  to provide credit to businesses 
renewed or increased turbulence in the global markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
in addition  our access to funds under our ceff or any credit facility into which we may enter depends on the ability of the counterparties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us 
we cannot assure you that long term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among  and potential failures of  third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on such counterparties 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow funds  access our ceff or raise equity or debt capital  we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity 
such alternatives may include  without limitation  curtailing clinical or drug development activity  or limiting our commercial efforts  product manufacturing or sales and marketing support  which would have an adverse affect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if we acquire other gr ii antagonists or other technologies or potential products  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire other gr ii antagonists  particularly gr ii antagonists that do not terminate pregnancy 
we may also be able to acquire other technologies or potential products that are complementary to our operating plan 
we currently have no commitments  agreements or plans for any acquisitions 
the process of acquiring rights to another gr ii antagonist or any other potential product or technology may result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
in addition  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquired potential product or technology 
future acquisitions could dilute our stockholders ownership interest in us and could cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization or other expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
risks relating to our intellectual property if korlym or future product candidates conflict with the patents of others or if we become involved in other intellectual property disputes  we may have to engage in costly litigation or obtain a license and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for the use of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and other potential uses of gr ii antagonists 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our intellectual property and erode our competitive advantage 
to date  we own nine issued us method of use patents and have exclusively licensed three issued us method of use patents 
we have seven us method of use patent applications pending for gr ii antagonists 
we own three composition of matter patents and have one composition of matter patent application pending 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering our product candidates as we deem appropriate 
we have also filed  where we deemed appropriate  foreign patent applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
we have exclusively licensed three issued us patents from stanford university for the use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of psychotic major depression  which is commonly referred to as psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis and early dementia  including early alzheimer s disease 
we bear the costs of protecting and defending the rights to these patents 
in order to maintain the exclusive license to these 
table of contents patents until their expiration  we are obligated to make milestone and royalty payments to stanford university 
we are currently in compliance with our obligations under this agreement 
if we become noncompliant  we may lose the right to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis and early dementia and our business would be materially harmed 
in addition  if stanford university were to terminate our mifepristone license due to breach of the license on our part  we would not be able to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis or early dementia 
our patent applications and patents licensed or issued to us may be challenged by third parties and our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
for example  in  akzo nobel  which was subsequently acquired by schering plough which was then subsequently acquired by merck co  filed an observation challenging the claims of our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression 
in this instance  the patent later issued and  in  we received notice that there will be no opposition proceedings in europe in regard to this patent 
our presently pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patent issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
for example  the arguments presented by akzo nobel could be raised in the united states either before the us patent and trademark office or in a court of law 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued to us  or which may be issued to us in the future  may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our competitors may produce competing products based on our technology  which would impair our ability to compete 
if a third party were successful in asserting an infringement claim against us  we could be forced to pay damages and prevented from developing  manufacturing or marketing our potential products 
we do not have liability insurance for patent infringements 
a third party could require us to obtain a license to continue to use their intellectual property  and we may not be able to do so on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
we believe that significant litigation will continue in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our resources 
regardless of the merit of any particular claim  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  is expensive and diverts management s attention from other business 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our ability to compete in the market could be diminished 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information 
nevertheless  these measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if they do not adequately protect our rights  third parties could use our proprietary information  which could diminish our ability to compete in the market 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our product candidates may breach their agreements with us regarding our trade secrets and other proprietary information  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through means not currently foreseen 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative products that are equal or superior to our product candidates without infringing on any of our proprietary information or trade secrets 

table of contents our licensed patent covering the use of mifepristone to treat psychotic depression is a method of use patent rather than a composition of matter patent  which may make it more difficult for us to prove patent infringement if physicians prescribe another manufacturer s mifepristone for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or psychotic depression or if patients acquire mifepristone from other sources  such as the internet or black market 
we have an exclusive license from stanford university to a patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists  including mifepristone  for the treatment of psychotic depression 
a method of use patent covers only a specified use of a particular compound  not a particular composition of matter 
because none of our issued patents covers the composition of mifepristone  we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone in indications not covered by our method of use patents 
if others receive approval to manufacture and market mifepristone or any other gr ii antagonist  physicians could prescribe mifepristone or any other gr ii antagonist for patients with psychotic depression instead of mifepristone 
although any such off label use would violate our licensed patent  effectively monitoring compliance with our licensed patent may be difficult and costly 
in addition  if others develop a treatment for the psychotic features of psychotic depression that works through a mechanism which does not involve the gr ii receptor  physicians could prescribe that treatment instead of mifepristone 
in addition  we cannot be assured that patients will not obtain mifepristone from other sources 
as with other pharmaceutical products  patients may be able to purchase mifepristone through the internet or black market 
mifepristone is also sold in the united states by danco laboratories for the termination of early pregnancy 
while distribution is limited to a single dose provided in the physician s office and covered by other restrictions  we cannot be certain that cushing s syndrome patients will not be able to obtain mifepristone from this source or others  should another company receive approval to market mifepristone for another indication 
risks related to our stock the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to the limited number of shares of our common stock held by non affiliates or factors influencing the stock market and opportunities for sale at any given time may be limited 
we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will exist at any time 
holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active 
during the week period ended march   our average daily trading volume has been approximately  shares and the intra day sales prices per share of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market has ranged from to 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders control approximately of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the pace of market acceptance of korlym or the timing and level of reimbursement attained  our cash and short term investment position  actual or anticipated timing and results of our clinical trials  actual or anticipated regulatory approvals of our product candidates or of competing products  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates or our competitors products  changes in the expected or actual timing of our development programs or our competitors potential development programs  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  including potential product returns and timing of revenue recognition  announcements of technological innovations by us  our collaborators or our competitors  
table of contents new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors  general market and economic conditions  including those seen as a result of the recent worldwide financial credit crisis  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies  developments concerning collaborations  trading volume of our common stock  limited number of shares of our common stock held by our non affiliates  maintaining compliance with the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which we are listed  announcement of  or expectation of  additional financing efforts  and purchases or sales of our common stock by us  our officers  directors or our stockholders 
in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq capital market and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources 
securities analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports  and this may have a negative impact on our common stock s market price 
securities analysts currently covering our common stock may discontinue research coverage 
additional securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock 
a lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock  our stock price would likely decline rapidly and significantly 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  rules mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of  and a global settlement reached in between the sec  other regulatory analysts and a number of investment banks have led to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated 
in particular  many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research 
it may be difficult for companies such as ours with smaller market capitalizations to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock 
this could have a negative effect on our market price 

table of contents a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock 
as additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market  the supply of our common stock will increase  which could decrease the price 
substantially all of the shares of our common stock are eligible for sale  subject to applicable volume and other resale restrictions 
we may be required to pay significant amounts if we are not able to meet our obligations under our outstanding registration rights agreements 
the registration rights agreement covering the approximately million shares of our common stock issued in a private offering in march and an additional approximately million shares of common stock underlying warrants issued in connection with the offering provided that if we failed to file or cause to be declared effective the registration statement covering the resale of these shares prior to specified deadlines  or failed to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement subject to limited permissible suspension periods  we would be required to pay the holders of such shares and warrants liquidated damages at the rate of of the purchase price of these shares and warrants per month  up to a total of 
the registration statement covering the resale of the shares and shares underlying the warrants sold in this transaction was declared effective by the sec in november since this registration statement was not declared effective within the time frame specified in the registration rights agreement  we became obligated to pay liquidated damages of approximately million in to the investors in this financing 
as noted above  if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of this registration statement  we may be obligated to pay additional liquidated damage amounts in the future 
see the discussion above under risks related to our capital needs and financial results regarding risks associated with the ceff  including the risks regarding registration rights under that agreement 
if we are required to pay significant amounts under these or future registration rights agreements  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to finance our operations 
our officers  directors and principal stockholders  acting as a group  will be able to significantly influence corporate actions 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders control approximately of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control 
this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 
changes in laws and regulations may result in increased costs to us  which may harm our financial results 
new laws and regulations  as well as changes to existing laws and regulations  affecting public companies  including the provisions of the ppaca requiring the reporting of aggregate spending related to health care professionals  the provisions of sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted by the sec and by the nasdaq capital market have and will likely continue to result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements 
we are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in addition  new rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits 
table of contents and coverage or incur higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or our board committees  or as executive officers 
at present  we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs related to new rules and regulations or the timing of such costs 
compliance with public company obligations  including the securities laws and regulations  is costly and requires significant management resources  and we may fail to comply 
we are a small company with limited resources 
the federal securities laws and regulations  including the corporate governance and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting 
these requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  principal financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal compliance costs  increase the difficulty and expense in obtaining director and officer liability insurance  and make it harder for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and or qualified executive officers 
such developments could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
in addition  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
this requirement first applied to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  this same legislation also requires that the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
this requirement first applied to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  uncertainty exists regarding our ability to comply with these requirements by applicable deadlines and to maintain compliance in future years 
if we are unable to complete the required assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in future years or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of future year ends  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our accounting policies or operating practices 
accounting methods and policies for business and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies are subject to continual review  interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities  including the sec 
for example  in december  the financial accounting standards board adopted a revised standard related to stock based compensation 
this standard  which we adopted in  requires the recording of expense for stock options granted using fair value based measurements 
as a result  our operating expenses have increased and are likely to continue to increase 
we rely heavily on stock options to compensate existing employees and attract new employees 
because we are now required to expense stock options using fair value based measurements  we may choose to reduce our reliance on stock options as a compensation tool 
if we reduce our use of stock options  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
although we believe that our accounting practices are consistent with current accounting pronouncements  changes to or interpretations of accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to reclassify  restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements 
any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and income 
any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline 

table of contents if we fail to continue to meet all applicable nasdaq capital market requirements  our stock could be delisted by the nasdaq capital market 
if delisting occurs  it would adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and harm our business 
if we are unable to meet any of the nasdaq listing requirements in the future  including  for example  if the closing bid price for our common stock is below per share for consecutive trading days  the nasdaq capital market staff could determine to delist our common stock  the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease 
such delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more difficult  even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
some of these provisions divide our board into three classes with only a portion of our directors subject to election at each annual meeting  allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  require advance notification of stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent 
in addition  a supermajority vote of stockholders is required to amend our bylaws 
our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our chairman  president or the board of directors and that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
these provisions may prevent or delay a change in our board of directors or our management  which is appointed by our board of directors 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
section may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our charter  bylaws and under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

overview we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of severe metabolic and psychiatric disorders 
our focus is on those disorders that are associated with a steroid hormone called cortisol 
elevated levels and abnormal release patterns of cortisol have been implicated in a broad range of human disorders 
since our inception in may  we have been developing mifepristone  a potent glucocorticoid receptor ii gr ii antagonist  that blocks the activity of cortisol 
on february   the fda approved korlym mifepristone mg tablets in the united states as a once daily oral medication for treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery 
we have begun taking steps to commercialize the drug 
we also have an on going phase study of mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we have also discovered three series of novel selective gr ii antagonists and have moved a compound from one of these series into clinical development 
unless otherwise stated  all references in this document to we  us  our  corcept  the company  our company and similar designations refer to corcept therapeutics incorporated 
cushing s syndrome 
cushing s syndrome is a disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body s tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol 
sometimes called hypercortisolism  it is relatively uncommon and most often affects adults aged to an estimated to of every one million people are newly diagnosed with this syndrome each year  resulting in approximately  new patients and an estimated prevalence of  patients with cushing s syndrome in the united states 
we submitted an nda to the fda for korlym in april as discussed above  the fda approved the nda on february  this approval allows us to market korlym in the united states for hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery 
we are implementing our plans  including hiring a small number of medical science liaisons msls and engaging third party vendors  to launch korlym in the united states 
we have orphan drug designations for korlym from the fda for the approved indication and from the european commission for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome 
orphan drug designation is a special status granted by the fda to encourage the development of treatments for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than  patients in the united states 
drugs that receive orphan drug designation obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication from the date of drug approval  as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs  marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the fda in the drug development process 
benefits of orphan drug designation in the eu are similar to those in the us  but include ten years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication in all member states  free scientific advice 
table of contents during drug development  access to a centralized review process and a reduction or complete waiver of fees levied by the european medicines agency 
psychotic depression 
we are also developing mifepristone  the active ingredient in korlym  for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression under an exclusive patent license from stanford university 
the fda has granted fast track status to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
in march  we began enrollment in study  our ongoing phase trial in psychotic depression 
the protocol for this trial incorporates what we have learned from our three previously completed phase trials 
it attempts to address the established relationship between increased drug plasma levels and clinical response and attempts to decrease the random variability observed in the results of the psychometric instruments used to measure efficacy 
in one of the previously completed phase trials  study  we prospectively tested and confirmed that patients whose plasma levels rose above a predetermined threshold statistically separated from both those patients whose plasma levels were below the threshold and those patients who received placebo  this threshold was established from data produced in earlier studies 
as expected  the group of patients who took milligrams mg of mifepristone in study developed higher drug plasma levels than did the groups of patients who received lower doses 
further  there was no discernable difference in the incidence of adverse events between patients who received placebo in study and those who received mg  mg or mg of mifepristone in that study 
in august  we published our analysis of these data in the journal of clinical psychopharmacology 
based on this information  we are testing a mifepristone dose of mg once per day for seven days in study in addition  we are utilizing a third party centralized rating service to independently evaluate the patients for entry into the study as well as to evaluate their level of response throughout their participation in the study 
we believe the centralization of this process will improve the consistency of rating across clinical trial sites and reduce the background statistical noise that was observed in earlier studies and is endemic to psychopharmacologic studies 
we believe that this change in dose  as well as the other modifications to the protocol  should allow us to demonstrate the efficacy of mifepristone in the treatment of the psychotic symptoms of psychotic depression 
in mid  to conserve financial resources  we reduced the number of clinical sites in this study to eight and extended the timeline for its completion 
antipsychotic induced weight gain mitigation 
in  we announced the results of studies in rats that demonstrated that mifepristone both reversed the weight gain associated with the ongoing use of olanzapine and mitigated the weight gain associated with the initiation of treatment with olanzapine the active ingredient in zyprexa 
the results from this study were published in the journal brain behavioral research in early this study was paid for by eli lilly and company eli lilly 
during  we announced positive results from our clinical proof of concept study in lean healthy male volunteers evaluating the ability of mifepristone to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa 
the results showed a statistically significant reduction in weight gain in those subjects who took zyprexa plus mifepristone compared to those who took zyprexa plus placebo 
also  the addition of mifepristone to treatment with zyprexa had a beneficial impact on secondary metabolic measures such as fasting insulin  triglycerides and abdominal fat  as indicated by waist circumference 
eli lilly provided zyprexa and financial support for this study  the results of which were published in the journal advances in therapy in in january  we announced positive results from a similar proof of concept study evaluating the ability of mifepristone to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of johnson johnson s risperdal 
this study confirmed and extended the earlier results seen with mifepristone and zyprexa  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in weight gain and in the secondary metabolic endpoints of fasting insulin  triglycerides and abdominal fat  as indicated by waist circumference 
the results from the study of mifepristone and risperdal were presented at several scientific conferences  including the american diabetes association meeting in june  and were published in the journal obesity in 
table of contents the combination of zyprexa or risperdal and mifepristone is not approved for any indication 
the purpose of these studies was to explore the hypothesis that gr ii antagonists  such as mifepristone and our next generation of selective gr ii antagonists  would mitigate weight gain associated with antipsychotic medications 
the group of medications known as second generation antipsychotic medication  including zyprexa  risperdal  clozaril and seroquel  are widely used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
all medications in this group are associated with treatment emergent weight gain of varying degrees and carry a warning in their labels relating to treatment emergent hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus 
selective gr ii receptor antagonists 
in  we initiated a discovery research program to identify and patent selective gr ii antagonists with the intent of developing a pipeline of products for proprietary use 
three distinct series of gr ii antagonists were identified 
these compounds  like our lead product candidate mifepristone  potently block the cortisol receptor gr ii but  unlike mifepristone  they do not appear to block the pr progesterone  er estrogen  ar androgen or gr i mineralocorticoid receptors 
both the united states patent trademark office uspto and the european patent office epo have issued to us composition of matter patents on all of the three series 
a fourth composition of matter patent application is pending 
several of our new compounds have demonstrated positive results in animal models for the prevention and reversal of anti psychotic induced weight gain 
one of them  cort  is in phase b a clinical trial 
see part i  item  business next generation selective gr ii antagonists for the prevention and reversal of anti psychotic induced weight gain 
we have identified other selective gr ii antagonists from our proprietary series that we believe may have utility as therapeutic agents in a variety of diseases 
our intent is to continue our discovery research program with the goal of identifying new selective gr ii antagonists and to perform manufacturing and pre clinical development on one or more of these compounds and to submit inds with respect to the most promising of them  as we deem appropriate 
at the american diabetes association conference in june  there was also a presentation of preclinical data from another study of cort conducted at stanford university 
this study demonstrated that cort suppresses body weight gain and improves insulin sensitivity in healthy mice fed a fat diet and high sucrose liquid 
the results of these preclinical data were published in april in the journal nutrition and metabolism 
the manufacturing and preclinical development of cort began late in and resulted in the submission of an ind to the fda in december for the prevention of weight gain induced by antipsychotic medication 
phase b a studies of this drug are in progress 
in addition  we are continuing research and pre clinical efforts to identify additional selective gr ii antagonists for clinical study 
general our activities to date have included product development  including designing  funding and overseeing clinical trials and conducting non clinical activities such as toxicological testing  discovery research  regulatory affairs  intellectual property prosecution and expansion  and preparations for the commercialization of our lead product candidate 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of our preferred and common stock and the public sale of common stock rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
therefore  we have no research funding or collaborative payments payable to us 

table of contents our primary activities since incorporation have been raising capital  performing business and financial planning  establishing our offices  recruiting personnel  conducting research and development  overseeing clinical trials  and preparing for the commercialization of our product  korlym 
accordingly  we are considered to be in the development stage 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for mifepristone and cort  discovery research  non clinical activities such as toxicology and carcinogenicity studies  manufacturing process development and regulatory activities  as well as general and administrative expenses  including preparations for the commercial launch of korlym 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over at least the next few years as we continue our mifepristone and other clinical development programs  apply for regulatory approvals  continue discovery and initiate development of other selective gr ii antagonists for various indications  acquire and or develop treatments in other therapeutic areas  establish sales and marketing capabilities and expand our operations 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of our mifepristone and other clinical trials  uncertainties associated with securing financing  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  our investment in manufacturing set up  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
our ability to successfully generate revenues in the foreseeable future is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to finance our operations and develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture and market our lead product 
results of operations collaboration revenue collaboration revenue relates to services rendered in connection with our agreements with eli lilly discussed above under the caption overview antipsychotic induced weight gain mitigation 
under these agreements  eli lilly agreed to supply the zyprexa and olanzapine and pay for the costs of the studies 
we were required to perform development activities as specified in the agreements and we were reimbursed based on the costs associated with the conduct of the trial and the preparation and packaging of clinical trial materials 
revenue was recognized as the services were rendered in accordance with the agreements 
we did not recognize any revenue under the agreements during any period in or and none will be recognized in the future as we completed all of the activities relating to these agreements by mid research and development expenses research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities  including facilities costs and non cash stock based compensation  the costs of discovery research  costs associated with ind enabling activities and pre clinical studies  costs of clinical trials  including trial preparation  enrollment  site monitoring and data management and analysis expenses  regulatory costs  the costs of manufacturing development  the costs of manufacture and or acquisition of clinical trial materials and material used in registration and validation batches included in the nda submission for korlym and other costs associated with the preparation and prosecution of the nda 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the comparable period in for the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in  there were net increases of approximately million in consultancy costs which included the following a approximately  related to the development of the risk evaluation and mitigation system rems that was included in the korlym nda  b approximately  related to the preparation  submission and prosecution of the nda  c 
approximately  related to the development of a medical safety program  d  related to manufacturing and quality control activities to prepare for commercialization and e approximately  in non cash stock based compensation costs related to a performance based award to a consultant that vested in june upon the filing of our nda for korlym by the fda 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in consulting fees in other clinical activities of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  there was also an increase of approximately  related to attendance of seminars in support of our cushing s syndrome program 

table of contents korlym manufacturing costs increased approximately million during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  due primarily to the acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredient for korlym and the initiation of manufacturing development work at a potential back up site for the manufacture of korlym that were only partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing activities related to our proprietary  selective new gr ii antagonists 
there were net decreases in clinical trial costs of approximately million during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period of clinical trial cost decreases included a approximately million related to drug drug interaction and other nda supportive studies with korlym that were substantially completed during  b approximately  related to the clinical trials with korlym for the treatment of cushing s syndrome due to patients having completed the initial study and moving into the long term extension study and c approximately  related to the clinical trial with mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression 
during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  there was a decrease of approximately  related to clinical studies activities and a decrease of approximately  related to the ind enabling work on cort  as that product was moved into the clinic during research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  clinical trial costs increases during  as compared to  included approximately  related to the clinical trials with korlym for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  million related to other nda supportive studies with korlym and approximately million related to the phase a study with cort these increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately million related to scaling back our phase study with mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression  and approximately  related to the study for the mitigation of weight gain caused by risperdal  which was completed in during  as compared to  there were also increases of approximately million in research work with our proprietary  selective new gr ii antagonists and approximately  in mifepristone manufacturing costs related to the acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredient and the manufacture of clinical trial materials and registration batches to be used for the nda 
there was also an increase of approximately  related to the start of manufacturing of clinical trial material for use in the phase b a study with cort also  during  we recorded an aggregate amount of approximately  related to bonuses awarded to employees working in research and development functions in recognition of significant company accomplishments during bonus amounts during were negligible 
in addition  consultancy and staffing costs increased approximately  during as compared to  due to the additional resources necessary to assist in the management of the research and development activities  and to commence activities toward a submission of an nda for korlym in during as compared to  there was also a decrease of approximately million  related to the preclinical and ind enabling work on cort  which entered a phase a study in february research and development expenses discussed above included stock based compensation charges related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in expense between and included approximately  related to a performance based award to a consultant that vested in june upon the filing of our nda for korlym by the fda  the remainder of the increase was due to the award of additional grants to employees working in these functions 
the decrease in expense between and was primarily the result of the completion of vesting of earlier grants to employees in these functions with higher exercise prices and fair values that were not fully offset by the costs related to more recent option grants to existing and new employees in these functions

research and development expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on the availability of additional funds to finance clinical development plans 
see also  liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  as a result of the receipt from the fda of marketing approval of korlym in february discussed in overview above  research and development expenses for will also include compensation expense related to the award by the board of directors of bonuses to employees working in these functions of approximately  including payroll taxes 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our trials including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects in study patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of the drug in our trials 
the cost and timing of development of our selective gr ii antagonists will be dependent on our success in the effort and any difficulties that may be encountered 
in addition  the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our product candidates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of administrative personnel and related facility costs along with legal  accounting and other professional fees and the costs of executing on our commercial plans related to korlym  including conducting market research and engaging third party vendors to provide market analytics and to support distribution and other logistical needs related to our commercialization of korlym 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  during  we had recorded an aggregate amount of million related to bonuses awarded to our officers and employees working in general and administrative functions in recognition of significant company accomplishments during we did not award bonuses for performance to any officer or employee in these functions 
in addition  during  as compared to  staffing and consultancy costs increased approximately million due primarily to additional resources necessary to engage in preparations for the potential commercialization of korlym 
approximately  of this increase represented increases in noncash stock based compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees  directors and consultants

we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in as compared to in regard to activities directly associated with product commercialization and the need to increase our administrative infrastructure to support these activities 
the level of general and administrative activities and related expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on our assessment of the staff necessary to support product commercialization and our continued clinical development activities and the availability of additional funds 
see also  liquidity and capital resources 
as a result of the receipt from the fda of marketing approval of korlym in february discussed in overview above  general and administrative expenses for will also include compensation expense related to the award by the board of directors of bonuses to officers and employees working in these functions of approximately million  including payroll taxes  and the recognition of approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expense related to the vesting of performance based stock option awards to officers for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
we also anticipate that there will be increases in stock based compensation costs related to the issuance of awards to personnel hired in connection with our expanding commercial  finance and other infrastructure activities 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net of investment management fees  was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in and  in other income in was comprised of income on stockholder notes 
other income in had included  in connection with the favorable settlement of a lawsuit brought on our behalf against an individual for defamation and harassment and approximately  in grants from the united states treasury s therapeutic discovery project grant program 
interest income in included approximately  related to the note receivable in connection with our march financing  which was collected in february other expense other expense for the year ended december  was approximately  in and in  as compared to  in other expense consists primarily of a state tax on capital  which is based on our capital and asset positions as of each year end 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and at december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on the proceeds from public and private sales of our equity securities to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of our research and development activities  including efforts toward the submission and prosecution of the nda for korlym  and amounts incurred to develop our administrative infrastructure  including the increased infrastructure that will be necessary to support the commercialization of korlym 
in january  we sold million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriter s discount and commissions and other expenses related to this offering 
during the course of  we received approximately  from the exercise of stock option awards resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock at an average exercise price of 
on july   we issued  shares of common stock to an investor upon the exercise of warrants that had been issued in our april warrant transaction and our march financing  for an average exercise price of approximately per share  receiving aggregate proceeds of approximately  we expect cash used in operating activities to increase during as compared to spending levels in due to the commercialization of korlym  the continuation of our phase clinical trial of mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression and the continued development of our selective gr ii antagonists 
in addition  as a result of the receipt from the fda of marketing approval of korlym discussed in overview above in february  the board of directors authorized the payment of bonuses to officers and employees approximately million  including payroll taxes 
we expect our funding requirements for operating activities may increase during later years as costs associated with the continuation and expansion of our development programs for cushing s syndrome  psychotic depression and our selective gr ii antagonists  research activities  commercialization activities and general and administrative expenses may be only partially offset by revenues from sales of korlym 
we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to maintain our operations through the end of  including the launch of korlym  the continuation of enrollment in our phase psychotic depression trial  the completion of our current phase b a multi dose safety and proof of concept clinical studies for cort and research and pre clinical activities related to additional selective gr ii antagonists 
we may need to raise additional funds to support the continued development of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and continue and expand the development of our proprietary selective gr ii antagonists beyond the end of we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  including potentially our lead product candidate that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations 

table of contents in march  we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge 
under the terms of the agreement  kingsbridge committed to provide up to million of capital in exchange for newly issued shares of our common stock for a period of up to three years after the sec declares effective the registration statements filed by us covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the ceff and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
in june  the sec declared effective our registration statement with the sec covering the resale of approximately million of the shares issuable under the ceff and the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
this registration statement covers approximately of the million shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff and all of the  shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
as of the filing of this report  approximately million shares remain available for sale under the initial registration statement 
we intend to file an additional registration statement covering the resale of the remaining million shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff approximately days after kingsbridge and its affiliates have resold substantially all of the securities registered for sale under this initial registration statement 
under the terms of the agreement  the determination of the exact timing and amount of any ceff financings will be made solely by us  subject to certain conditions 
the agreement currently requires a minimum stock price of per share to allow us to issue shares to kingsbridge under the ceff 
through december   we have raised a total of approximately million from the sales of stock under the ceff 
based on the volume weighted average price on the nasdaq capital market for our common stock for the period from march   the date of the signing of the kingsbridge ceff  through march   the maximum amount of additional funds that could be raised under the ceff is approximately million 
the actual amount of funds that can be raised under this agreement will be dependent on the number of shares actually sold under the agreement and the market value of our stock during the pricing periods of each sale 
while we monitor the cash balance in our checking account and transfer the funds in only as needed  these cash balances and our money market fund could be impacted if the underlying financial institution were to fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our checking accounts or money market fund 
as a result of volatile market conditions over the past few years  the cost and availability of capital has been and may again be adversely affected by illiquid capital markets 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers 
renewed or increased turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and declines in business or consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  including our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our estimates of obligations under contractual agreements as of december  contractual obligations less than year years years more than years in thousands research and development studies through operating lease minimum royalty payments per year total   per year amounts reflected for research and development studies exclude amounts included in accounts payable and accrued clinical costs reflected on the balance sheet as of december  
table of contents during  we entered into agreements for services in connection with our ongoing phase trial to confirm the utility of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
the total commitment under these original agreements was approximately million 
in june  we amended these agreements to reduce the amounts of commitments with these organizations by approximately million in accordance with the reduction in the near term scope of activities under this trial 
the total commitment under these agreements  including additional amendments through  is now estimated to be approximately million over the course of the trial 
however  we view the reduction in these commitments as a temporary measure as it is our intent to continue the conduct of this trial to its conclusion  when sufficient capital is available for this purpose 
approximately million of these costs were expensed through december   with the remainder to be incurred over the course of the trial 
under the master services agreements with these vendors  the project contracts may be terminated upon thirty to sixty days notice 
if terminated early  we would be responsible for the costs incurred by the vendors through the effective date of termination plus cancellation charges as stipulated in the agreements 
during and  we entered into agreements for the conduct of the initial clinical trials using cort the total commitment under these agreements is approximately million 
approximately million of costs under these agreements have been incurred as of december   with the remainder expected to be incurred during during october  we executed agreements with contract research organizations for the conduct of two additional clinical studies with korlym for total commitments of approximately million 
approximately  of these costs were incurred during  with the remainder to be incurred during in november  we renewed the operating lease agreement for our office facility for a one year term commencing on january   with an option to extend for one additional year 
under our cancellable license agreement with stanford university  we are obligated to make nonrefundable minimum royalty payments of  annually for as long as we maintain our licenses with stanford  however  these payments are creditable against future royalties 
we also have other contractual payment obligations and purchase commitments  the timing of which are contingent on future events 
a under our license agreement with stanford university related to the patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychosis associated with psychotic depression and early dementia  we are obligated to make milestone payments to stanford of  upon filing of an nda covering a licensed product and  upon fda approval of a licensed product 
the milestone payments payable to stanford under these licenses are creditable against future royalties 
b under the agreement with our contract research company we may be obligated to make milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events  including i patent filings in connection with the project  ii entries into phase clinical trials  and iii national regulatory approval of each product arising from work performed under the agreement  provided that sales of the product by the company or any future licensees reach  these obligations remain in force after the conclusion of work under the agreement 
there are no royalty obligations associated with this contract 
c pursuant to our memorandum of understanding with scinopharm  scinopharm agrees to manufacture api for mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression and we agree to purchase at least  bulk mifepristone per year following the commercial launch of mifepristone in that indication 
d in november  we entered into an agreement with pcas for the manufacture of mifepristone  the api in korlym  for our development and commercial needs for an initial period of five years 
the agreement provides for an automatic extension for one additional year 
we intend to pursue discussions to continue the relationship thereafter 
after nda approval  the agreement calls for us to purchase from pcas of our requirements for six months immediately following approval and  thereafter  through the expiration of the agreement 
if pcas is unable to manufacture the product for a consecutive six month period  we have the right to terminate the agreement without penalty 
net operating loss carryforwards at december  we had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset any future taxable income that we may generate for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through  and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through we also had federal and california research and development tax credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will expire in the years through and the california research credits have no expiration date 
our deferred tax assets have been offset by a full valuation allowance as the realization of such assets is uncertain 
utilization of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accruals of research and development costs we recorded accruals for estimated costs of research  pre clinical and clinical studies  and manufacturing development of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period 
accrued clinical trial costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts and service providers 
our estimate of the work completed  and associated costs to be accrued  includes our assessment of the information received from our third party contract research organizations and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
in the past  we have not experienced any material deviations between accrued and actual clinical trial expenses 
however  actual services performed  number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates  resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expense in future periods 
stock based compensation stock based compensation arises from the granting of stock options to employees and directors  as well as to non employees 
employees and directors our accounting practices and the estimates and judgments that are considered in determining fair value in regard to stock option grants to employees and directors are as follows options granted subsequent to january  compensation expense is being recorded in the financial statements based on the fair value on the date of grant as determined utilizing the black scholes option valuation model 
for options granted from january  through september  the expected term used in determining the fair value for options was based on the simplified method prescribed by the sec that considers the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual life of the options 
for options granted since september for which we can no longer use the simplified method  the expected term has been based on a formula that considers the expected service period and expected post vesting termination behavior differentiated by whether the grantee is an employee  an officer or a director 
the expected volatility of our common stock used in determining the fair value of option grants to employees  officers and directors is based on a weighted average combination of the volatility of our own stock price and that of a group of peer companies for those grants with expected terms longer than the period of time that we have been a public company 
for stock options granted to employees with expected terms of less than the period of time that we have been a public company  the volatility is based on historical data of the price for our common stock for periods of time equivalent to the expected term of these grants 

table of contents for service based awards  expense is recognized over the requisite service period utilizing the straight line amortization method 
for options with performance based vesting criteria  expense will be recognized at such time as there is a high degree of probability ie  greater than of achieving the required vesting criteria 
since we have a limited employee base and have experienced minimal turnover  we do not have sufficient historical information to determine a reasonable forfeiture rate for options that might not vest because of employee terminations and  therefore  do not apply a forfeiture rate 
when an employee terminates  we will record a change in accounting estimate that represents the difference between the expense recorded in the financial statements and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individual s service as an employee 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense for employee and director options outstanding as of that date 
approximately million of the unrecognized compensation relates to option grants with service based vesting criteria  which had a remaining weighted average vesting period of years 
approximately million of the unrecognized compensation relates to option grants with performance based vesting criteria  which will be expensed in the first quarter of as a result of the approval by the fda of our nda for korlym 
non employees all stock option grants to consultants vest solely based upon continuing service  with the exception of a performance based award granted during  in the amount of  shares 
stock based compensation related to service based option grants to non employees is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options  which approximates the period over which the related services are rendered  based on the fair value of the options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used for the determination of fair value for options granted to employees  with the exception that  for non employee options  we are required to use the remaining contractual term as the life of the option and the fair value related to unvested non employee options is re measured quarterly  based on the then current stock price as reflected on the nasdaq capital market 
the grant with performance based vesting criteria awarded in vested in its entirety upon the filing by the fda of the company s nda for korlym in june  resulting in a charge of approximately  based on the fair value of the grant as of the date of vesting  as determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds maintained at major us financial institutions 
to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  we have limited the maturities of our investments to less than two years with an average maturity not to exceed one year 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december
