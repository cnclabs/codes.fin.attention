item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview surgical for additional information regarding this potential dispute 
attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future 
we will consider the acquisition of other businesses 
however  we may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future  which could negatively impact the growth of our business 
in order to pursue such opportunities  we may require significant additional financing  which may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the availability of such financing is limited by the continued tightening of the global credit markets 
we expect that our competitors  many of which have significantly greater resources than we do  will compete with us to acquire compatible businesses 
this competition could increase prices for acquisitions that we would likely pursue 
sales of our products are largely dependent upon third party reimbursement and our performance may be harmed by health care cost containment initiatives 
in the us and other markets  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians  that purchase health care products  such as our products  generally rely on third party payers  including medicare  medicaid and other health insurance and managed care plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the health care product 
we depend upon the distributors for our products to secure reimbursement and reimbursement approvals 
reimbursement by third party payers may depend on a number of factors  including the payer s determination that the use of our products is clinically useful and cost effective  medically necessary and not experimental or investigational 
since reimbursement approval is required from each payer individually  seeking such approvals can be a time consuming and costly process which  in the future  could require us or our marketing partners to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payer separately 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and any failure or delay in obtaining reimbursement approvals can negatively impact sales of our new products 
in addition  third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain the costs of health care products and services by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products and by refusing in some cases to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
also  congress and certain state legislatures have considered reforms that may affect current reimbursement practices  including controls on health care spending through limitations on the growth of medicare and medicaid spending 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement coverage will be available or adequate for any products or services developed by us 
outside the us  the success of our products is also dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement and health care payment systems 
domestic and international reimbursement laws and regulations may change from time to time 
lack of adequate coverage and reimbursement provided by governments and other third party payers for our products and services  including change of classification by cms for orthovisc under a unique j code for medicare medicaid reimbursement  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may seek financing in the future  which could be difficult to obtain and which could dilute your ownership interest or the value of your shares 
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  however  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the success and sales of our products under various distributor agreements  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such product development efforts  any potential acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses  progress with preclinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of our efforts to manage our manufacturing capabilities and related costs  the cost and timing of validation and approval processes for our new manufacturing space  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the cost of defending any other legal proceeding  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  the terms of such strategic alliances  including provisions and our ability to satisfy such provisions that provide upfront and or milestone payments to us  our abilities to meet debt covenant and repayment requirements  and the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands 
to the extent funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to you and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants  which limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
we are subject to debt covenants and any failure to comply with these could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on january   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  our lender made periodic loans to us through december  we borrowed  in  the maximum allowed amount under the credit agreement 
at december   the borrowings were converted into a year term loan 
on december   the credit agreement was amended as part of the anika srl acquisition 
the credit agreement was entered into in order to finance the construction and validation of our bedford facility 
construction of the new facility commenced in the spring of and was substantially completed in mid validation of our new manufacturing facility will continue into see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relative to this debt facility 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in qualifying the new facility under the fda regulations for our ophthalmic products 
the credit agreement contains certain debt covenants  representations and warranties with which we must comply 
if we do not comply with the specified covenants and restrictions  we could be in default under our credit agreement 
our ability to comply with the provisions of our credit agreement governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
we could become subject to product liability claims  which  if successful  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the testing  marketing and sale of human health care products entail an inherent risk of allegations of product liability  and there can be no assurance that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against us 
although we have not received any material product liability claims to date and have an insurance policy of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate to cover such claims should they arise  there can be no assurance that material claims will not arise in the future or that our insurance will be adequate to cover all situations 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such insurance  or additional insurance  if required  will be available in the future or  if available  will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
any product liability claim  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon hiring and retaining qualified management and technical personnel 
we are highly dependent on the members of our management and technical staff  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have experienced a number of management changes in recent years 
there can be no assurances that such management changes will not adversely affect our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled  technical  managerial and manufacturing personnel 
we face significant competition for such personnel from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining the personnel we require 
the failure to hire and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to environmental regulations and any failure to comply with applicable laws could subject us to significant liabilities and harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of local  state  federal and foreign government regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic  or other hazardous substances used in the manufacture of our products 
any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of hazardous chemicals or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as our international sales and operations grow  including through our acquisition of anika srl  we could become increasingly subject to additional economic  political and other risks that could harm our business 
since we manufacture and sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
during the years ended december  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our product sales were to international distributors 
as a result of this international growth  we have become increasingly subject to a variety of risks  which could cause fluctuations in the results of our international and domestic operations 
these risks include the impact of recessions and other economic conditions in economies  including europe in particular  outside the united states  sovereign risk associated with doing business with government financed healthcare hospitals and institutions in italy  instability of foreign economic  political and labor conditions  unfavorable labor regulations applicable to european operations  such as severance and the unenforceability of non competition agreements in the european union  the impact of strikes  work stoppages  work slowdowns  grievances  complaints  claims of unfair labor practices or other collective bargaining disputes  difficulties in complying with restrictions imposed by regulatory or market requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by us export laws  imposition of governmental controls limiting the volume of international sales  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  including  if required  difficulties transferring funds generated in non us jurisdictions to the us in a tax efficient manner  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  difficulties in managing international operations  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and address these risks 
we cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a negative impact on our reported earnings 
approximately of our business during fiscal year was conducted in functional currencies other than the us dollar  which is our reporting currency 
thus  currency fluctuations among the us dollar and the other currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
in the future  we may undertake to manage foreign currency risk through additional hedging methods 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in managing foreign currency risk or in predicting the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
our stock price has been and may remain highly volatile  and we cannot assure you that market making in our common stock will continue 
the market price of shares of our common stock may be highly volatile 
factors such as announcements of new commercial products or technological innovations by us or our competitors  disclosure of results of clinical testing or regulatory proceedings  governmental regulation and approvals  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the health care industry generally or in the medical products industry specifically  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical products companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of equity research analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
no person is under any obligation to make a market in the common stock or to publish research reports on us  and any person making a market in the common stock or publishing research reports on us may discontinue market making or publishing such reports at any time without notice 
there can be no assurance that an active public market in our common stock will be sustained 
our charter documents contain anti takeover provisions that may prevent or delay an acquisition of us 
certain provisions of our restated articles of organization and amended and restated by laws could have the effect of discouraging a third party from pursuing a non negotiated takeover of us and preventing certain changes in control 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  advance notice to the board of directors of stockholder proposals  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors and to call stockholder meetings  the provision that vacancies on the board of directors be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors 
in addition  the board of directors renewed a shareholders rights plan in april we are also subject to chapter f of the massachusetts general laws which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a massachusetts corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
these provisions could discourage a third party from pursuing a takeover of us at a price considered attractive by many stockholders  since such provisions could have the effect of preventing or delaying a potential acquirer from acquiring control of us and our board of directors 
our revenues are derived from a small number of customers  the loss of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers  most of whom resell our products to end users and most of whom are significantly larger companies than us 
for the year ended december   five customers accounted for of product revenue 
we expect to continue to be dependent on a small number of large customers for the majority of our revenues 
revenue generated under our new agreement with b l may be significantly less than under the prior arrangement 
our failure to generate as much revenue as expected from these customers or the failure of these customers to purchase our products would seriously harm our business 
in addition  if present and future customers terminate their purchasing arrangements with us  significantly reduce or delay their orders  or seek to renegotiate their agreements on terms less favorable to us  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we accept terms less favorable than the terms of the current agreement  such renegotiations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
furthermore  in any future negotiations we may be subject to the perceived or actual leverage that these customers may have given their relative size and importance to us 
any termination  change  reduction or delay in orders could seriously harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
accordingly  unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base  our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our largest customers and the financial and operational success of these customers 
the loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues  harm our reputation in the industry  and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow  and  as a consequence  could seriously harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 
in december  we acquired anika srl which we accounted for as a business combination 
we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations or technologies that we may acquire 
in addition  the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex  costly  and time consuming and include unanticipated issues  expenses and liabilities 
we may have difficulty in developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies 
following an acquisition  we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition 
acquisitions may also result in one time charges  such as write offs or restructuring charges  or in the future  impairment of goodwill or acquired ipr d  which adversely affect our operating results 
additionally  we may fund acquisitions of new businesses  strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash  incurring debt  issuing shares of our common stock  or by other means 
information security breaches or business system disruptions may adversely affect our business 
we rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to effectively run our business 
we may be subject to information security breaches caused by illegal hacking  computer viruses  or acts of vandalism or terrorism 
our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such breaches 
any such compromise to our information security could result in an interruption in our operations  the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information  the unauthorized release of customer  vendor  or employee data  the violation of privacy or other laws  and the exposure to litigation  any of which could harm our business and operating results

we submitted additional data and analyses throughout  and were informed by the fda that deficiencies remained 
acting on an option presented by the fda to resolve the remaining open issues  anika requested a review by the orthopedic advisory panel 
the fda has denied our request for an orthopedic advisory panel review of the product  and we are now moving to the next level in the appeal process structure of the fda to seek an objective review of the scientific and clinical data 
we continue to believe in monovisc and the strength of our data  and that monovisc should receive fda approval 
our second single injection osteoarthritis product under development is cingal  which is based on our hyaluronic acid material with an added active therapeutic molecule to provide broad pain relief for a long period of time 
during the past year  we have integrated the research and development efforts of anika and anika srl  and prioritized our new product development activities 
business developments in january of  we received fda approval to sell orthovisc  hyvisc  and incert manufactured in our bedford plant  and expect to receive approval to manufacture our ophthalmic products in the bedford facility sometime in the first half of  and thereafter close our woburn  ma facility 
our bedford facility is approved to manufacture all our ce marked products 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we monitor our estimates on an on going basis for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  foreign currency translation the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is the euro 
assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are translated using the exchange rate existing on each respective balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the monthly average exchange rates prevailing throughout the year 
the translation adjustments resulting from this process are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability  such as inherent risk  transfer restrictions  and risk of nonperformance 
the accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
a financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level instruments include securities traded on active exchange markets  such as the new york stock exchange 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions  accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
work in process and finished goods inventories include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
the company s policy is to write down inventory when conditions exist that suggests inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
the company regularly evaluates the ability to realize the value of inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  and estimated current or future market values 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
revenue recognition general we recognize revenue from product sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
product revenue revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  which is typically upon shipment to the customer 
amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
when determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales  or if the sales price is fixed or determinable  the company evaluates both the contractual terms and conditions of its distribution and supply agreements as well as its business practices 
product revenue also includes royalties 
royalty revenue is based on our distributors sales and recognized in the same period our distributors record their sale of products manufactured by us 
on a quarterly basis we record royalty revenue based upon sales projections provided to us by our distributor customers 
if necessary we adjust our estimates based upon final sales data received prior to issuing our annual audited financial statements 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue licensing  milestone  and contract revenue consists of revenue recognized on initial and milestone payments  as well as contractual amounts received from partners 
the company s business strategy includes entering into collaborative license  development and or supply agreements with partners for the development and commercialization of the company s products 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  and payments based upon achievement of certain milestones 
the company adopted accounting standards update  revenue recognition  in january  which amends asc subtopic  multiple element arrangements asc require the establishment of a selling price hierarchy for determining the allocable selling price of an item 
under asc  as amended by asu  in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting  the element must have objective and reliable evidence of selling price of the undelivered elements 
in general  non refundable upfront fees and milestone payments that do not relate to other elements are recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
computer hardware and software are typically amortized over three to five years  and furniture and fixtures over three to eight years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining terms of the related leases 
property and equipment under capital leases are amortized over the lesser of the lease terms or their estimated useful lives 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred  additions and improvements are capitalized 
when an item is sold or retired  the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved  and the resulting gain or loss  if any  is recognized in income 
goodwill and acquired in process research and development goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price of acquired net assets in a business combination exceeded the fair values of net identifiable assets on the date of acquisition 
acquired in process research and development ipr d represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquire that have not been completed at the date of acquisition or are pending regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions 
the value assigned to acquired ipr d is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting revenue from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to present value 
goodwill and ipr d are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
factors we consider important  on an overall company basis  that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
to conduct impairment tests of goodwill  the fair value of the acquired reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we estimate the fair value for reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to risk free rate of return on an investment  weighted average cost of capital  future revenue  operating margin  working capital and capital expenditure needs 
our annual assessment for impairment of goodwill as of november  indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
anika srl is our only acquired reporting unit and currently holds of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of that company 
there can be no assurance that  at the time future impairment tests are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
to conduct impairment tests of ipr d  the fair value of the ipr d projects is compared to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of the ipr d project exceeds its fair value 
we estimate the fair values for ipr d projects using discounted cash flow valuation models which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed projects and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates 
our annual assessment for impairment of ipr d indicated that the fair value of our ipr d as of november  exceeded their respective carrying values 
there can be no assurance that  at the time future impairment tests are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
long lived assets long lived assets primarily include property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives including purchased software and trade names 
purchased software is amortized over to years and trade names are amortized over years 
we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
stock based compensation we measure the compensation cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the underlying award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the types of stock based awards granted  the compensation expense related to such awards  and detail of equity based awards outstanding 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details relative to the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for stock based compensation 
income taxes our income tax expense includes us and international income taxes 
certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year 
the tax effects of these differences are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit carry forwards 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income loss  which includes foreign currency translation adjustments 
for the purposes of comprehensive income disclosures  we do not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in the foreign currency translation adjustment  as we intend to reinvest permanently undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss is reported as a component of stockholders equity and  as of december  and  was comprised solely of cumulative translation adjustment losses 
segment information operating segments  as defined under us gaap  are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the company s chief operating decision maker is its chief executive officer 
based on the criteria established by asc  segment reporting  the company has one reportable operating segment  the results of which are disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

year ended december  inc dec inc dec orthobiologics dermal ophthalmic surgical veterinary revenue from orthobiologics increased  or  in compared to the improvement in orthobiologics product revenue was due to increases in domestic orthovisc revenue  as well as increased sales of monovisc in europe  turkey and canada and anika srl s orthopedic revenue in europe 
our us joint health product revenue for increased compared to this increase reflects depuy mitek s continued market penetration to an estimated market share of in versus share in international orthobiologics product revenue in increased compared to the increase in international revenue was driven by higher product shipments to new and existing customers in eastern europe and the middle east  partially offset by continued weakness in sales in southern europe 
anika srl s orthopedic product revenue for increased compared to we expect orthobiologics revenue to increase in compared to  both domestically and internationally 
dermal revenue increased  or  in compared to the increase was primarily due to anika srl s advanced wound care products revenue which totaled  in as compared to  in aesthetic dermatology revenue was  for the year ended december   versus  for the prior year 
in july  our former us distributor  coapt  filed for protection from creditors and we terminated our agreement with them 
the aesthetics market is crowded with many large companies  and our sales expectations in this area are modest 
revenue from ophthalmic products in decreased  or  compared to revenue for these products in the decrease was primarily attributable to b l s plan to shift manufacturing to an alternative supplier 
b l accounted for of product revenue for the year ended  but is expected to be moderately lower in under a new  recently signed  three year contract  with further reductions in and operating margins under the expired b l agreement were low  and will remain at a similar level under the new contract 
sales of our surgical products increased  or  as compared to this product group consists primarily of anika srl s anti adhesion and ent products acquired in december the increase was attributable to increased sales of surgical and anti adhesion products by anika srl  mostly in europe and korea  coupled with a modest increase in the sale of incert 
our anti adhesion products include incert and hyalobarrier 
our leading ear  nose and throat care product is merogel 
anika srl is partnered with medtronic for worldwide distribution except for italy of its ent products 
we expect surgical product revenue to increase moderately in compared to veterinary revenue decreased  or  in as compared to sales of hyvisc are made to a single customer under an exclusive agreement which expires december  we expect hyvisc revenue to be relatively flat in compared to licensing  milestone and contract revenue 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for licensing and milestone revenue includes the ratable recognition of the  in up front and milestone payments related to the jnj agreement 
these amounts are being recognized in income ratably over the ten year expected life of the agreement  or  per year 
in december  the company entered into a fifteen year licensing and supply agreement with depuy mitek  inc  a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  to market monovisc in the us the company received an initial payment of  in december  which will be recognized ratably over the fifteen year term of the agreement as there was no stand alone value associated with this payment  thus up front recognition is prohibited 
the company is entitled to receive additional payments from depuy mitek  following fda approval and the mutual decision to launch the product  as well as payments related to future regulatory  clinical and sales milestones 
product gross profit and margin 
product gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product revenue  compared with  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in product gross profit was primarily due to improvements in anika s overall product sales mix  as compared to the prior year  with increasing sales of our orthobiologics products as a percent of our overall product sales being the primary driver 
the positive effect of the improved product sales mix was partially offset by the negative effect of the inventory write downs and duplicate manufacturing expenditures during the transition from the woburn facility to the company s bedford facility 
anika srl only manufactures the tissue engineered products and operates at a lower volume 
it outsources manufacturing of its medical devices to its former parent company  fidia farmaceutici  contributing to its current lower gross margins 
the company plans to transfer a significant portion of anika srl s medical device product manufacturing to its bedford location over the next two years  starting with the acp gel products in the second half of the company wrote down inventory by approximately  during related to the previously disclosed equipment problems  in addition to other production losses  experienced in our woburn facility 
looking forward  we expect a continued impact of duplicate facilities on our results during the first half as we complete the transition of operations from our woburn facility to our bedford facility 
commencing with final fda facility approval in  the bedford facility is expected to add in excess of million to annual depreciation expense once completely on line 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  as compared to the prior year 
r d as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher costs incurred in in connection with the company s us based clinical trials for monovisc 
this decrease was partially offset by the continued manufacturing validation activities at our bedford facility  as well as other continuing new product development projects in italy and the us we expect research and development expenses will increase significantly in and future years compared to with commencement of clinical studies for hyalograft c autograft and cingal  as well as new product development projects 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased by  or  as compared to this increase was primarily due to valuation losses associated with the re measurement of euro based assets into us dollars as the dollar strengthened in the second half of  in addition to higher legal fees  partially offset by operational streamlining at anika srl as we in sourced financial and administrative services from an outside service provider 
we expect general and administrative expenses for will increase modestly reflective of the support required to grow our business both domestically and internationally 
interest income  net 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december   as compared to  in the same period ended the modest decrease is the direct result of our continuing debt service and the decreasing principal balance in as compared to income taxes 
provisions for income taxes were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in effective tax rate in of  as compared to  is primarily due to decreased state tax expense  increased domestic production deductions resulting from increasing domestic taxable income  and improving financial results experienced by anika srl which has permitted the company to benefit more from the lower effective tax rate in italy 
a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending december is as follows year ended december  statutory federal income tax rate state tax expense  net of federal benefit permanent items  including nondeductible expenses state investment tax credit federal and state research and development credits foreign rate differential domestic production deduction tax expense during  the company concluded its audit by the internal revenue service irs for its tax return  with no changes made by the irs

anika srl currently operates at a lower volume and outsources most manufacturing to its former parent company  fidia  contributing to its current lower gross margins 
the company wrote down inventory by approximately  during related to aesthetic and joint health products due to the coapt bankruptcy and the delay in fda approval of monovisc 
as of december   non us monovisc and aesthetic product manufacturing had been moved to the bedford facility 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to the higher costs incurred in in connection with the company s us based clinical trials for monovisc  and the post marketing aesthetic dermatology people of color study during the year ended december  the monovisc clinical trial was completed in late this decrease was partially offset by the addition of r d costs at anika srl research and development during was primarily for manufacturing validation activities at our bedford facility  as well as other continuing new product development projects in italy and the us selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased by  or  to  from  in the prior year  which also includes million of acquisition related non recurring expenses in connection with our acquisition of anika srl the increase was primarily due to costs associated with the addition of anika srl to the company  including integration and infrastructure development costs  as well as costs related to the creation of monovisc marketing materials and reimbursement strategy consulting 
interest income  net

provisions for income taxes were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in effective tax rate in of  and difference from the us federal statutory rate  is primarily due to three factors the foreign rate differential associated with the net operating loss incurred by anika srl  lower r d spending in resulting in a decrease in the associated r d credit earned  and continued lower capital spending on the bedford facility resulting in lower state investment tax credits in during  the company concluded its audit by the massachusetts department of revenue dor for its and tax returns and the statute of limitations expired on certain other previously reserved positions 
net income 
for the year ended december  net income was  or per diluted share compared to  or per diluted share for the same period last year

liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses and to make capital expenditures 
we expect that our requirements for cash to fund these uses will increase as our operations expand 
historically we have funded our cash requirements from available cash and investments on hand 
we have spent approximately million to date on the build out of our bedford facility to expand our operations and capabilities 
in addition  in  we spent approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  in connection with the anika srl acquisition 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million compared to million  and working capital totaled approximately million and million  at december  and december   respectively 
the company believes it has adequate financial resources to support its business for the foreseeable future 
cash provided by operating activities was   and  for   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities increased by  in from the increase was attributable to increased profits as well as the receipt of million of the upfront fee from depuy mitek in connection with a licensing agreement for monovisc in the us these were partially offset by an increase in working capital requirements the most significant components of which were an increase in trade receivables and a decrease in trade payables for  as compared to cash used in investing activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities in was the result of the capital expenditures required to complete the build out of our bedford facility as we prepare to move the remaining manufacturing operations of our woburn facility to bedford 
construction at the bedford facility commenced in may and validation of the facility is expected to be completed by mid year cash used in financing activities was   and  for   and cash used was primarily due to the required principal payments on long term debt of million in each period  respectively 
also reflected in the cash provided by financing activities for all three years were proceeds from the exercise of stock options  including any associated tax benefits 
concentration of risk a significant portion of the company s accounts receivable arising from product sales within italy by anika srl are due from public hospitals and other government funded healthcare agencies 
as of december   the company s accounts receivable from all italian customers totaled approximately million of which public hospital and agency receivables were approximately million 
the history with our italian customers has been such that many of the public healthcare providers funded by the italian government have been slow to pay with several maintaining outstanding balances over one year past due 
the company continuously evaluates these accounts receivables for potential risks associated with  among other things  governmental funding and reimbursement practices 
we have established an allowance against the gross value of these trade receivables based upon specifically identifiable risks and other currently available information 
for customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year  revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection 
allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers  but have been immaterial to date 
the company will continue to work closely with these customers  monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition 
the purpose of this update is to provide guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in a revenue arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  requiring an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price  and eliminating the use of the residual method and requiring an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
adoption of this guidance effective january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued asu  a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring 
the provisions of asu provide additional guidance related to determining whether a creditor has granted a concession  include factors and examples for creditors to consider in evaluating whether a restructuring results in a delay in payment that is insignificant  prohibit creditors from using the borrower s effective borrowing rate test to evaluate whether a concession has been granted to the borrower  and add factors for creditors to use in determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties 
the provisions of asu are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
on may   the fasb  together with the international accounting standards board  jointly issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the provisions of asu give fair value the same meaning between us gaap and international financial reporting standards  and improve consistency of disclosures relating to fair value 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application by public entities is not permitted 
we believe the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments in this asu require all non owner changes in stockholders equity to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we believe the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other 
this asu s objective is to simplify the process of performing impairment testing for goodwill 
with this update a company is allowed to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not greater than that the fair value of its goodwill and intangible assets is less than the carrying amount 
this step is done prior to performing the two step goodwill impairment testing  as prescribed by topic this asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to date  we have limited commitments for purchases of inventories 
we have incurred significant capital investments related to the build out of our new facility in bedford  massachusetts  as well as the anika srl acquisition 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the success and sales of our products under current and future distribution agreements  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  any potential acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost of maintaining adequate manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  the terms of such strategic alliances  including provisions and our ability to satisfy such provisions that provide upfront and or milestone payments to us  the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands  the contractual obligation to make principal and interest debt payments  the successful integration of anika srl we cannot assure you that we will record profits in future periods 
to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners  or through other sources 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
see item a

our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing may be made available to us or may be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we did not utilize any derivative financial instruments  market risk sensitive instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under asc  financial instruments 
our investments consist of money market funds primarily invested in us treasury obligations and repurchase agreements secured by us treasury obligations  and municipal bonds that are carried on our books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and currency rate risk 
we have two supplier contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates would have a negative impact on our financial statements 
the impact of changes in currency exchange rates for the two contracts on our financial statements was immaterial in our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and long term debt are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   the company is subject to interest rate risk on million of variable rate debt 
the interest payable on our debt is determined based at the company s election on either an interest rate based on libor plus or the lender s prime rate and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
based on the outstanding debt amount as of december   we would have a decrease increase in future annual cash flow of approximately  for every increase decrease in the interest rate 
a significant portion of anika srl s revenue  and all operating expenses  are denominated in euros which leaves the company vulnerable to foreign exchange risk
