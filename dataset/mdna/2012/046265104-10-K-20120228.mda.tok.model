item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the following overview should be read in conjunction with our md a in its entirety 
as the premier long island community bank  our goals are to enhance shareholder value while building a solid banking franchise 
we focus on growing our core businesses of mortgage portfolio lending and retail banking while maintaining strong asset quality and controlling operating expenses 
we also provide returns to shareholders through dividends 
the economic conditions in which we operate continued to be challenging through while there has been moderate job growth during and the national unemployment rate declined to for december  compared to one year earlier  softness in the housing and real estate markets persists  consumer confidence remains less than strong and interest rates remain at historic lows 
in addition to the economic environment  the regulation and oversight of our business changed during as described in more detail in item a  risk factors  certain aspects of the reform act have had and will continue to have an impact on us  including the combination on july  of our former primary banking regulator  the ots  with the occ  the imposition of consolidated holding company capital requirements  changes to deposit insurance assessments and the roll back of federal preemption applicable to certain of our operations 
total assets decreased during the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in our loan portfolio 
however  the pace of the decline in the balance sheet and loan portfolio slowed significantly during the second half of and total assets increased slightly during the fourth quarter 
the decrease in our loan portfolio was due to decreases in our multi family  one to four family and commercial real estate mortgage loan portfolios resulting from repayments which outpaced our origination and purchase volume 
one to four family mortgage loan repayments remained at elevated levels as interest rates on thirty year fixed rate conforming mortgages  which we do not retain for portfolio  remained at historic lows and as loans in our portfolio which qualified under the expanded conforming loan limits were refinanced into fixed rate conforming mortgages 
the rise in interest rates on thirty year fixed rate mortgages at the end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter led to a decrease in loan repayments which resulted in a significantly slower pace of decline in our one to four family mortgage loan portfolio during the first two quarters of  compared to the fourth quarter 
the decrease in interest rates on thirty year fixed rate mortgages during the second and third quarters  coupled with the flattening of the us treasury yield curve during the second half of  led to an increase in mortgage loan repayments during the second half of however  the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio increased during the third quarter  which was the first increase in the portfolio in more than two years  and remained flat at december  compared to september  the decline in the multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loan portfolio was due to the absence of our lending in this market during much of during the third quarter  we resumed originations of multi family and commercial real estate loans in select locations within the new york metropolitan area 
we expect the resumption of multi family and commercial real estate lending should help to mitigate the negative impact of us government programs that impede our ability to grow the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio profitably and should result in loan portfolio and balance sheet growth in the securities portfolio decreased during the year ended december  as a result of cash flows from repayments exceeding securities purchased 
we expect to maintain our securities portfolio at  or slightly higher than  the december  level throughout total deposits decreased during the year ended december  due to decreases in certificates of deposit and liquid cds  partially offset by increases in money market  now and demand deposit and savings accounts 
during the year ended december   we continued to allow high cost certificates of deposit to run off as total assets declined 
the increases in low cost savings and now and demand deposit accounts appear to reflect customer preference for the liquidity these types of deposits provide 
the increase in money market accounts reflects the introduction of our premium money market product which we began offering during the third quarter 
we have achieved some success in extending the terms of our retained certificates of deposit 
during the year ended december   we extended million of certificates of deposit for terms of two years or more in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates 
cash flows from mortgage loan and securities repayments in excess of mortgage loan originations and purchases  securities purchases and deposit outflows enabled us to repay a portion of our matured borrowings during the year ended december   which resulted in a decrease in our borrowings portfolio from december  net income decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this decline was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income  an increase in non interest expense and a decrease in non interest income  partially offset by a decrease in provision for loan losses 
net interest income decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a decline in average interest earning assets 
as previously noted  the negative impact of the us government programs that impede our ability to grow the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio profitably and the absence of multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans during much of resulted in a significant decline in average interest earning assets 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreases in the average balances of mortgage loans and mortgage backed and other securities  coupled with decreases in the average yields on one to four family mortgage loans and mortgage backed and other securities 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreases in the average balances of borrowings and certificates of deposit  coupled with a decrease in the average cost of certificates of deposit 
the net interest margin and the net interest rate spread decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   reflecting a significant decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets  substantially offset by a decline in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities 
the allowance for loan losses decreased during the year ended december   as did the provision for loan losses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  these decreases reflect the stabilizing trend in overall asset quality experienced in and into  coupled with a reduction in the overall size of the loan portfolio over the same period 
during the year ended december   we experienced improvements in both total delinquencies and non performing loans  continuing the trend from despite the improved credit metrics of the loan portfolio  including the decline in total loan delinquencies  we felt it prudent to maintain our allowance for loan losses coverage ratio at an elevated level in the face of a still uncertain economy and high unemployment along with prolonged softness in housing values 
the allowance for loan losses at december  reflects the levels and composition of our loan delinquencies and non performing loans  our loss history  the size and composition of our loan portfolio and our evaluation of the housing and real estate markets and overall economy  including the unemployment rate 
non interest income decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreases in other non interest income  customer service fees and mortgage banking income  net  partially offset by an increase in income from boli 
the decrease in other non interest income was primarily due to a litigation settlement gain goodwill litigation and net gain on sales of non performing loans held for sale recognized during the year ended december   partially offset by an asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter 
non interest expense increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december primarily due to increases in fdic insurance premium expense  compensation and benefits expense  primarily esop related expense and pension and other postretirement benefits expense  and advertising expense  partially offset by a decrease in other non interest expense primarily as a result of a litigation settlement expense mcananey litigation recorded in the second quarter 
we continue to face several headwinds as we enter economic growth remains slow  unemployment remains elevated and home values continue to remain soft 
in addition  the implementation of operation twist by the federal reserve has contributed to a flattening of the us treasury yield curve  putting further downward pressure on long term interest rates and current mortgage loan product offerings  which will keep mortgage loan prepayments at elevated levels 
however  we are optimistic that the resumption of multi family and commercial real estate mortgage lending should facilitate modest loan and balance sheet growth in the first quarter and more robust growth during the remainder of with respect to the net interest margin  we expect savings  now and demand deposit and money market accounts will continue to increase during and that  in the current low interest rate environment  one to four family mortgage loan prepayment activity will remain elevated 
accordingly  we anticipate the net interest margin for will be relatively similar to the net interest margin for the fourth quarter
