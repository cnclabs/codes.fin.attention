overview we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions  and are dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises 
social enterprises leverage social  mobile and open technologies to place their customers and employees at the center of their business and to engage and collaborate with them in new and powerful ways 
our technologies are targeted at businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide 
we were founded in february and began offering our enterprise customer relationship management crm application service in february since then  we have augmented our crm service with new editions  services and enhanced features 
over the last few years  we have both developed and acquired several mobile  social and open technologies to help our customers become social enterprises 
we introduced our force 
com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond crm 
we launched our appexchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications and services that are integrated with our flagship crm product and in most cases have been developed on our force 
com platform by third parties 
we introduced chatter  a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real time 
recently we enabled companies to invite their customers to collaborate with chatter in private groups on this corporate social network 
our salesforce data 
com data 
com offering  which provides some contacts from jigsaw data corporation jigsaw  provides the most complete source of accurate business data and seamlessly integrates with our crm products 
we also expanded our platform offering via the acquisition of heroku  inc heroku an application development platform and the launch of database 
com  the world s first enterprise cloud database 
we acquired radian technologies  inc radian to help companies monitor and engage with their customers via social media 
our objective is to help companies put customers at the center of their businesses and transform themselves into social enterprises by leveraging our applications and platforms 
key elements of our strategy include strengthening our existing sales and service cloud applications and extending into new functional areas within the social enterprise  leading the industry transformation to the social enterprise  pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively  deepening relationships with our existing customer base  encouraging the development of third party applications on our cloud computing platforms 
we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services  the performance and security of our service  our ability to continue to release  and gain customer acceptance of  new and improved features  our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies  successful customer adoption and utilization of our service  acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers  the emergence of 
table of contents additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors  the location of new data centers  third party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms  and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services  delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates 
to address these factors  we will need to  among other things  continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions  upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition or arrangements such as a social enterprise license agreement  provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third party applications on our platforms 
our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity 
we also plan to continue to hire additional personnel  particularly in direct sales  other customer related areas and research and development 
as part of our growth plans  we intend to continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal 
additionally  we plan to expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  continue to develop our brands  add additional distribution channels  increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings  develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies  and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth 
we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses  joint ventures  services and technologies  and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings 
we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future 
as such  we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry 
during fiscal  we acquired several businesses and technologies to strengthen and extend our service offerings 
in may  we acquired radian for a total purchase consideration of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
radian is a cloud application vendor that provides customers with social media monitoring  measurement and engagement solutions 
we acquired radian for its developed technology  assembled workforce  expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating radian s social solution technology with our current product offerings 
in september  we acquired assistly for a total purchase consideration of approximately million 
assistly is a cloud based provider of customer service solutions 
we acquired assistly for its developed help desk application technology in order to expand our customer service market opportunities in the small and emerging business market 
in order to expand our mobile and social consulting services  in december  we acquired model metrics  a cloud computing professional services company  for a total purchase consideration of approximately million 
we expect marketing and sales costs  which were percent of our total revenues for fiscal and percent for the same period a year ago  to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers  and build greater brand awareness 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on january references to fiscal  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents sources of revenues we derive our revenues from subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services  support revenues from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees  professional services  which include consulting services such as process mapping and project management  and implementation services including systems integration  technical architecture and development  and data conversion  and other revenue  which consists primarily of training fees 
subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues during fiscal subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers  varying service types  the price of our service and service renewal rates 
we define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity eg  a company  a distinct business unit of a large corporation  a partnership  etc 
that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services 
we define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer authorized users  and we refer to each such user as a subscriber 
the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands 
none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal   or subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
the typical subscription and support term is to months  although terms range from one to months 
our subscription and support contracts are non cancelable  though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform 
we generally invoice our customers in advance  in annual or quarterly installments  and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue  or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in general  we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 
professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training 
our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis 
we also offer a number of training classes on implementing  using and administering our service that are billed on a per person  per class basis 
our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues  we consider a number of factors  which are described in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below 
prior to february   the deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
if the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately  the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement 
a significant portion of our multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables 
additionally  in these situations  we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu which amended the previous multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance 
pursuant to the new guidance  objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement separately 
instead  arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis 
we applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after february  which is the beginning of our fiscal year 

table of contents seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service 
over percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service 
we generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles 
there is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns 
currently  there is greater operational discipline around annual invoicing  for both new business and renewals 
occasionally  we bill customers for their multi year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue 
our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals 
the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 
accordingly  the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below in thousands april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent in thousands april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent in thousands april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent unbilled deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year  non cancelable subscription agreements 
unbilled deferred revenue was over billion as of january  and over billion as of january  unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and  accordingly  are not recorded in deferred revenue 
we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons  including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements  varying billing cycles of subscription agreements  the specific timing of customer renewals  foreign currency fluctuations  the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue  and changes in customer financial circumstances 
for multi year subscription agreements billed annually  the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period  zero just prior to renewal  and increases if the agreement is renewed 
low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer 
accordingly  we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year to year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle 
such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

table of contents cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support  the costs of data center capacity  depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software  allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies 
we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount 
employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services  including stock based expenses  the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead 
the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 
we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services 
for example  we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future 
additionally  as we acquire new businesses and technologies  the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues 
the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  in the affected periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead 
we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services  integrating acquired technologies  increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services 
our proprietary  scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application 
as a result  we do not have to maintain multiple versions  which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 
we expect that in the future  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our service offerings  develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  for our sales and marketing staff  including commissions  payments to partners  marketing programs and allocated overhead 
marketing programs consist of advertising  events  corporate communications  brand building and product marketing activities 
we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  building brand awareness  attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events 
we expect that in the future  marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  for finance and accounting  legal  internal audit  human resources and management information systems personnel  legal costs  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in the future  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs  professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion 
we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters 
stock based expenses 
our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non employee directors 
we recognize our stock based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods 
these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases  as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 

table of contents amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations 
our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts  trade names  customer lists and customer relationships 
we expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues from two sources subscription revenues  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and related professional services such as process mapping  project management  implementation services and other revenue 
other revenue consists primarily of training fees 
we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been or is being provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our subscription service arrangements are non cancelable and do not contain refund type provisions 
subscription and support revenues subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract  which is the date our service is made available to customers 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
professional services and other revenues the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis 
when these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting  as discussed below  these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts  and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts 
training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 
multiple deliverable arrangements we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include subscription  premium support  and professional services 

table of contents prior to february   the deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
if the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately  the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement 
a significant portion of our multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables 
additionally  in these situations  we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu which amended the previous multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance 
pursuant to the updated guidance  objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement separately 
instead  arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis 
we have applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after february  which is the beginning of our fiscal year 
the adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of january   the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are million and million  respectively  which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period 
under the updated accounting guidance  in order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting  the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery 
if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery  we account for each deliverable separately 
subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately 
in determining whether professional services have standalone value  we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors  the nature of the professional services  the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date  and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer s satisfaction with the professional services work 
to date  we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 
under the updated accounting guidance  when multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy 
we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  if available  or our best estimate of selling price besp  if vsoe is not available 
we have determined that third party evidence tpe is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third party pricing information 
the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue  if any 
for certain professional services  we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range 
we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency  the introduction of new services and other factors 
accordingly  we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 
we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions 
significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices  the size and volume of our transactions  the customer demographic  the geographic area where our services are sold  our price lists  our 
table of contents go to market strategy  historical standalone sales and contract prices 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management  taking into consideration the go to market strategy 
as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in relative selling prices  including both vsoe and besp 
deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year  non cancelable subscription agreements 
deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
we generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments 
deferred revenue is influenced by several factors  including seasonality  the compounding effects of renewals  invoice duration  invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter 
as a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described  billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to february  were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term 
deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 
deferred commissions 
we defer commission payments to our direct sales force 
the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers  which are typically to months 
the commission payments  which are paid in full the month after the customer s service commences  are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements 
the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non cancelable customer contracts 
we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 
during fiscal  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
during the same period a year ago  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled million at january  and million at january  business combinations 
we recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 
our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date 
we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
we reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period 
subsequent to the measurement period  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents stock based awards 
we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of generally four years or one year for the employee stock purchase plan espp 
the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated life for the stock options is based on an actual analysis of expected life 
the estimated life for the espp is based on the two purchase periods within the offering period 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a us government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights 
we estimate the future stock price volatility considering both our observed option implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations 
we believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
we recognized stock based expense of million during fiscal the requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations 
as of january   we had an aggregate of million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards 
we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of january  and assume no forfeiture activity 
we expect to continue to issue stock based awards to our employees in future periods  which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods 
we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs  as applicable by jurisdiction  when stock options are exercised 
the impact of stock based expense in the future is dependent upon  among other things  the timing of when we hire additional employees  the effect of long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees  the total number of stock awards granted  the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant  changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates 
additionally  we are required to use an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards 
this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 
as of january   there were million restricted stock awards and units outstanding 
we plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future 
the restricted stock  which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock  has an exercise price of per share  which is equal to the par value of our common stock  and vests over four years 
the fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant  and compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the tax expense or benefit for unusual items  or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates  certain non deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions  compensation  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and accounting principles 
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world 
we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority  based on the technical merits 
the tax benefit recognized is 
table of contents measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision 
strategic investments 
we report our investments in marketable equity securities at fair market value using the quoted prices in their respective active markets 
we report our investments in non marketable equity and debt securities  which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately held companies  at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
management evaluates financial results  earnings trends  technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies  as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other than temporary impairment

our effective tax rate was percent for fiscal compared to percent for the same period a year ago 
the higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and california tax credits and a tax benefit related to the may acquisition of radian the combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in foreign tax rate differential 
foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal pre tax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal pre tax income 
the combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal effective tax rate 
the lower fiscal state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items 
first  california enacted several income tax law changes  which generally benefited california based companies 
the result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate 
second  the company was subject to minimum state taxes  which reduced the state tax benefit 
the combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal state tax benefit

non gaap financial measures regulation s k item e  use of non gaap financial measures in commission filings  defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non gaap financial information 
our measures of non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit  non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share each meet the definition of a non gaap financial measure 
non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit and non gaap net income we use the non gaap measures of non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit and non gaap net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period 
we use these non gaap measures when planning  monitoring  and evaluating our performance 
we believe that these non gaap measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business  as they exclude certain expenses 
these certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period  but are made for our long term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period 
we define non gaap net income as our total net income excluding the following components  which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses 
in each case  for the reasons set forth below  we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us  in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non cash items on our gross margin and operating performance 
stock based expenses 
the company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives 
it is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention  rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period 
thus  stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
the company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts  trade names  customer lists and customer relationships  as items arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition 
while it is continually viewed for impairment  amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense  one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period 
amortization of debt discount 
under gaap  certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
accordingly  for gaap purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the company s million of convertible subordinated notes that were issued in a private placement in january the imputed interest rate is approximately  while the coupon interest rate is 
the difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense  net of the interest amount capitalized  is excluded from management s assessment of the company s operating performance because management believes that this non cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance 
management believes that the exclusion of the non cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the company s operational performance 

table of contents income tax effects 
the company s non gaap effective tax rate excludes the tax effect of the expense items described above 
we define non gaap gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues  as reported on our consolidated statement of operations  excluding the portions of stock based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles  as described above  that are included in cost of revenues 
we define non gaap operating profit as our gross profit less operating expenses  as reported on our consolidated statement of operations  excluding the portions of stock based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles  as described above  that are included in operating expenses 
non gaap earnings per share management uses the non gaap earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation 
we define non gaap earnings per share as our non gaap net income  which excludes the above components  which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses  divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding 
limitations on the use of non gaap financial measures a limitation of our non gaap financial measures of non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit  non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions 
our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies  including peer companies  and therefore comparability may be limited 
thus  our non gaap measures of non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit  non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  or in isolation from  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
additionally  in the case of stock based expense  if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock based expense  the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 
we compensate for these limitations by reconciling non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit  non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share to the most comparable gaap financial measure 
management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety  not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non gaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures

the effects of dilutive securities were not included in the gaap calculation of diluted earnings loss per share for the year ended january  because we had a net loss for the period and the effect would have been anti dilutive

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound sterling and japanese yen 
we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts 
any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures 
in accordance with our policy  the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months 
additionally  by policy  we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling billion at january  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds  time deposits  corporate notes and bonds  government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes 
our investments are made for capital preservation purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points at january  could result in a million market value reduction or increase of the same amount 
this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
at january   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling billion 
the fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in market value changes of million 
market risk and market interest risk in january  we issued at par value million of convertible senior notes due the notes 
holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  may be paid in cash or stock at our option 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants 
these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 
for the three months ended january  the notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder 
for trading days during the consecutive trading days ended january   our common stock traded did not exceed of the conversion price of per share applicable to the notes 
accordingly  the notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april  and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are not convertible 

table of contents the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of and therefore  we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes 
however  the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price 
the carrying value of our notes was million as of january  this represents the liability component of the million principal balance as of january  the total estimated fair value of our notes at january  was million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was 
we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies  many of which are in the development stage 
when our ownership interests are less than percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence  we account for investments in non marketable equity and debt securities of the privately held companies using the cost method of accounting 
otherwise  we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting 
as of january  and the fair value of these investments was million and million  respectively
