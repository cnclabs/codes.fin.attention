item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are typically exposed to a variety of market risks 
currently  these are primarily related to interest rate risk and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks 
the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which we are a party at december   and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts chosen for the following estimated sensitivity analysis are considered to be reasonable near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
however  since it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
we monitor current and forecasted interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business and seek to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
any further borrowings against the revolving credit facility or any change in the floating rate would cause a change in interest expense 
this facility contains an interest rate at either the prime rate or libor options which the prime rate was and the libor margin was at december  assuming the outstanding balance remains unchanged  a change of basis points in the prime rate would result in an increase in annual interest expense of less than million 
we have not entered into interest rate hedging arrangements in the past  and have no plans to do so 
do to fluctuating balances in the amount outstanding under this debt agreement we do not believe such arrangements to be cost effective 
the senior notes were issued to the public at par and are carried at a cost of million 
at december   these securities were typically trading at a price of approximately  indicating a market value of approximately million 
the convertible junior subordinated debentures  payable to the trust  pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
the estimated fair value of these securities is estimated to be approximately million at december   based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 
increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these debt instruments to decrease but such changes will not affect our interest costs 
the remainder of the our long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  nor otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease 
securities subject to market risk consist of investments held by our preneed funeral  cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care trust funds 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the estimated fair values of those securities 
the sensitivity of the fixed income securities is such that a change in interest rates causes an approximate change in the value of the fixed income securities
