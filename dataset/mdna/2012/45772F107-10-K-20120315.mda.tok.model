the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a fabless provider of high speed analog semiconductor solutions for the communications and computing markets 
our analog semiconductor solutions provide high signal integrity at leading edge data speeds while reducing system power consumption 
our semiconductor solutions are designed to address bandwidth bottlenecks in networks  maximize throughput and minimize latency in computing environments and enable the rollout of next generation communications and computing infrastructures 
our solutions provide a vital high speed interface between analog signals and digital information in high performance systems such as telecommunications transport systems  enterprise networking equipment  datacenter and enterprise servers  storage platforms  test and measurement equipment and military systems 
we provide g and g high speed analog semiconductor solutions for the communications market and high speed memory interface solutions for the computing market 
we have a broad product portfolio with product lines and over products as of december  we have ongoing  informal collaborative discussions with industry and technology leaders such as amd  alcatel lucent  huawei and intel to design architectures and products that solve bandwidth bottlenecks in existing and next generation communications and computing systems 
although we do not have any formal agreements with these entities  we engage in informal discussions with these entities with respect to anticipated technological challenges  next generation customer requirements and industry conventions and standards 
we help define industry conventions and standards within the markets we target by collaborating with technology leaders  oems  systems manufacturers and standards bodies 

table of contents the history of our product development and sales and marketing efforts is as follows from to  we were primarily engaged in the development of our core high speed analog products and proprietary system architecture models to address bottlenecks in emerging network architectures 
specifically  during this period  we developed and shipped our ghz mux and demux products 
during this period  we also began development work on our initial g products 
in  we introduced and shipped g  g and g logic products  g mux and g transimpedance amplifiers and modulator drivers for the communications  test and measurement and military markets 
during this period  we also began the development of our first generation high speed plls and register solution used primarily in conjunction with double data rate  or ddr  modules for the computing market 
in  we introduced and shipped our high speed plls and register solution used primarily in conjunction with ddr modules for the computing market 
in  we began development of our second generation single chip high speed plls and register solution to be used primarily in conjunction with double data rate  or ddr  modules for the computing market and were the first to introduce this product to the market 
in addition  we introduced and shipped track and hold amplifiers for the communications market 
in  we began volume shipments of our high speed plls and register solution used primarily in conjunction with ddr modules  and continued development of our single chip high speed plls and register solution  used primarily in conjunction with ddr modules 
in  we began volume shipments of our g drivers for the communications market and commenced shipments of our high speed plls and register solution used primarily in conjunction with ddr modules for the computing market 
in  due to the launch of intel s nehalem based platform servers  we began volume shipments of our single chip high speed plls and register solution to be used primarily in conjunction with ddr modules 
we also shipped engineering samples of the first generation of our isolation memory buffer  or imb  for the computing market 
we also began development of our second generation imb product  the architecture for which has been adopted by the joint electronic device engineering council  or jedec  and development of our low power cmos serdes product for next generation g ethernet in enterprise networks 
in  we began to ship in production volume a low voltage version of our integrated pll and register buffer 
we also shipped engineering samples of the second generation imb product 
in  we began to ship in production volume a new ultra low voltage version of our integrated pll and register buffer and the second generation of imb 
we also shipped engineering samples of our cdr and serdes products 
our products are designed into systems sold by oems  including agilent  alcatel lucent  cisco  danaher  dell  emc  hp  huawei  ibm and oracle 
we believe we are one of a limited number of suppliers to these oems  and in some cases we may be the sole supplier for certain applications 
we sell both directly to these oems and to module manufacturers  original design manufacturers  or odms  and subsystems providers that  in turn  sell to these oems 
during the year ended december   we sold our products to more than customers 
a significant portion of our revenue has been generated by a limited number of customers 
sales directly to samsung accounted for and of our total revenue and sales directly and through distributors to micron accounted for and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  sales directly to hynix accounted for of our total revenue for the year ended december  substantially all of our sales to date  including our sales to samsung  micron and hynix  are made on a purchase order basis 
since the beginning of  we have shipped more than million high speed analog semiconductors 
our total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 

table of contents sales to customers in asia accounted for   and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
because many of our customers or their oem manufacturers are located in asia  we anticipate that a majority of our future revenue will continue to come from sales to that region 
although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in asia  we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers are then sold to end users outside asia 
in april  we received approval from the government of singapore to set up an international headquarters from which to conduct our international operations 
because of its geographic alignment with suppliers and customers  we established our operations in singapore to become a new international headquarters office for receiving and fulfilling orders for product shipped to locations outside the united states 
singapore has a strong university system and an established group of technology based companies from which to recruit new engineers 
we intend to build a team of engineering capability in singapore both for development as well as testing associated with manufacturing 
international operations in singapore commenced on may  and during  we transitioned our international operations from the united states to our singapore subsidiary 
demand for new features changes rapidly 
it is difficult for us to forecast the demand for our products  in part because of the complex supply chain between us and the end user markets that incorporate our products 
due to our lengthy product development cycle  it is critical for us to anticipate changes in demand for our various product features and the applications they serve to allow sufficient time for product development and design 
our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our customer relationships 
conversely  our failure to forecast declining demand or shifts in product mix can result in excess or obsolete inventory 
although revenue generated by each design win and the timing of the recognition of that revenue can vary significantly  we consider ongoing design wins to be a key factor in our future success 
we consider a design win to occur when an oem or contract manufacturer notifies us that it has selected our products to be incorporated into a product or system under development 
the design win process is typically lengthy  and as a result  our sales cycles will vary based on the market served  whether the design win is with an existing or new customer and whether our product is under consideration for inclusion in a first or subsequent generation product 
in addition  our customers products that incorporate our semiconductors can be complex and can require a substantial amount of time to define  design and produce in volume 
as a result  we can incur significant design and development expenditures in circumstances where we do not ultimately recognize  or experience delays in recognizing revenue 
our customers generally order our products on a purchase order basis 
we do not have any long term purchase commitments in excess of one year from any of our customers 
once our product is incorporated into a customer s design  however  we believe that our product is likely to continue to be purchased for that design throughout that product s life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative semiconductor 
our design cycle from initial engagement to volume shipment is typically two to three years 
product life cycles in the markets we serve typically range from two to years or more and vary by application 
summary of consolidated financial results as discussed in more detail below  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we delivered the following financial performance total revenues decreased by million  or  to million 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to from total operating expenses increased by million  or  to million 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million 
diluted earnings per share decreased by  or  to 

table of contents in  we decided to discontinue the sale of legacy products supported by our taiwan subsidiary and transitioned the taiwan subsidiary to be a design and sales support center 
the restructuring expense associated with the change in the taiwan structure was million  of which million pertains to write off of certain intangibles 
the decrease in our revenue for the year ended december  was a result of a decrease in consumption of our high speed memory interface products as customers depleted their own inventories rather than purchasing new parts and a temporary slowdown as customers transition to the new technology platform 
our income from operations decreased due to lower gross profit and increased operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in headcount and stock based compensation  as well as the restructuring charges related to the taiwan subsidiary 
our expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  which include compensation  benefits  payroll related taxes and stock based compensation 
the acquisition of winyatek technology inc on june  increased our headcount by in addition  in we also hired new employees  primarily in the engineering department 
we expect expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest resources to develop more products  to support the growth of our business and the cost associated with being a public company including  compliance with sarbanes oxley act of our diluted earnings per share decreased primarily due to reduction in revenues combined with increases in operating expenses  reversal of deferred tax assets valuation allowance of million during the year ended december   new issuance of common stock as a result of initial public offering in november and due to preferred stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as they were antidilutive 
shares of our preferred stock were converted into common stock in november upon completion of our initial public offering 
critical accounting policies and significant management estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
revenue recognition our products are fully functional at the time of shipment and do not require production  modification or customization 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our fee is considered fixed or determinable at the execution of an agreement  based on specific products and quantities to be delivered at specified prices  which is evidenced by a customer purchase order or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
our agreements with non distributor customers do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment of product to end customers 

table of contents approximately of our sales were made through third party distributors in sales to distributors are included in deferred revenue and we include the related costs in inventory until sales and delivery to the end customers occurs 
two distributor arrangements  which together accounted for of our total revenue in  allow for limited price protection and rights of stock rotation on product unsold by the distributors 
the price protection rights allow distributors the right to a credit in the event of declines in the price of our product that they hold prior to the sale to a specific end customer 
in the event that we reduce the selling price of products held by distributors  deferred revenue related to distributors with price protection rights is reduced upon notification to the customer of the price change 
stock rotation in the two distributor arrangements is limited to returns for exchange only for a small percentage of product purchased over a limited period of time during the immediately prior three to nine months 
other than these two arrangements  no other customer arrangements include any rights of return or acceptance provisions 
there were no material product returns or price protection credits in  and revenue recognition on product sales through distributors is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data prior to the release of our consolidated financial statements regarding the product  price  quantity and end customer when products are resold  as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we have not experienced any significant sales returns from end customers due to our stringent quality control standards 
we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging 
our policy is to record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific collection issues we have identified  aging of underlying receivables and historical experience of uncollectible balances 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to record the allowance for doubtful accounts during the past three years 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  for example  if the financial condition of the customer deteriorated  we may be required to record additional expense that could materially negatively impact our operating results 
to date  however  substantially all of our receivables have been collected within the credit term of to days 
inventory valuation we value our inventory  which includes materials  labor and overhead  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically write down our inventory to the lower of cost or market based on our estimates that consider historical usage and future demand 
these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions  technology changes  new product introductions and changes in strategic direction 
the calculation of our inventory valuation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and technological obsolescence that may turn out to be inaccurate 
inventory valuation reserves were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
inventory valuation reserves  once established  are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to record inventory reserves during the past three years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our inventory reserve 
however  if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
product warranty our products are under warranty against defects in material and workmanship generally for a period of one or two years 
we accrue for estimated warranty cost at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience including knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of 
table of contents our typical experience 
the warranty obligation is determined based on product failure rates  cost of replacement and failure analysis cost 
we monitor product returns for warranty related matters and monitor an accrual for the related warranty expense based on historical experience 
our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding failure rates and failure analysis costs 
if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates  adjustments may be required in the future  which would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
the warranty liability as of december   and  were  and  and  respectively 
in september  we were informed of a claim related to repair and replacement costs in connection with shipments of over  integrated circuits made by us during the summer and fall of of these shipments  approximately were later confirmed or suspected to have random manufacturing process anomalies in the wafer die in the product 
these anomalies made the circuitry of a small number of random die per foundry wafer susceptible to failure under certain customer specific system operating conditions 
at the time of shipment in and early  we established an initial warranty reserve and added to that accrual as the problem was identified and reliable information became available 
the foundry who produced the wafers has informed us that the random anomalies are normal in a gallium arsenide  or gaas  manufacturing process 
we are currently investigating whether these anomalies were normal  or whether they could have been the result of a foundry manufacturing process that was not sufficiently robust to reliably produce a part that could deliver the specified performance 
in march  we developed additional tests to screen out the wafer die that might be susceptible to this type of failure and resumed shipments to the customer with no subsequent additional reported incidents 
based on our standard warranty provisions  we have provided replacement parts to the customer for the known and suspected failures that had occurred 
in addition and without informing us  in the fall of the customer instituted its own larger scale replacement program that covered the replacement of entire subassemblies in which our product was only one component 
in september  the customer made an initial claim for approximately million against us for the costs incurred relative to that program 
in june  the customer sent us an e mail and reduced their initial claim down to million 
we believe the amount of the claim is without merit as our warranty liability is contractually limited to the repair or replacement of our affected products  which to the extent the customer has requested replacement  has already been completed 
a formal claim has yet to be made and discussions with the customer are ongoing 
at this time  we believe our current warranty reserves are adequate to address the matter and that our obligations under our standard warranty provisions have been fulfilled 
however  claims of this nature are subject to various risks and uncertainties and there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved without further significant costs to us  including the potential for arbitration or litigation and adverse customer relations 
if and when the amount of any additional loss  if any  becomes both probable and determinable  we may be required to record an incremental reserve 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets 
events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
since we only have one reporting unit  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by taking our market capitalization as 
table of contents determined through quoted market prices and adjusted for control premiums and other relevant factors 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill and the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  impairment exists and is recorded 
in the event that we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired  we will record an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made 
we have not been required to perform this second step of the process because the fair value of the reporting unit has significantly exceeded its book value at every measurement date 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date fair values of the awards 
the fair value is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
we elected to treat share based payment awards with graded vesting schedules and time based service conditions as a single award and recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period 
stock based compensation expenses are classified in the statement of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports 
we account for stock options issued to non employees in accordance with the guidance for equity based payments to non employees 
stock option awards to non employees are accounted for at fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
our management believes that the fair value of stock options is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received 
the fair value of the unvested portion of the options granted to non employees is re measured each period 
the resulting increase in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
the black scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in determining the fair value of our awards 
the most significant assumptions and judgments include estimating the fair value of underlying stock  expected volatility and expected term 
in addition  the recognition of stock based compensation expense is impacted by estimated forfeiture rates 
we estimated the expected volatility from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the semiconductor industry because our common stock has limited trading history 
when selecting the public companies used in the volatility calculation  we selected companies in the semiconductor industry with comparable characteristics to us  including stage of development  lines of business  market capitalization  revenue and financial leverage 
the weighted average expected life of options was calculated using the simplified method 
this decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited experience and the lack of active market for our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding to the expected term of the options 
the expected dividend rate is zero based on the fact that we have not historically paid dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the forfeiture rate is established based on the historical average period of time that options were outstanding and adjusted for expected changes in future exercise patterns 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be material changes in the estimates and assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
in the future  if we determine that other option valuation models are more reasonable  the stock based compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded using the black scholes option pricing model 

table of contents income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when and where the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered historical levels of income  projections of future income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
although  we believe that the judgment we used is reasonable  actual results can differ due to a change in market conditions  changes in tax laws and other factors 
from inception through  we incurred annual losses  and accordingly  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets 
we considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance and evaluated the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis 
the determination of recording or releasing a tax valuation allowance is made  in part  pursuant to an assessment performed by management regarding the likelihood that we will generate sufficient future taxable income against which the benefits of our deferred tax assets may or may not be realized 
this assessment requires management to exercise significant judgment and make estimates with respect to our ability to generate revenue  gross profits  operating income and taxable income in future periods 
among other factors  management must make assumptions regarding current and projected overall business and semiconductor industry conditions  operating efficiencies  our ability to timely develop  introduce and consistently manufacture new products to meet our customers needs and specifications  our ability to adapt to technological changes and the competitive environment  which may impact our ability to generate taxable income and  in turn  realize the value of our deferred tax assets 
significant cumulative operating losses in and prior years  uncertainty with respect to the acceptance of our products by end customers and significant economic uncertainties in the market made our ability to project future taxable income highly uncertain and volatile at december  although was our first profitable year  only the last three quarters of the year were profitable and the vast majority of our pre tax income was generated in the last two quarters of the year 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including a relatively short period of recent profitability coupled with significant uncertainties associated with our business outlook  we concluded  as of december   that it was not more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets would be realized 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  we received our first substantial quantity of production orders for a low voltage product  product number insstelv gs  or the gs product  which was a new low voltage version of our integrated pll and register buffer 
this gs product has been launched and in full commercial production and is shipping in commercial volume 
the arrival of these production orders from one of our largest customers reduced concerns and increased our confidence in the strength of our business outlook for the balance of in addition  certain other new product introductions began to gain traction with customers  providing additional confidence in our longer term outlook 
we also achieved further clarity around certain contingencies related to ongoing litigation and certain other product acceptance concerns that existed at december  furthermore  during the first quarter of  we unexpectedly received additional orders for an older product that allowed us to exceed the overall plan for the quarter and continue our recent trend of profitability into the first quarter of at its april  meeting  based on a review of the positive developments that materialized in the first quarter of  our board of directors decided to authorize management to retain investment bankers and proceed with plans to pursue a potential initial public offering 
based on these positive developments and an additional quarter of profitable operation  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance at march  and concluded that a change in circumstances had occurred 
management determined that  based on our prospects and business outlook  it was then reasonable to conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  we released the full valuation allowance recorded against our deferred 
table of contents tax assets based on the weight of positive evidence that existed at march  significant judgment is required to determine the timing and extent of a valuation allowance release and our ability to utilize deferred tax assets will continue to be dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods 
based on our current trend of operating results and forecasts  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will recognize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and no valuation allowance is required as of december  and  except for the deferred tax assets of our taiwan subsidiary for which a full valuation allowance of was provided at december  in accordance with fasbs guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we perform a comprehensive review of uncertain tax positions regularly 
the guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return 
we determine the tax liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not based on technical merits that each income tax position would be sustained upon examination 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the assessment of each tax position requires significant judgment and estimates 
we believe our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities could challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
all tax positions are periodically analyzed and adjusted as a result of events  such as the resolution of tax audits  issuance of new regulations or new case law  negotiations with tax authorities  and expiration of statutes of limitations 
results of operations and key operating metrics the following describes the line items in the statements of operations  which we consider to be our key operating metrics 
revenue 
we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to end customers 
a portion of our products is sold indirectly to customers through distributors 
we design and develop high speed analog semiconductor solutions for the communications and computing markets 
our revenue is driven by various trends in these markets 
these trends include the deployment and broader market adoption of next generation g and g technologies in communications and enterprise networks  the timing of next generation network and enterprise server upgrades in different geographic locations worldwide  the introduction and broader market adoption of next generation server platforms such as intel s nehalem based platform  and the deployment of high speed memory interfaces in server and computing platforms 
our revenue is also impacted by changes in the number and average selling prices of our semiconductor products 
our products are typically characterized by a life cycle that begins with higher average selling prices and lower volumes  followed by broader market adoption  higher volumes  and average selling prices that are lower than initial levels 
we operate in industries characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards as well as technological obsolescence 
our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to continually develop and introduce new products to meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers  diversify our revenue base and generate new revenue to replace  or build upon  the success of previously introduced products which may be rapidly maturing 
as a result  our revenue is impacted to a more significant extent by product life cycles for a variety of products and to a much lesser extent  if any  by any single product 
in  we successfully introduced and began to ship a new product in production which integrated a new pll  along with a new register buffer 
sales of this newly introduced part comprised and of our total revenue in and  respectively 
in  this product matured 
as a result  sales of this product in declined in volume 
in 
table of contents  we also began to ship in production volume a new low voltage version of our integrated pll and register buffer  which is shipping in the form of product number insstelv gs  or the gs product 
sales of the gs product comprised and of our total revenue in and  respectively 
in  we began to ship in production volume a new ultra low voltage version of our integrated pll and register buffer  which is shipping in the form of product number inssteuv gs  or the gsuv product 
sales of the gsuv product comprised of our total revenue in in  we expect that revenue from sales of gs and gsuv will continue to be significant 
the following table is based on the geographic location to which our product is initially shipped 
in most cases this will differ from the ultimate location of the end user of a product containing our technology 
for sales to our distributors  their geographic location may be different from the geographic locations of the ultimate end customer

as some semiconductor products mature and unit volumes increase  their average selling prices may decline 
these declines are often paired with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer  assembly and test costs  which offset some of the margin reduction that results from lower prices 
however  our gross profit  period over period  may fluctuate as a result of changes in average selling prices due to new product introductions or existing product transitions into larger scale commercial volumes  manufacturing costs as well as our product mix

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million 
our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses  purchase inventory and acquire property and equipment 
cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses  as reflected in the changes in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our primary sources of cash are cash receipts on accounts receivable from our revenue 
aside from the growth in amounts billed to our customers  net cash collections of accounts receivable are impacted by the efficiency of our cash collections process  which can vary from period to period  depending on the payment cycles of our major customers

operating and capital expenditure requirements our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities from operations will be sufficient to finance our operational cash needs through at least the next to months 
in the future  we expect our operating and capital expenditures to increase as we increase headcount  expand our business activities and grow our end customer base which will result in higher needs for working capital 
our ability to generate cash from operations is also subject to substantial risks described in part i  item a  risk factors 
if any of these risks 
table of contents occur  we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities 
we would then be required to use existing cash and cash equivalents to support our working capital and other cash requirements 
if additional funds are required to support our working capital requirements  acquisitions or other purposes  we may seek to raise funds through debt financing or from other sources 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties  the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operating flexibility  and would also require us to incur interest expense 
we can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations as of december   we had noncancelable purchase obligations consisting primarily of license and consulting fees the company committed to pay under several agreements of million  which are payable in as of december   we recorded a liability for our uncertain tax position of million 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
we depend upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our wafers 
our subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders  but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation 
as of december   the total value of open purchase orders for wafers was approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements since our inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  such as the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
recent authoritative accounting guidance see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million and million at december  and december   respectively  which was held for working capital purposes 
our exposure to market interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments 
we manage our total portfolio to encompass a diversified pool of investment grade securities to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
we place our investments with high quality issuers  money market funds and debt securities 
our investment portfolio as of december  consisted of money market funds  us treasuries  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  variable rate demand notes and asset backed securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses  net of applicable taxes  included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
although  we currently expect that our ability to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities will continue  we cannot ensure that this will not change 
we believe that  if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the impact on the fair value of these securities or our cash flows or income would not be material 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  the current interest rate environment may negatively impact our investment income 
our cash and cash equivalents and investment in marketable securities at december  consisted of million held domestically  with the remaining balance of million held by foreign subsidiaries 
there may be adverse tax effects upon repatriation of these funds to the united states 
we do not plan to repatriate cash balances from foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations in the united states 
foreign currency risk to date  our international customer and vendor agreements have been denominated almost exclusively in united states dollars 
accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not currently enter into foreign currency hedging transactions
