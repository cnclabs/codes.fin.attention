in addition  the company owns a interest in ponderay newsprint company ponderay  a general partnership  which owns and operates a newsprint mill in the state of washington 
the company is required to purchase up to  metric tons of newsprint annually from ponderay on a take if tendered basis at prevailing market prices 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for a majority of its investments in unconsolidated companies 
raw materials during fiscal  the company consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint compared to  metric tons in fiscal for its continuing operations 
the decrease in tons consumed was primarily due to lower advertising sales and circulation volumes 
the company currently obtains a majority of its supply of newsprint from ponderay and sp newsprint co 
sp  as well as a number of other suppliers  primarily under long term contracts 
in addition to the commitment for ponderay newsprint noted above  the company has a purchase commitment for of  metric tons of newsprint from sp 
the company s earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
newsprint expense accounted for of total operating expenses in fiscal and in fiscal however  because the company has an ownership interest in ponderay  an increase in newsprint prices  while negatively affecting the company s operating expenses  would increase the earnings from its share of this investment  therefore partially offsetting the increase in the company s newsprint expense 
a decline in newsprint prices would have the opposite effect 
ponderay is also impacted by fluctuations in the cost of energy and fiber used in the paper making process 
the company estimates that it will use approximately  metric tons of newsprint in fiscal  depending on the level of print advertising  circulation volumes and other business considerations 
the company purchased  metric tons of newsprint from ponderay and sp in see the discussion above  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the financial statements and accompanying notes for further discussion of the impact of these investments on the company s business

competition the company s newspapers  direct marketing programs and internet sites compete for advertising revenues and readers time with television  radio  other internet sites  direct mail companies  free shoppers  suburban neighborhood and national newspapers and other publications  and billboard companies  among others 
in some of its markets  the company s newspapers also compete with other newspapers published in nearby cities and 
table of contents towns 
competition for advertising is generally based upon print readership levels and demographics  advertising rates  internet usage and advertiser results  while competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon the content  journalistic quality  service and the price of the newspaper 
the company s major daily newspapers are the primary general circulation newspaper in each of their respective markets 
its newspaper internet sites are generally the leading local sites in each of the company s major daily newspaper markets  based upon research conducted by the company and various independent sources 
nonetheless  the company has noted changes in readership trends  including a shift of readers to the internet and mobile devices  and has experienced a continued shift of advertising to digital advertising 
the company faces greater competition  particularly in the areas of employment  automotive and real estate advertising  from online competitors 
to address the structural shift to digital media  the company s newspapers provide editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats from its daily newspaper to leading local websites  on social network sites such as facebook and twitter  on smartphones and on e readers  on blogs and in niche publications and websites  in e mail newsletters and rss feeds 
in addition  its websites offer leading digital classified products such as careerbuilder

the company also operates dealsaver its proprietary daily deals service  in all of its markets 
employees labor as of december   the company had approximately  full and part time employees equating to approximately  full time equivalent employees  of whom approximately were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements with expiration dates through twenty one of the company s daily papers have no unions 
while the company s newspapers have not had a strike for decades and the company does not currently anticipate a strike occurring  the company cannot preclude the possibility that a strike may occur at one or more of its newspapers when future negotiations occur 
the company believes that  in the event of a newspaper strike  it would be able to continue to publish and deliver to subscribers  a capability which is critical to retaining revenues from advertising and circulation  although there can be no assurance of this 
compliance with environmental laws the company uses appropriate waste disposal techniques for items such as ink and other toxic fluids 
the company has million of letters of credit shared among various state environmental agencies and the us environmental protection agency to provide collateral related to existing or previously disposed oil drums 
however  the company does not currently have any significant environmental issues and has no significant expenses or capital expenditures related to environmental control facilities 
item a 
risk factors the company has significant competition in the market for news and advertising  which may reduce its advertising and circulation revenues in the future 
the company s primary source of revenues is advertising  followed by circulation 
in recent years  the advertising industry generally has experienced a secular shift toward internet advertising and away from other traditional media 
in addition  the company s circulation has declined  reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry  including consumer migration toward the internet and other media for news and information 
the company faces increasing competition from other digital sources for both advertising and circulation revenues 
this competition has intensified as a result of the continued developments of digital media technologies 
distribution of news  entertainment and other information over the internet  as well as through mobile phones  tablets and other devices  continues to increase in popularity 
these technological developments are increasing the number of media choices available to advertisers and audiences 
as media audiences fragment  the company 
table of contents expects advertisers to continue to allocate larger portions of their advertising budgets to digital media 
this increased competition has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results  including negatively impacting revenues and operating income 
weak general economic and business conditions subject the company to risks of declines in advertising revenues 
despite some signs of recovery  the u 
s 
economy continues to be in a period of economic uncertainty 
certain aspects of the economy  including real estate  employment and consumer confidence  remain challenging 
these economic conditions have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the company s advertising revenues 
to the extent these economic conditions continue or worsen  the company s business and advertising revenues will be adversely affected  which could negatively impact the company s operations and cash flows and the company s ability to meet the covenants in its senior secured credit agreement 
in addition  seasonal variations in consumer spending cause our quarterly advertising revenues to fluctuate 
second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are typically higher than first and third quarter advertising revenues  reflecting the slower economic activity in the winter and summer and the stronger fourth quarter holiday season 
if general economic conditions and other factors cause a decline in revenues  particularly during the second or fourth quarters  the company may not be able to grow or maintain its revenues for the year  which would have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future 
as a result  you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance 
our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors  many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control  including the timing of our investments  restructuring plans and capital expenditures  expenses associated with our long term plans  including our construction of and relocation to a new production facility and offices in miami  our ability to implement cost controls  and the effect of the overall economy on our revenues  particularly advertising revenues related to employment  real estate and consumer goods 
if management is unable to execute cost control measures successfully  total operating costs may be greater than expected  which may adversely affect the company s profitability 
as a result of recent adverse general economic and business conditions and the company s operating results  the company has taken steps to lower operating costs by reducing workforce and implementing general cost control measures 
if the company does not achieve its expected savings from these initiatives  or if operating costs increase as a result of these initiatives  total operating costs may be greater than anticipated 
although management believes that appropriate steps have been taken and are being taken to implement cost control efforts  such efforts may affect the company s business and its ability to generate future revenue 
portions of the company s expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues 
as a result  management is limited in its ability to reduce costs in the short term 
if these cost control efforts do not reduce costs sufficiently  income from continuing operations may decline 
an economic downturn and its impact on the company s business may result in goodwill and masthead impairment charges 
the company recorded masthead impairment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and billion of goodwill and masthead impairment charges in fiscal reflecting the economic 
table of contents downturn and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded common stock 
further erosion of general economic  market or business conditions could have a negative impact on the company s business and stock price  which may require the company to record additional impairment charges in the future 
the company has billion in total consolidated debt  which subjects the company to significant financial risk 
as of december   the company had approximately billion in total principal indebtedness outstanding 
this level of debt increases the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
higher leverage ratios could affect the company s future ability to refinance maturing debt or the ultimate structure of such refinancing 
in addition  the company s credit ratings could affect its ability to refinance its debt 
covenants in the indenture governing the company s senior secured notes due the notes and its senior secured credit facility restrict the company s operations in many ways 
the indenture governing the notes and the senior secured credit facility contain various covenants that limit  subject to certain exceptions  the company s ability and or its restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur liens or additional debt or provide guarantees  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock or repurchase capital stock or repurchase outstanding notes or debentures prior to their stated maturity  make loans  investments or acquisitions  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from its subsidiaries  create or permit restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions or guarantee debt or create liens  sell assets and capital stock of its subsidiaries  enter into certain transactions with its affiliates  and dissolve  liquidate  consolidate or merge with or into  or sell substantially all its assets to another person 
the restrictions contained in the indenture for the notes and the senior secured credit facility could adversely affect the company s ability to finance its operations  make needed capital expenditures  make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances  withstand a future downturn in its business or the economy in general  engage in business activities  including future opportunities  that may be in its interest  and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute its business strategies 
the company s ability to comply with covenants contained in the indenture for the notes and the senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond its control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
even if the company is able to comply with all of the applicable covenants  the restrictions on its ability to manage its business could adversely affect its business by  among other things  limiting its ability to take advantage of financings  mergers  acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that the company believes would be beneficial to it 

table of contents potential disruptions in the credit markets could adversely affect the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and could adversely affect the company s access to capital or to obtain financing at reasonable rates and its ability to refinance existing debt at reasonable rates or at all 
if internal funds are insufficient to fund the company s operations  the company may be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet its financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as were experienced during and  could adversely affect the company s ability to access additional funds in the capital markets or draw on its senior secured credit facility 
there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair the company s liquidity in future periods 
if this should happen  any alternative credit arrangements may not be put in place without a potentially significant increase in the company s cost of borrowing 
as of december   the company had approximately billion in total principal indebtedness  consisting of million of publicly traded senior secured notes and unsecured publicly traded notes maturing in   and the near term notes totaled million 
while cash flow should permit the company to lower the amount of this debt before it matures  a significant portion of this debt will probably need to be refinanced in the future 
access to the capital markets for longer term financing may be restricted if disruptions in the capital and credit markets occur again as were experienced during and the company requires newsprint for operations and  therefore  its operating results may be adversely affected if the price of newsprint increases 
newsprint is the major component of the company s cost of raw materials 
newsprint accounted for of mcclatchy s operating expenses for fiscal accordingly  earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and may increase as a result of various factors  including declining newsprint supply from mill closures  reduction in newsprint suppliers because of consolidation in the newsprint industry  paper mills reducing their newsprint supply because of switching their production to other paper grades  and a decline in the financial situation of newsprint suppliers 
the company has not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint 
if the price of newsprint increases materially  operating results could be adversely affected 
if newsprint suppliers experience labor unrest  transportation difficulties or other supply disruptions  the company s ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired and or the cost of the newsprint could increase  both of which would negatively affect its operating results 
a portion of the company s employees are members of unions and if the company experiences labor unrest  its ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired 
if mcclatchy experiences labor unrest  its ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired in some locations 
the results of future labor negotiations could harm the company s operating results 
the company s newspapers have not endured a labor strike for decades 
however  management cannot ensure that a strike will not occur at one or more of the company s newspapers in the future 
as of december   approximately of full time and part time employees were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements  with expiration dates through mcclatchy faces collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements 
even if its newspapers do not suffer a labor strike  the company s operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict its ability to maximize the efficiency of its newspaper operations 

table of contents under the pension protection act  the company will be required to make greater contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the next several years than previously required  placing greater liquidity needs upon its operations 
the adverse conditions in the capital markets in had a significantly negative impact on the investment funds in the company s pension plan  which was partially offset by strong returns in the capital markets since the end of in may  the company contributed million in cash to the pension plan and in january  mcclatchy contributed company owned real property valued at million to its pension plan 
however  even with these contributions plan assets fell short of its projected benefit obligations 
as a result  the projected benefit obligations of the qualified pension plan exceeded plan assets by million as of december  in early  the company contributed million to its qualified defined benefit pension plan  reducing the underfunded obligation from million at year end to million as of january   all other things being equal 
the excess of benefit obligations over pension assets is expected to give rise to required pension contributions over the next several years 
the pension relief act of pra provided relief in the funding requirements of the qualified defined benefit pension plan  and the company has elected an option that allows the funding related to its and plan years required contributions to be paid over years 
however  even with the relief provided by the pra  management expects future contributions to be required 
in addition  poor capital market performance and or lower long term interest rates may result in greater annual contribution requirements 
the company has invested in certain internet ventures  but such ventures may not be as successful as expected  which could adversely affect the results of operations of the company 
the company continues to evaluate its business and make strategic investments in digital ventures  either alone or with partners  to further its growth in its digital businesses 
in  mcclatchy became a owner of shopco  llc  a partnership with several other leading media and publishing companies  which provides its find n save shopping portal with significant scale 
the company also has investments in careerbuilder 
com  cars 
com  apartments 
com and homefinder 
com 
there can be no assurances that the company will receive a return on these investments or partnerships will result in advertising growth or will produce equity income or capital gains in future years 
if the company is not successful in growing its digital businesses  its business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 
the company s future growth depends to a significant degree upon the development of its digital businesses 
the growth and success of its digital businesses over the long term depend on various factors  including  among other things  the ability to continue to increase digital audiences  attract advertisers to its websites  maintain or increase the advertising rates on its websites  exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish its products and services from those of competitors and develop new content  products and services  and invest funds and resources in digital opportunities 
if the company is not successful in growing its digital businesses  its business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 

table of contents circulation declines could adversely affect the company s circulation and advertising revenues 
advertising and circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels of the company s newspapers 
in recent years  newspapers have experienced difficulty maintaining or increasing print circulation levels because of a number of factors  including increased competition from other publications and other forms of media technologies available in various markets  including the internet and other new media formats that are often free for users  continued fragmentation of media audiences  a growing preference among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper  increases in subscription and newsstand rates  and declining discretionary spending by consumers affected by negative economic conditions 
these factors could also affect the company s newspapers ability to institute circulation price increases for print products 
a prolonged reduction in circulation would have a material adverse effect on advertising revenues 
to maintain the company s circulation base  it may be required to incur additional costs that it may not be able to recover through circulation and advertising revenues 
adverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact the company s business practices and operating results 
from time to time  the company and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation and regulatory  environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies 
adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect the company s operating results or financial condition as well as its ability to conduct businesses as they are presently being conducted

see the following results of operations for a discussion of the company s revenue performance and contribution by category for fiscal  and recent events and trends advertising revenues advertising revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal decreased as a result of the continuing weak economy and the secular shift in advertising demand from print to digital products 
while advertising revenue trends generally improved throughout  they slowed in the first nine months of in particular  beginning in december  the company noted a marked decline in national advertising that persisted throughout however  retail and national advertising began to improve in september and continued to trend better through the fourth quarter of 
table of contents management believes the advertising declines over the last several years are primarily attributable to the weaknesses in the us economy and the choppiness of the general economic recovery  along with the general shift in advertising to digital media

the company is leasing back the property from its pension plan for years at an initial annual rent of approximately million 
the property is managed by an independent fiduciary and the appraisals and lease payments were determined by that fiduciary 
the contribution of real property satisfied virtually all of the company s required pension contribution in cash contributions as discussed below  on may   the company made a voluntary contribution of million to its qualified defined benefit plan from proceeds of the sale of real property in miami 
also in january  the company contributed million to its qualified defined benefit pension plan  which is expected to fully fund its required contributions in fiscal sale of real property in miami and subsequent plans for relocation sale transaction on may   the company sold acres of land in miami  including the building holding the operations of one of its subsidiaries  the miami herald media company  and an adjacent parking lot for a purchase price of million 
approximately acres of the miami land was previously subject to a contract with another buyer that terminated in the first quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a greater discussion of the original contract 
the company received cash proceeds of million  and an additional million is being held in an escrow account payable to mcclatchy upon relocation of its miami operations 
the miami herald media company will continue to operate from its existing location through may rent free 
because the company will not pay rent for the two year period  the company is deemed to have continuing involvement in the property 
as a result  under generally accepted accounting principles  the sale is treated as a financing transaction 
accordingly  the company will continue to depreciate the carrying value of the building in its financial statements and no gain or loss has been recognized on the transaction until its operations are moved 
the company used million of the sale proceeds to make a contribution to its qualified defined benefit pension plan and used the remaining portion of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the payment of interest and taxes and for debt reduction 

table of contents relocation plans on january   the company entered into a contract to purchase approximately acres of land located in doral  fla  for approximately million 
mcclatchy intends to build a new production facility on this site for the miami herald and el nuevo herald newspaper operations

the newspapers plan to relocate their operations from their current location to the new site in may the lease on the office building is an operating lease with initial annual base lease payments of million beginning in may when the building is expected to be occupied 
total costs related to relocating the newspapers operations and for constructing the new production facility  including the purchase of the property  construction costs  accelerated depreciation and moving expenses  is estimated as follows capital expenditures related to the new facilities are estimated to be million 
cash expenses to relocate the miami newspapers operations are expected to be million 
in addition  the company will incur million in accelerated depreciation on existing assets expected to be retired or decommissioned 
million of the cash costs will be reimbursed from an escrow account established for this purpose by the purchaser of the existing miami facilities 
the relocation is expected to be completed in may and  accordingly  the costs and expenses are expected to be incurred over the next approximately months

the costs related to these reductions  including related severance  were recorded as operating expenses and were largely paid in the years the reductions were implemented 
newsprint newsprint prices are volatile and are largely dependent on global demand and supply for newsprint 
in  supply and demand were largely in balance as the result of higher export demand and reductions in capacity 
as a result  producers were able to increase prices in fiscal in  newsprint supply exceeded demand and  as a result  there were no additional price increases in nevertheless  newsprint prices were higher in fiscal than in as a result of the price increases during no price increases have been announced in significant changes in newsprint prices can increase or decrease the company s operating expenses and  therefore  directly affect the company s operating results 
however  because the company has ownership interests in newsprint producer ponderay  an increase in newsprint prices  while negatively affecting the 
table of contents company s operating expenses  would increase its share of earnings from this investment 
a decline in newsprint prices would have the opposite effect 
ponderay is also impacted by the higher cost of energy and fiber used in the paper making process

recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are amortization and or impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  pension and 
table of contents post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  and the company s accounting for income taxes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible impairment the company tests for goodwill annually at year end or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such indicators of impairment may include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate such as an economic downturn  significant operating cash flow declines related to its newspapers or a major change in the assessment of future operations of its newspapers  or a sustained decline in the company s stock price below the per share book value of stockholders equity 
the company conducted its annual impairment testing at the end of its fiscal years in  and summary of approach and analysis of impairments the required two step approach to test for impairment requires the use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
because accounting standards require that impairment testing be done at a reporting unit level  the company performs this testing on its operating segments which are considered reporting units 
an impairment charge generally is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
in summary the company conducts its tests and considers the following factors the fair value of the company s reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the projected cash flows are based on estimates of revenues  newsprint expenses and other cash costs 
while these estimates are always inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  the ability to project future operations and in particular advertising revenues is difficult 
the discount rate is determined using the company s weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for risks perceived by investors which are implicit in the company s publicly traded stock price 
the amount of a goodwill impairment charge requires management to allocate the fair value of the reporting units to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  using its best judgments and estimates in valuing the reporting unit  to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting total fair value of the reporting units is then reconciled to the market capitalization of the company  giving effect to an appropriate control premium 
a goodwill impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the implied goodwill values are below the book value of goodwill for the reporting units 
fair value calculations by their nature require management to make assumptions about future operating results that can be difficult to predict with certainty 
they are influenced by management s views of future advertising trends in the industry and in the markets in which it operates newspapers 
the variability in these trends and the difficulty in projecting advertising growth  in particular  in each newspaper market are impacted by the unprecedented declines in advertising in recent years 
the company implemented restructuring plans which have mitigated the impact of these declines on its cash flows and helped stabilize operations 
based on management s analysis  at december   the fair values of the company s reporting unit that primarily consists of operations in california  the northwest and texas exceeded the carrying value by approximately and the operating segment that primarily consists of operations in the southeast  the gulf coast and the midwest exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
masthead considerations newspaper mastheads newspaper titles and website domain names are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually at year end  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
table of contents that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each newspaper masthead with its carrying amount 
the company uses a relief from royalty approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each newspaper masthead 
management s judgments and estimates of future operating results in determining the reporting unit fair values are consistently applied to each newspaper in determining the fair value of each newspaper masthead 
the company performed its annual impairment tests on newspaper mastheads as of december   december   and december  as a result of its testing  the company recorded a charge of million for masthead impairments in fiscal no impairment charges to the value of mastheads were recorded in or other intangible assets considerations long lived assets such as intangible assets are subject to amortization primarily advertiser and subscriber lists and are tested for recoverability whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of each asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset group 
no impairment loss was recognized on intangible assets subject to amortization in  or pension and post retirement benefits on february   the company announced a decision to freeze its defined benefit pension plans as of march  the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
current standards of accounting for defined benefit pension plans and post retirement benefit plans requires recognition of the funded status of a pension plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation and the funded status of a post retirement plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the accumulated benefit obligation  as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at december   net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of plan assets for the company s qualified plan netted to a million liability at december  at december   net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of plan assets for the company s qualified plan netted to a million liability at december  the company used discount rates of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate its retirement expenses in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more in depth discussion of the company s policies in setting its key assumptions related to these obligations 
for fiscal a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on the company s net benefit cost a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have decreased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million 

table of contents income taxes the company s current and deferred income tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if needed  throughout the year 
adjustments between the company s estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to periodic audits by federal and state taxing authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
these audits may challenge certain aspects of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future periods 
insurance the company is insured for workers compensation using both self insurance and large deductible programs 
the company relies on claims experience in determining an adequate provision for insurance claims 
the company used a discount rate of to calculate workers compensation reserves as of december  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have had an immaterial effect on total workers compensation reserves 
a increase in the claims would have increased the total workers compensation reserves by approximately million
