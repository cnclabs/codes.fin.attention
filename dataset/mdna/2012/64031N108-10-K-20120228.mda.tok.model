maximize the value of existing portfolio fixed rate floor income loans originated prior to april  generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable indice plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company earns additional spread income that it refers to as floor income 
for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company earns floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income 
the company has earned fixed rate floor income as summarized below year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net fixed rate floor income contribution to spread  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income 
the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during and are due to historically low interest rates 
in addition  the amount increased due to the purchase of the residual interest in billion of consolidation loans in july if interest rates remain low  the company anticipates continuing to earn significant fixed rate floor income in future periods 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  which provides additional detail on the company s portfolio earning fixed rate floor income and the derivatives used by the company to hedge these loans 
future cash flow from portfolio the majority of the company s portfolio of student loans is funded in asset backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturity of the funded assets  thereby minimizing liquidity risk 
in addition  due to i the difference between the yield the company receives on the loans and cost of financing within these transactions  and ii the servicing and administration fees the company earns from these transactions  the company has created a portfolio that will generate earnings and significant cash flow over the life of these transactions 
as of december   based on cash flow models developed to reflect management s current estimate of  among other factors  prepayments  defaults  deferment  forbearance  and interest rates  the company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its portfolio to be approximately billion 
a further description of these future cash flows can be found in this item under liquidity and capital resources 
use liquidity to capitalize on market opportunities the company has used and will continue to use its improved liquidity position to capitalize on market opportunities  including ffelp student loan acquisitions  strategic acquisitions and investments in its core business areas of loan financing  loan servicing  payment processing  and enrollment services education planning  and capital management initiatives  including stock repurchases  debt repurchases  and dividend distributions 
during  the company has used its improved liquidity to accomplish the following items ffelp student loan acquisitions purchased billion of ffelp student loans acquisitions and investments in core business areas purchased contracts with more than k schools to provide tuition payment plan services capital management repurchased  shares of common stock for million per share repurchased million notional amount of debt recognizing a gain of million raised the quarterly dividend paid on the company s common stock to per share million in total dividends paid in results of operations the company s operating results are primarily driven by the performance of its existing portfolio and the revenues generated by its fee based businesses and the costs to provide such services 
the performance of the company s portfolio is driven by interest income and losses related to credit quality of the assets along with the cost to administer and service the assets and related debt 
net interest income the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from the spread  referred to as its student loan spread  between the yield the company receives on its student loan portfolio and the cost of funding these loans 
this spread income is reported on the company s consolidated statements of income as net interest income 
the amortization accretion of loan premiums and discounts  including capitalized costs of origination  the per year consolidation loan rebate fee paid to the department  and yield adjustments from borrower benefit programs  are netted against loan interest income on the company s consolidated statements of income 
the amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of income 
investment interest income  which is a component of net interest income  includes income from unrestricted interest earning deposits and investments and funds in the company s special purpose entities  which are utilized for its asset backed securitizations 
net interest income also includes interest expense on unsecured debt offerings 
the proceeds from these unsecured debt offerings were used by the company to fund general business operations and certain asset and business acquisitions 
provision for loan losses management estimates and establishes an allowance for loan losses through a provision charged to expense 
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of the loan principal is unlikely 
recovery of amounts previously charged off is credited to the allowance for loan losses 
management maintains the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans at a level believed to be appropriate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
the company analyzes the allowance separately for its federally insured loans and its non federally insured loans 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the federal government guarantees percent of the principal of and the interest on federally insured student loans disbursed on and after july  and percent for those loans disbursed prior to july   which limits the company s loss exposure on the outstanding balance of the company s federally insured portfolio 
student loans disbursed prior to october  are fully insured 
in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  type of program  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest is days past due and charges off the loan and accrued interest when the collection of principal and interest is days past due

operating segments the company earns fee based revenue through its student loan and guaranty servicing  tuition payment processing and campus commerce  and enrollment services operating segments 
in addition  the company earns interest income on its student loan portfolio in its asset generation and management operating segment 
the company s operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve  and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management 
the accounting policies of the company s operating segments are the same as those described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
intersegment revenues are charged by a segment to another segment that provides the product or service 
intersegment revenues and expenses are included within each segment consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management 
changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information 
in  the company began allocating certain corporate overhead expenses to the individual operating segments 
these expenses include certain corporate activities related to executive management  human resources  accounting  legal  occupancy  and marketing 
these costs are allocated to each operating segment based on estimated use of such activities and services 
these allocations were not made in  and thus are not reflected in the segment operating results 
the management reporting process measures the performance of the company s operating segments based on the management structure of the company as well as the methodology used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources 
management  including the company s chief operating decision maker  evaluates the performance of the company s operating segments based on their profitability 
as discussed further below  management measures the profitability of the company s operating segments based on base net income 
accordingly  information regarding the company s operating segments is provided based on base net income 
the company s base net income is not a defined term within generally accepted accounting principles gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting 
base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop the company s financial plans  track results  and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on base net income in operating its business because base net income permits management to make meaningful period to period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of the company s operating segments 
accordingly  the tables presented below reflect base net income  which is reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of the company s operating segments 
reconciliation of the segment totals to the company s consolidated operating results in accordance with gaap are also included in the tables below 
included below under non gaap performance measures is further discussion regarding base net income and its limitations  including a table that details the differences between base net income and gaap net income by operating segment 
income taxes for segment reporting  income taxes are applied based on of income loss before taxes for each individual operating segment 
the difference between the consolidated income tax expense and the sum of taxes calculated for each operating segment is included in income taxes in corporate activity and overhead 
reclassifications certain operating segment amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
these reclassifications include reclassifying software services revenue to loan and guaranty servicing revenue and reclassifying depreciation and amortization  impairment expense  restructure expense  and litigation settlement  which were previously included in other expenses

in addition to evaluating the company s gaap based financial information  management also evaluates the company s operating segments on a non gaap performance measure referred to as base net income for each operating segment 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on base net income to manage each operating segment because management believes these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop financial plans  establish corporate performance targets  allocate resources  track results  evaluate performance  and determine incentive compensation 
accordingly  financial information is reported to management on a base net income basis by operating segment  as these are the measures used regularly by the company s chief operating decision maker 
the company s board of directors utilizes base net income to set performance targets and evaluate management s performance 
the company also believes analysts  rating agencies  and creditors use base net income in their evaluation of the company s results of operations 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company utilizes base net income in operating its business because base net income permits management to make meaningful period to period comparisons by eliminating the temporary volatility in the company s performance that arises from certain items that are primarily affected by factors beyond the control of management 
management believes base net income provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of the company s operations 
limitations of base net income while gaap provides a uniform  comprehensive basis of accounting  for the reasons discussed above  management believes that base net income is an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the company s results of operations 
nevertheless  base net income is subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider 
for example  as stated above  unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting 
the company s base net income is not a defined term within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
investors  therefore  may not be able to compare the company s performance with that of other companies based upon base net income 
base net income results are only meant to supplement gaap results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely monitored and used by the company s management and board of directors to assess performance and information which the company believes is important to analysts  rating agencies  and creditors 
other limitations of base net income arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to gaap results to derive base net income results 
these differences are described below 
the adjustments required to reconcile from the company s base net income measure to its gaap results of operations relate to items that are excluded from management s evaluation of the company s operating results 
the following table reflects adjustments associated with these items by operating segment and corporate activity and overhead student loan and guaranty servicing tuition payment processing and campus commerce enrollment services asset generation and management corporate activity and overhead total year ended december  derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap year ended december  derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap year ended december  derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap a income taxes are applied based on for the individual operating segments 
differences between gaap and base net income management s financial planning and evaluation of operating results does not take into account the following items because their volatility and or inherent uncertainty affect the period to period comparability of the company s results of operations 
a more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and base net income follows 
derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments base net income excludes the periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused by the change in fair value on derivatives used in the company s risk management strategy in which the company does not qualify for hedge treatment under gaap 
as such  the company recognizes changes in fair value of derivative instruments currently in earnings 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
derivative instruments primarily used by the company to manage interest rate risk includes interest rate swaps and basis swaps 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company does not qualify its derivatives for hedge treatment  and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the company believes these point in time estimates of asset and liability values that are subject to interest rate fluctuations make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against its business plan and affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
included in base net income are the economic effects of the company s derivative instruments  which includes any cash paid or received being recognized as an expense or revenue upon actual derivative settlements 
these settlements are included in derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
base net income excludes the foreign currency transaction gains or losses caused by the re measurement of the company s euro denominated bonds to us dollars 
in connection with the issuance of the euro denominated bonds  the company has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  the principal payments on the euro denominated notes will effectively be paid at the exchange rate in effect between the us dollar and euro at the issuance date of the bonds 
the cross currency interest rate swaps also convert the floating rate paid on the euro denominated bonds euribor index to an indice based on libor 
included in base net income are the economic effects of any cash paid or received being recognized as an expense or revenue upon actual settlements of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
these settlements are included in derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
however  the gains or losses caused by the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds to us dollars and the change in market value of the cross currency interest rate swaps are excluded from base net income as the company believes the point in time estimates of value that are subject to currency rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against the company s business plan and affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds generally correlates with the change in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
however  the company will experience unrealized gains or losses related to the cross currency interest rate swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
the gains and or losses included in derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income are primarily caused by interest rate and currency volatility  as well as the volume and terms of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment 
base net income excludes these unrealized gains and losses and isolates the effect of interest rate and currency volatility related to the fair value of such instruments during the period 
under gaap  the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments but not the underlying hedged item tend to show more volatility in the short term 
amortization of intangible assets base net income excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles  which arises primarily from the acquisition of definite life intangible assets in connection with the company s business and asset acquisitions  since the company feels that such charges do not drive the company s operating performance on a long term basis and can affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
compensation related to business combinations the company has structured certain business combinations in which the consideration paid has been dependent on the sellers continued employment with the company 
as such  the value of the consideration paid is recognized as compensation expense by the company over the term of the applicable employment agreement 
base net income excludes this expense because the company believes such charges do not drive its operating performance on a long term basis and can affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
if the company did not enter into the employment agreements in connection with the acquisition  the amount paid to these former shareholders of the acquired entity would have been recorded by the company as additional consideration of the acquired entity  thus  not having an effect on the company s results of operations 
the compensation expense related to these existing agreements was fully expensed in variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives loans that reset annually on july can generate excess spread income compared with the rate based on the special allowance payment formula in declining interest rate environments 
the company refers to this additional income as variable rate floor income 
the company excludes variable rate floor income  net of settlements paid on derivatives used to hedge student loan assets earning variable rate floor income  from its base net income since the timing and amount of variable rate floor income if any is uncertain  it has been eliminated by legislation for all loans originated on and after april   and it is in excess of expected spreads 
in addition  because variable rate floor income is subject to the underlying rate for the subject loans being reset annually on july  it is a factor beyond the company s control which can affect the period to period comparability of results of operations

certain provisions in new gainful employment regulations issued by the department under the higher education act that became effective july  could have an impact on the company s enrollment services operating segment  in connection with services it provides to for profit schools 
the higher education act provides that to be eligible to participate in federal student financial aid programs title iv funds  educational institutions  including for profit schools  must enter into a program participation agreement with the department 
the agreement includes a number of conditions with which an institution must comply to be granted initial and continuing eligibility to participate 
among those conditions is a prohibition on institutions providing any commission  bonus  or other incentive payment to any individual or entity engaged in recruiting or admission activities  based on their success in securing enrollments 
previous regulations included a number of activities  or safe harbors  that did not constitute prohibited incentive compensation 
one of those safe harbors permitted an institution to provide incentive compensation for internet based recruitment and admission activities 
the department s newly issued regulations repeal all existing safe harbors regarding incentive compensation in recruiting  though exempting click based payments to third parties who provide internet generated student contact information 
the new regulations also create liability for misrepresentation in advertisements  offers  and communications presented to prospective students  with associated penalties for noncompliance with these standards 
in addition  these new regulations impose strict liability on educational institutions for misrepresentations made by entities  like the company  who contract with the institutions to provide marketing services 
as a result  the company s school customers have demanded and  in limited circumstances  the company has acquiesced to be subject to increased limitations of liability in its contracts and  in some cases  to indemnify its customers for actions by its third party publishers 
the company has developed proprietary software systems and processes to detect and remediate potential misrepresentation violations 
the department also recently issued new regulations under title iv of the higher education act providing that for profit schools are eligible to participate in title iv student financial aid programs only with respect to educational programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
these regulations  most of which became effective july   require for profit schools to provide prospective students with each eligible program s recognized occupations  cost  completion rate  job placement rate  and median loan debt of those that have completed the program  and provide that title iv funds may not be available to students enrolled in educational programs offered by for profit schools if those programs do not meet certain debt to income ratios and loan repayment metrics to be measured beginning july  significantly all interactive marketing revenue which makes up approximately percent of total revenue included in this segment is generated from for profit schools 
the regulations discussed above may subject the company to greater risk of liability and may increase the company s costs of compliance with these regulations or limit the company s ability to serve for profit schools 
in addition  these regulations could negatively impact enrollment at for profit schools  which could adversely affect interactive marketing revenue

the delinquency trends on the company s portfolio of loans have increased as of december  due to the sustained downturn in the economy 
in addition  the company has focused significant time and resources on the government servicing contract  which has negatively impacted the delinquency performance of its portfolio

these discounts are being accreted using the effective interest method over the lives of the underlying assets liabilities 
a trend analysis of the company s core and variable student loan spreads is summarized below 

cpliborspreadgraph 
jpg 
a the interest earned on the majority of the company s ffelp student loan assets is indexed to the three month commercial paper indice 
the company funds the majority of its assets with the three month libor indexed floating rate securities 
the relationship between these two indices has a significant impact on student loan spread 
this table the right axis shows the difference between the average three month libor and commercial paper indices by quarter 
the company s variable student loan spread was impacted primarily by the following items the tightening widening of the cp libor spread increases decreases variable student loan spread 
historically  the movement of the various interest rate indices received on the company s student loan assets  primarily three month commercial paper  and paid on the debt to fund such loans  primarily libor  was highly correlated 
the short term movement of these indices was dislocated beginning in august  which negatively impacted the company s net interest income through the first half of beginning in the third quarter of  the cp libor spread began to tighten to more historical levels  which had a positive impact on spread 
in  the average cp libor spread was basis points compared to basis points in  which resulted in an improved variable student loan spread in compared with in  the average cp libor spread was basis points compared to basis points in  which resulted in a decrease in variable student loan spread in compared with a decrease in the amortization of loan premiums discounts and deferred origination costs as a result of loans purchased at a discount  reducing the net costs being amortized 
the primary difference between variable student loan spread and core student loan spread is fixed rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives 
a summary of fixed rate floor income and its contribution to core student spread follows year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net fixed rate floor income contribution to spread  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income 
the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during   and are due to historically low interest rates 
in addition  the amount increased due to the purchase of the residual interest in billion of consolidation loans in july if interest rates remain low  the company anticipates continuing to earn significant fixed rate floor income in future periods 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  which provides additional detail on the company s portfolio earning fixed rate floor income and the derivatives used by the company to hedge these loans 
on december   the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of into law 
this act includes changes to the ffelp student lender payment index from the commercial rate to the one month libor rate for the special allowance payment calculation on outstanding ffelp loans held by student loan lenders 
as of december   the company had billion of loans in which it intends to make the election to change the sap calculation to the one month libor rate 
this change mitigates the company s exposure to basis risk and will allow the company to better match borrowing and lending rates

interest expense decreased in compared to due to a decrease in the cost of funds from in to in e during july  the company recorded a discount on bonds and notes payable assumed as a result of the purchase of the residual interest on billion of student loans and related debt 
the bonds and notes payable discount is being accreted using the effective interest method over the lives of the bonds and notes payable 
f depending on the type of loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate on student loans is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company may earn floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income 
a summary of fixed rate floor income follows 
year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income 
the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during the years ended december    and are due to historically low interest rates 
in addition  the amount increased due to the purchase of the residual interest in billion of consolidation loans in july g investment income decreased year over year due to a decrease in interest rates as well as a decrease in average cash held over the same periods 
h the provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the company s portfolio of loans 
the non federally insured loan provision decreased million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to the same periods in and the decrease in from is primarily due to a decrease in the dollar amount of the company s non federally insured student loan portfolio  including those loans in repayment and loans delinquent  as well as continued aging of the portfolio 
the decrease in from is primarily due to the continued aging of the portfolio 
the federally insured loan provision increased million during the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to an increase in delinquent loans 
the federally insured loan provision decreased million for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in delinquent loans 
i the company maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective  however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting 
derivative settlements for each applicable period should be evaluated with the company s net interest income 
other income 
the following table summarizes the components of other income

a summary of gains from the sale of loans and debt repurchases follows year ended december  gain on sale of loans a gain on debt repurchases asset backed securities b gain on sale of loans and debt repurchases  net a included in the gain on sale of loans for the years ended december  and are gains of million and million  respectively  resulting from the sale of billion of student loans in each of these years to the department under a program that provided liquidity to student loan lenders 
b during the years ended december    and  the company repurchased asset backed securities of million  million  and million  respectively 
due to improvements in the capital markets during  the opportunities for the company to repurchase debt at less than par are becoming more limited 
salaries and benefits and other expenses 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an other expense of million related to its obligation to repurchase non federally insured loans 
this expense was recorded due to management s projected performance of the portfolio of loans subject to the repurchase obligation 
excluding this expense  salaries and benefits and other expenses decreased in compared with in addition  salaries and benefits and other expenses decreased significantly in compared to these decreases in and were the result of a reduction in associates as part of the company s restructuring initiatives and continued focus by the company on managing costs  as well as a reduction in marketing costs due the elimination of new loan originations under the ffelp program 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in fees paid to third parties for the servicing of the company s student loan portfolio 
intersegment expenses  net 
intersegment expenses include fees paid to the student loan and guaranty servicing operating segment for the servicing of the company s student loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s fee generating businesses are non capital intensive and all produce positive operating cash flows 
as such  a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to the fee based segments and any liquidity or capital needs are satisfied using cash flow from operations 
therefore  the liquidity and capital resources discussion is concentrated on the company s liquidity and capital needs to meet existing debt obligations in the asset generation and management operating segment 
the company may issue equity and debt securities in the future in order to improve capital  increase liquidity  refinance upcoming maturities  or provide for general corporate purposes 
moreover  the company may from time to time repurchase certain amounts of its outstanding secured and unsecured debt securities  including debt securities which the company may issue in the future  for cash and or through exchanges for other securities 
such repurchases or exchanges may be made in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  compliance with securities laws  and other factors 
the amounts involved in any such transactions may be material 
the company has historically utilized operating cash flow  secured financing transactions which include warehouse facilities  asset backed securitizations  and liquidity programs offered by the department  operating lines of credit  and other borrowing arrangements to fund its asset generation and management operations and student loan acquisitions 
in addition  the company has used operating cash flow  borrowings on its unsecured line of credit  and unsecured debt offerings to fund corporate activities  business acquisitions  and repurchases of common stock 
the company has also used its common stock to partially fund certain business acquisitions 
as of december   the company had million of liquidity available for use as summarized below 
in addition  the company generates a significant amount of cash from operations 
the company will continue to use its strong liquidity position to capitalize on market opportunities  including ffelp student loan acquisitions  strategic acquisitions and investments in its core business areas of loan financing  loan servicing  payment processing  and enrollment services education planning  and capital management initiatives  including stock repurchases  debt repurchases  and dividend distributions 
sources of liquidity currently available the following table details the company s sources of liquidity currently available as of december  sources of primary liquidity cash and cash equivalents investments unencumbered private student loan assets asset backed security investments class b subordinated notes a asset backed security investments b available balance on unsecured line of credit c total sources of primary liquidity a as part of the company s issuance of asset backed securitizations in  due to credit market conditions when these notes were issued  the company purchased the class b subordinated notes of million par value 
these notes are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
if the credit market conditions continue to improve  the company anticipates selling these notes to third parties 
upon a sale to third parties  the company would obtain cash proceeds equal to the market value of the notes on the date of such sale 
the amount included in the table above is the par value of these subordinated notes and may not represent market value upon sale of the notes 
b the company has repurchased its own asset backed securities bonds and notes payable 
for accounting purposes  these notes are effectively retired and are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
however  as of december   million of these securities are legally outstanding at the trust level and the company could sell these notes to third parties or redeem the notes at par as cash is generated by the trust estate 
upon a sale to third parties  the company would obtain cash proceeds equal to the market value of the notes on the date of such sale 
the amount included in the table above is the par value of these notes and may not represent market value upon sale of the notes 
c as of december   the company had a million unsecured line of credit with a maturity date of may  on february   the company entered into a new million unsecured line of credit 
in conjunction with entering into this new agreement  the outstanding balance on the million unsecured line of credit of million was paid off in full and the agreement was terminated 
as of february   the million unsecured line of credit had an outstanding balance of million and million was available for future use 
the million line of credit terminates on february  included in the table above is the amount of availability on the new line of credit as of february  cash generated from operations the company has historically generated positive cash flow from operations 
for the years ended december    and  the company had net cash flow from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
liquidity needs and sources of liquidity available to satisfy debt obligations secured by student loan assets and related collateral the company had the following debt obligations outstanding that are secured by student loan assets and related collateral as of december  carrying amount final maturity asset generation and management bonds and notes issued in asset backed securitizations ffelp warehouse facilities department of education conduit other borrowings bonds and notes issued in asset backed securitizations the majority of the company s portfolio of student loans is funded in asset backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturity of the funded assets  thereby minimizing liquidity risk 
in addition  due to i the difference between the yield the company receives on the loans and cost of financing within these transactions  and ii the servicing and administration fees the company earns from these transactions  the company has created a portfolio that will generate earnings and significant cash flow over the life of these transactions 
as of december   based on cash flow models developed to reflect management s current estimate of  among other factors  prepayments  defaults  deferment  forbearance  and interest rates  the company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its portfolio to be approximately billion as detailed below 
the billion includes approximately million as of december  of overcollateralization included in the asset backed securitizations 
these excess net asset positions are reflected variously in the following balances on the consolidated balance sheet student loans receivable  restricted cash and investments  and accrued interest receivable 
the forecasted cash flow presented below includes all loans currently funded in asset backed securitizations 
as of december   the company had billion of loans included in asset backed securitizations  which represented percent of its total ffelp student loan portfolio 
the forecasted cash flow does not include cash flows that the company expects to receive related to loans funded through the department of education s conduit program and other warehouse facilities or loans acquired subsequent to december

a the company uses various assumptions  including prepayments and future interest rates  when preparing its cash flow forecast 
these assumptions are further discussed below 
prepayments the primary variable in establishing a life of loan estimate is the level and timing of prepayments 
prepayment rates equal the amount of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance  net of scheduled principal payments 
a number of factors can affect estimated prepayment rates  including the level of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  management may revise its assumptions  which in turn would impact the projected future cash flow 
the company s cash flow forecast above assumes prepayment rates that are generally consistent with those utilized in the company s recent asset backed securities transactions 
if management used a prepayment rate assumption two times greater than what was used to forecast the cash flow  the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately million to million 
interest rates the company funds the majority of its student loans with three month libor libor indexed floating rate securities 
meanwhile  the interest earned on the company s student loan assets are indexed primarily to a commercial paper rate cp 
the different interest rate characteristics of the company s loan assets and liabilities funding these assets result in basis risk 
the company s cash flow forecast assumes libor will exceed cp by basis points for the life of the portfolio  which approximates the historical relationship between these indices 
if the forecast is computed assuming a spread of basis points between cp and libor for the life of the portfolio  the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately million to million 
on december   the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of into law 
this act includes changes to the ffelp student lender payment index from the commercial rate to the one month libor rate for the special allowance payment calculation on outstanding ffelp loans held by student loan lenders 
as of december   the company had billion of loans in which it intends to make the election to change the sap calculation to the one month libor rate 
this change mitigates the company s exposure to basis risk and will allow the company to better match borrowing and lending rates 
the company uses the current forward interest rate yield curve to forecast cash flows 
a change in the forward interest rate curve would impact the future cash flows generated from the portfolio 
an increase in future interest rates will reduce the amount of fixed rate floor income the company is currently receiving 
the company attempts to mitigate the impact of a rise in short term rates by hedging interest rate risks 
as of december   the net fair value of the company s interest rate derivatives used to hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income was a liability of million

ffelp warehouse facilities the company funds a portion of its ffelp loan acquisitions using its ffelp warehouse facilities 
student loan warehousing allows the company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
on july   the company renewed the liquidity agreement on its existing ffelp warehouse facility the nfslw i warehouse and entered into an additional ffelp warehouse facility the nhelp i warehouse 
the company s nfslw i warehouse facility has a maximum financing amount of million  with a revolving financing structure supported by day liquidity provisions  which expires on july  the final maturity date of the facility is july  in the event the company is unable to renew the liquidity provisions by july   the facility would become a term facility at a stepped up cost  with no additional student loans being eligible for financing  and the company would be required to refinance the existing loans in the facility by july  the nfslw i warehouse facility provides for formula based advance rates  depending on ffelp loan type  up to a maximum of percent to percent of the principal and interest of loans financed 
the advance rates for collateral may increase or decrease based on market conditions  but they are subject to a minimum advance of to percent based on loan type 
as of december   million was outstanding under the nfslw i warehouse facility  million was available for future use  and million was advanced as equity support 
the nhelp i warehouse has a maximum financing amount of million  with a revolving financing structure supported by day liquidity provisions  which expires on october  the final maturity date of the facility is july  in the event the company is unable to renew the liquidity provisions by october   the facility would become a term facility at a stepped up cost  with no additional student loans being eligible for financing  and the company would be required to refinance the existing loans in the facility by july  the nhelp i warehouse facility provides for formula based advance rates  depending on ffelp loan type  up to a maximum of percent to percent of the principal and interest of loans financed 
the advance rates for collateral may increase or decrease based on market conditions  but they are subject to a minimum advance of to percent based on loan type 
as of december   million was outstanding under the nhelp i warehouse facility  million was available for future use  and million was advanced as equity support 
on february   the company entered into a new ffelp warehouse facility the nhelp ii warehouse 
the nhelp ii warehouse has a maximum financing amount of million  with a revolving financing structure supported by day liquidity provisions  which expire on january  the final maturity date of the facility is january  in the event the company is unable to renew the liquidity provisions by january   the facility would become a term facility at a stepped up cost  with no additional student loans being eligible for financing  and the company would be required to refinance the existing loans in the facility by january  the ffelp warehouse facilities contain financial covenants relating to levels of the company s consolidated net worth  ratio of adjusted ebitda to corporate debt interest  and unencumbered cash 
any violation of these covenants could result in a requirement for the immediate repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the facilities 
upon termination or expiration of the warehouse facilities  the company would expect to access the securitization market  use operating cash  rely on sale of assets  or transfer collateral to satisfy any remaining obligations 
department of education conduit in may  the department implemented a program under which it finances eligible ffelp stafford and plus loans in a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for student lenders the conduit program 
loans eligible for the conduit program had to be first disbursed on or after october   but not later than june   and fully disbursed before september   and meet certain other requirements 
funding for the conduit program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates  with the company being advanced percent of the student loan face amount 
excess amounts needed to fund the remaining percent of the student loan balances were contributed by the company 
the conduit program expires on may  the student loan short term notes student loan notes issued by the conduit program are supported by a combination of i notes backed by ffelp loans  ii a liquidity agreement with the federal financing bank  and iii a put agreement provided by the department 
if the conduit does not have sufficient funds to pay all student loan notes  then those student loan notes will be repaid with funds from the federal financing bank 
the federal financing bank will hold the notes for a short period of time and  if at the end of that time  the student loan notes still cannot be paid off  the underlying ffelp loans that serve as collateral for the conduit program will be sold to the department through a put agreement at a price of percent of the face amount of the loans 
as of december   the company had billion borrowed under the facility and million advanced as equity support in the facility 
effective july   no additional loans could be funded using the conduit program 
the company expects to access the securitization market prior to the conduit program s maturity to refinance the student loan collateral included in the conduit with debt that is structured to match the maturity of the assets 
other liquidity needs on march   president obama signed into law the reconciliation act of effective july   this law prohibits new loan originations under the ffel program and requires that all new federal loan originations be made through the federal direct loan program 
as a result of the reconciliation act of  the company no longer originates new ffelp loans 
due to the legislative changes in the student loan industry  the company believes there will be opportunities to purchase ffelp loan portfolios on behalf of current ffelp participants looking to adjust their ffelp businesses 
the company plans to fund ffelp student loan acquisitions from third parties using its agreement with union bank  as trustee for various grantor trusts  under which union bank has agreed to purchase from the company participation interests in student loans as described below  using its ffelp warehouse facilities as described above  and continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
union bank participation agreement the company maintains an agreement with union bank  as trustee for various grantor trusts  under which union bank has agreed to purchase from the company participation interests in student loans the ffelp participation agreement 
as of december   million of loans were subject to outstanding participation interests held by union bank  as trustee  under this agreement 
the agreement automatically renews annually and is terminable by either party upon five business days notice 
this agreement provides beneficiaries of union bank s grantor trusts with access to investments in interests in student loans  while providing liquidity to the company 
the company can participate loans to union bank to the extent of availability under the grantor trusts  up to million or an amount in excess of million if mutually agreed to by both parties 
loans participated under this agreement have been accounted for by the company as loan sales 
accordingly  the participation interests sold are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
asset backed securities transactions depending on market conditions  the company anticipates continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
asset backed securities transactions would be used to refinance student loans included in the ffelp warehouse facilities  the department of education conduit facility  and or existing asset backed security transactions 
the ffelp warehouse facilities and department conduit facility have advance rates that are less than par 
as of december   the company had approximately million advanced in the ffelp warehouse facilities and approximately million advanced in the department conduit facility 
depending on the terms of asset backed security transactions  refinancing loans included in these facilities could produce positive cash flow to the company by reducing required advance rates and are contemplated by management when making student loan financing decisions 
during  the company completed an asset backed securities transaction totaling million 
notes issued in this asset backed securities transaction carry interest rates based on a spread to libor 
the company used the proceeds from the sale of these notes to purchase principal and interest on student loans  including loans which were previously financed in the nfslw i warehouse facility 
although the company has recently demonstrated its ability to access the asset backed securities market and expects asset backed securities transactions to remain a primary source of funding over the long term  the company also expects its transaction volumes to be more limited and pricing less favorable than prior to the credit market dislocation that began in august  with significantly reduced opportunities to place subordinated tranches of asset backed securities with investors 
at present  the company is unable to predict when market conditions will allow for more regular  reliable  and cost effective access to the term asset backed securities market 
liquidity impact related to hedging activities the company utilizes derivative instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity 
by using derivative instruments  the company is exposed to market risk which could impact its liquidity 
when the fair value of a derivative instrument is negative a liability on the company s balance sheet  it would owe the counterparty if the derivative was settled 
if the negative fair value of derivatives with a counterparty exceeds a specified threshold  the company may have to make a collateral deposit with the counterparty 
the threshold at which the company may be required to post collateral is dependent upon its unsecured credit rating 
based on the company s current unsecured credit ratings standard and poor bbb stable outlook and moody s ba stable outlook  the company has substantially collateralized its corporate derivative liability position with counterparties 
as such  further downgrades would not result in additional collateral requirements of a material nature 
in addition  no counterparty has the right to terminate its contracts in the event of further downgrades 
however  some long dated derivative contracts have mutual optional termination provisions that can be exercised in and as of december   the fair value of derivatives with early termination provisions was a negative million a liability on the company s balance sheet 
based on the derivative portfolio outstanding as of december   the company does not currently anticipate any movement in interest rates having a material impact on its capital or liquidity profile  nor does the company expect that any movement in interest rates would have a material impact on its ability to meet potential collateral deposits with its counterparties 
however  if interest rates moves materially and negatively impacts the fair value of the company s derivative portfolio or if the company enters into additional derivatives in which the fair value of such derivatives become negative  the company could be required to deposit additional collateral with its derivative instrument counterparties 
the collateral deposits  if significant  could negatively impact the company s liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   the fair value of the company s derivatives which had a negative fair value a liability on the company s balance sheet was million and the company had million posted as collateral to derivative counterparties 
description of other debt facilities unsecured line of credit as of december   the company had a million unsecured line of credit with a maturity date of may  as of december   there was million outstanding on this line 
on february   the company entered into a new million unsecured line of credit 
in conjunction with entering into this new agreement  the outstanding balance on the million unsecured line of credit of million was paid off in full and the agreement was terminated 
as of february   the million unsecured line of credit had an outstanding balance of million and million was available for future use 
the million line of credit terminates on february  upon termination in there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this line of credit  find alternative funding  or increase the amount outstanding under the line  if necessary 
the line of credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that  if not met  lead to an event of default under the agreement 
the covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth a minimum adjusted ebitda to recourse indebtedness over the last four rolling quarters a limitation on recourse indebtedness a limitation on the percentage of non federally insured loans in the company s portfolio many of these covenants are duplicated in the company s other lending facilities  including its ffelp warehouse facilities 
a default on the company s ffelp warehouse facilities would result in an event of default on the company s unsecured line of credit that would result in the outstanding balance on the line of credit becoming immediately due and payable 
the company s operating line of credit does not have any covenants related to unsecured debt ratings 
however  changes in the company s ratings as well as the amounts the company borrows have modest implications on the pricing level at which the company obtains funding 
junior subordinated hybrid securities in september  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated hybrid securities hybrid securities  of which million was outstanding as of december  the hybrid securities are unsecured obligations of the company 
the interest rate on the hybrid securities from the date they were issued through the optional redemption date  september   was  payable semi annually 
beginning september  through september   the scheduled maturity date  the interest rate on the hybrid securities is equal to three month libor plus  payable quarterly  which was at december  the principal amount of the hybrid securities will become due on the scheduled maturity date only to the extent that the company has received proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying capital securities prior to such date as defined in the hybrid securities prospectus 
if any amount is not paid on the scheduled maturity date  it will remain outstanding and bear interest at a floating rate as defined in the prospectus  payable monthly 
on september   the company must pay any remaining principal and interest on the hybrid securities in full whether or not the company has sold qualifying capital securities 
at the company s option  the hybrid securities are redeemable in whole or in part  any time on or after september   at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  provided in the case of a redemption in part that the principal amount outstanding after such redemption is at least million

in addition  the payment of dividends is subject to the terms of the company s outstanding hybrid securities  which generally provide that if the company defers interest payments on those securities it cannot pay dividends on its capital stock 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below allowance for loan losses  revenue recognition  impairment assessments related to goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  and accounting for derivatives 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses on student loans 
this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on its federally insured loan portfolio separately from its non federally insured loan portfolio 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  type of program  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest is days past due and charges off the loan and accrued interest when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans and the repurchase obligation related to loans sold are maintained at a level management believes is appropriate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolios 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
revenue recognition student loan income the company recognizes student loan income as earned  net of amortization of loan premiums and discounts and deferred origination costs 
loan income is recognized based upon the expected yield of the loan after giving effect to borrower utilization of incentives such as principal reductions for timely payments borrower benefits and other yield adjustments 
the estimate of the borrower benefits discount is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive and liquidity purposes  the company frequently changed the borrower benefit programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefit discount 
loan premiums discounts  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
the most sensitive estimate related to the amortization accretion of loan premiums discounts  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits is the estimate of the constant prepayment rate cpr 
cpr is a variable in the life of loan estimate that measures the rate at which loans in a portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is directly correlated to the average life of the portfolio 
cpr equals the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance  net of scheduled principal payments 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate  including the level of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the amount of loan premium discount and deferred origination cost amortization recognized by the company in a particular period 
loan and guaranty servicing revenue loan and guaranty servicing revenue consists of the following items loan and guaranty servicing fees loan servicing fees are determined according to individual agreements with customers and are calculated based on the dollar value of loans  number of loans  or number of borrowers serviced for each customer 
guaranty servicing fees  generally  are calculated based on the number of loans serviced  volume of loans serviced  or amounts collected 
revenue is recognized when earned pursuant to applicable agreements  and when ultimate collection is assured

delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a qualified inquiry or click is delivered to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain 
from time to time  the company may agree to credit certain inquiries or clicks if they fail to meet the contractual or other guidelines of a particular client 
the company has established a sales reserve based on historical experience 
to date  such credits have been immaterial and within management s expectations 
for a portion of its interactive marketing revenue  the company has agreements with providers of online media or traffic publishers used in the generation of inquiries or clicks 
the company receives a fee from its customers and pays a fee to publishers either on a cost per inquiry  cost per click  or cost per number of impressions basis 
the company is the primary obligor in the transaction 
as a result  the fees paid by the company s customers are recognized as revenue and the fees paid to its publishers are included in cost to provide enrollment services in the company s consolidated statements of income 
list marketing revenue from the sale of lists is generally earned and recognized  net of estimated returns  upon delivery 
publishing services revenue from the sale of print products is generally earned and recognized  net of estimated returns  upon shipment or delivery 
resource centers resource centers services include online courses  scholarship search and selection data  career planning  and online information about colleges and universities 
the majority of these services are sold based on subscriptions and or are performance based 
revenues from sales of subscription and performance based services are recognized ratably over the term of the contract as earned 
subscription and performance based revenues received or receivable in advance of the delivery of services is included in deferred revenue 
fees associated with the majority of the services described above are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties 
the company assesses collectability of revenues and its allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to record accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
if the company determines that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured at or prior to delivery of the company s services  revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of november and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the operating segment  or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 
however  components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics 
in april  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing for goodwill impairment asu 
this asu amends fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  to simplify how an entity tests for goodwill impairment by allowing entities to first assess certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of certain events or circumstances would lead to a determination that it would be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  instead of first performing a fair value analysis for each reporting unit 
entities that conclude  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount are not required to perform the two step impairment test 
this guidance became effective on september  for annual and interim impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted 
the company adopted the new guidance for its annual goodwill impairment test 
as of november   the company assessed qualitative factors and concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units were less than their carrying amount 
as such  the company was not required to perform the two step impairment test 
the new accounting guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance  and entity specific events 
the examples of events and circumstances are not intended to be all inclusive  and an entity may identify other relevant events or circumstances to consider in determining whether to perform the first step of the two step impairment test 
none of the individual examples of events and circumstances are intended to represent standalone events or circumstances that necessarily would require an entity to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
in reaching its conclusion about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company also considered the extent to which an adverse event or circumstance  if any  effected the reporting unit s fair value 
the company placed more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect a reporting unit s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets 
the company also considered positive and mitigating events and circumstances 
in addition  the company compared recent fair value calculations of reporting units  when available  to the carrying amount of the reporting units in deciding whether the first step of the impairment test was necessary 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets annually and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist 
each quarter the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
the company s evaluation of whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount and assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of the company s intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and internal forecasts 
although the company believes the historical assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the reported financial results 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the u 
s and its states and municipalities in which the company operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
the company reviews these balances quarterly and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted  as appropriate 
derivative accounting the company records derivative instruments at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
the company determines the fair value for its derivative contracts using either i pricing models that consider current market conditions and the contractual terms of the derivative contract or ii counterparty valuations 
these factors include interest rates  time value  forward interest rate curve  and volatility factors  as well as foreign exchange rates 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings 
net settlements on derivatives are included in derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the consolidated statements of income 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu  a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring 
this asu amends fasb asc topic  receivables  to clarify when a loan restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring 
under the new guidance  student loans for which concessions are granted may now be considered troubled debt restructurings that were previously not 
this guidance became effective july   applied retrospectively to january  the company has determined this new guidance has no impact on its student loan receivable portfolio 
in april  the fasb issued asu see critical accounting policies goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments related to the company s adoption of this standard 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income  presentation of comprehensive income 
the objective of this asu is to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance will be applied retrospectively for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  this guidance will be effective for the company in the first quarter as of the filing date of this report  the company had not completed its evaluation of this new guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all dollars are in thousands  except share amounts  unless otherwise noted interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could impact the company due to shifts in market interest rates 
because the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet is a key profitability driver 
the following table sets forth the company s loan assets and debt instruments by rate characteristics as of december  as of december  dollars percent dollars percent fixed rate loan assets variable rate loan assets total fixed rate debt instruments variable rate debt instruments total loans originated prior to april  generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable indice plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company may earn additional spread income that it refers to as floor income 
depending on the type of loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company may earn floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income  and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on july  the company may earn floor income to the next reset date  which the company refers to as variable rate floor income 
in accordance with legislation enacted in  lenders are required to rebate fixed rate floor income and variable rate floor income to the department for all new ffelp loans first originated on or after april  a summary of fixed rate floor income follows 
year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income 
the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during   and are due to historically low interest rates 
in addition  the amount increased due to the purchase of the residual interest in billion of consolidation loans in july if interest rates remain low  the company anticipates continuing to earn significant fixed rate floor income in future periods 
absent the use of derivative instruments  a rise in interest rates may reduce the amount of floor income received and this may have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increasing financing costs  until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with their special allowance payment formulas 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively become variable rate loans  the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced 
the following graph depicts fixed rate floor income for a borrower with a fixed rate of and a sap rate of

the following table shows the company s student loan assets that are earning fixed rate floor income as of december  borrower estimated balance of fixed lender variable assets earning fixed rate interest weighted conversion floor income as of rate range average yield rate a december  a the estimated variable conversion rate is the estimated short term interest rate at which loans would convert to a variable rate 
as of december   the short term interest rate was basis points 
the following table summarizes the outstanding derivative instruments as of december  used by the company to hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income 
notional weighted average fixed rate paid by the company a maturity amount a for all interest rate derivatives  the company receives discrete three month libor 
as of december   the company had billion of student loan assets that were eligible to earn variable rate floor income 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of the company s assets do not match the interest rate characteristics of the funding 
the company attempts to match the interest rate characteristics of certain pools of loan assets with debt instruments of substantially similar characteristics 
due to the variability in duration of the company s assets and varying market conditions  the company does not attempt to perfectly match the interest rate characteristics of the entire loan portfolio with the underlying debt instruments 
the company has adopted a policy of periodically reviewing the mismatch related to the interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities together with the company s outlook as to current and future market conditions 
based on those factors  the company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy 
derivative instruments used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy currently include interest rate swaps  basis swaps  and cross currency swaps 
the following table presents the company s ffelp student loan assets and related funding arranged by underlying indices as of december  index frequency of variable resets assets debt outstanding that funded student loan assets a month h financial commercial paper b daily month treasury bill varies month libor c quarterly month libor monthly auction rate or remarketing d varies asset backed commercial paper e varies other f a the company has certain basis swaps outstanding in which the company receives three month libor and pays one month libor plus or minus a spread as defined in the agreements the basis swaps 
the company entered into these derivative instruments to better match the interest rate characteristics on its student loan assets and the debt funding such assets 
the following table summarizes these derivatives as of december  maturity notional amounts b the company s ffelp student loans earn interest based on the daily average day h financial commercial paper index calculated on a fiscal quarter 
c the company has euro denominated notes that reprice on the euribor index 
the company has entered into derivative instruments cross currency interest rate swaps that convert the euribor index to three month libor 
as a result  these notes are reflected in the three month libor category in the above table 
see foreign currency exchange risk 
d the interest rates on certain of the company s asset backed securities are set and periodically reset via a dutch auction auction rate securities or through a remarketing utilizing remarketing agents variable rate demand notes 
as of december   the company is sponsor on million of auction rate securities and million of variable rate demand notes 
for auction rate securities  investors and potential investors submit orders through a broker dealer as to the principal amount of notes they wish to buy  hold  or sell at various interest rates 
the broker dealers submit their clients orders to the auction agent  who then determines the clearing interest rate for the upcoming period 
interest rates on these auction rate securities are reset periodically  generally every to days  by the auction agent or agents 
during the first quarter of  as part of the credit market crisis  auction rate securities from various issuers failed to receive sufficient order interest from potential investors to clear successfully  resulting in failed auction status 
since february   the company s auction rate securities have failed in this manner 
under normal conditions  banks have historically purchased these securities when investor demand is weak 
however  since february  banks have been allowing auctions to fail 
currently  all of the company s auction rate securities are in a failed auction status and the company believes they will remain in a failed status for an extended period of time and possibly permanently 
as a result of a failed auction  the auction rate securities will generally pay interest to the holder at a maximum rate as defined by the indenture 
while these rates will vary  they will generally be based on a spread to libor or treasury securities  or the net loan rate as defined in the financing documents 
due to the failed auctions related to these securities  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
for variable rate demand notes  the remarketing agents set the price  which is then offered to investors 
if there are insufficient potential bid orders to purchase all of the notes offered for sale  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
e asset backed commercial paper consists of million funded in the company s ffelp warehouse facilities and billion funded through the department s conduit program 
funding for the conduit program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates 
f assets include restricted cash and investments and other assets 
debt outstanding includes other debt obligations secured by student loan assets and related collateral 
on december   the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of into law 
this act includes changes to the ffelp student lender payment index from the commercial paper rate to the one month libor rate for the special allowance payment calculation on outstanding ffelp loans held by student loan lenders 
as of december   the company had billion of loans in which it intends to make the election to change the sap calculation to the one month libor rate 
this change mitigates the company s exposure to basis risk and will allow the company to better match borrowing and lending rates 
the company currently expects the new formula to be developed and available for use in the second quarter of financial statement impact of derivative instruments the company recognizes changes in the fair value of derivative instruments currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting  consequently  the change in fair value of these derivative instruments is included in the company s operating results 
changes or shifts in the forward yield curve and fluctuations in currency rates can significantly impact the valuation of the company s derivatives 
accordingly  changes or shifts to the forward yield curve and fluctuations in currency rates will impact the financial position and results of operations of the company

as a result of these transactions  the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and euro 
the principal and accrued interest on these notes is re measured at each reporting period and recorded on the company s balance sheet in us dollars based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date 
changes in the principal and accrued interest amounts as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in the derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments and derivative settlements  net in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps in connection with the issuance of the euro notes 
under the terms of these derivative instrument agreements  the company receives from a counterparty a spread to the euribor indice based on notional amounts of million and million and pays a spread to the libor indice based on notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
in addition  under the terms of these agreements  all principal payments on the euro notes will effectively be paid at the exchange rate in effect between the us dollar and euro as of the issuance of the notes
