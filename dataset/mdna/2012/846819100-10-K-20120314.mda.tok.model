we define roic as operating income from continuing operations  less tax on income from continuing operations  divided by total shareholders equity 
roic for the year ended december  was  a basis point decrease as compared to roic of in due to declines in our operating performance as discussed below 
during  and  we undertook restructuring activities  pertaining to continuing operations  to help align expenses with current and future revenue expectations

these changes in revenue are discussed more fully below in the description of our segments 
cost of products sold decreased by million or from million in to million in  driven by the decrease in sales volume year over year 
cost of products sold as a percent of revenue increased by basis points from of sales in to of sales in due to higher restructuring costs in  a change in the mix of products sold and a lower absorption of fixed costs due to the lower sales volumes  mainly within our specialty vehicles segment markets

income taxes for the year ended december  decreased by million or from million in to million in due to the decrease in income from continuing operations  which was partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate 
our effective rate for increased to compared to in  primarily due to higher non deductible expenses in relation to the reduced pre tax income in  as compared to in addition  the effective rate for was impacted by higher research and development tax credits applied for during that year  compared with see note  taxes on income  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding our income taxes

year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated sales increased by million or from million in to million in the increase was mainly due to the acquisition of utilimaster on november  excluding utilimaster  sales fell million or from million in to million in this decrease is mainly attributed to a million decrease in sales of aftermarket parts and assemblies  primarily due to lower sales of defense related service parts 
helping to offset the decrease in aftermarket parts and assemblies was a million increase in motor home revenues from million in to million in  reflecting improving market conditions for motor homes 
there were no significant changes associated with pricing on our products 
cost of products sold increased by million or from million in to million in  driven by the increased sales volume related to the utilimaster acquisition and higher restructuring costs incurred in excluding utilimaster and restructuring charges  cost of products sold decreased by million or  largely reflecting the reduced sales levels in our specialty vehicles segment 
cost of products sold as a percent of revenue increased by percentage points from of sales in to of sales in due to a change in the mix of products sold 
sales in included a larger percentage of higher margin products such as aftermarket parts and assemblies  as compared to which included a higher proportion of sales from lower margin delivery and service vehicles and motor home chassis 
gross margin as a percent of sales decreased from in to in due to the product mix change discussed above 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million or to million from million in this increase is due to the acquisition of utilimaster in as a percent of sales  operating expenses decreased basis points from in to in excluding the impact of utilimaster  operating expenses decreased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in operating expense excluding utilimaster is a reflection of our continued focus on realigning our cost structure see note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
while we successfully reduced operating expenses in  we continued to emphasize product development  spending million on research and development for new product innovations including the reach commercial van that was developed in partnership with isuzu  along with continued development on cab and chassis related to the emissions compliant engines 
income taxes for the year ended december  decreased by million or from million in to million in due to the decrease in income from continuing operations  along with a decrease in our effective tax rate

our segments based on our management structure and the processes employed for allocating resources across our business by our chief operating decision makers  we operate in two reportable business segments specialty vehicles  which consists of our emergency response chassis  motor home chassis  specialty vehicle chassis  emergency response bodies and related aftermarket parts and assemblies operations  and delivery and service vehicles  consisting of utilimaster 
for certain financial information related to each segment  see note  business segments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
specialty vehicles income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage sales net income segment assets year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in our specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or from to the decreases were led by aftermarket parts and assemblies which decreased by million or to million in as defense related sales continue to decline  reflecting the completion of our large military orders in also contributing to the decrease in sales were decreases in emergency response chassis of million or to million in  reflecting the softness in this market due to tightening municipal budgets as well as the impact of orders pulled ahead into and as a result of the engine emissions changes 
sales of our motor home chassis decreased by million or to million as the motor home market trended away from the premium class a market that we support 
sales of other vehicles  which include drill rigs  defense related and other specialized vehicles and chassis  decreased by million or to million in  driven by decreases in defense related sales 
there were no significant changes in the pricing of the products in our specialty vehicles segment 
while we are enacting strategies to increase market penetration and profitability in the emergency response chassis market  we expect that market to remain difficult in  reflecting the impact of constrained municipal budgets 
we also expect to experience continued revenue weakness in the motor home chassis market in due to the expected loss of a major customer and continued market softness 
defense related orders are expected to remain at reduced levels  impacting our aftermarket parts and assemblies and  to a lesser extent  our other vehicles markets 
we expect to show improvement in our emergency response bodies market  as a result of increased selling efforts  especially those focused on markets outside the united states 
net income for our specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or to a net loss of million in  driven by the sales declines described above  which resulted in unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead and other fixed costs 
the decline in sales and related gross income was partially offset by significant reductions in operating expenses due to cost containment efforts and the restructuring activities enacted in the second quarter of  which led to a pre tax reduction of approximately million  year over year 
backlog for our specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or to million at december  from million at december  we experienced backlog decreases in all markets served by this segment due to the difficult market conditions in year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in our specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or from to aftermarket parts and assemblies sales drove the majority of the sales decrease  with a million or decrease from million in to million in the decrease in aftermarket parts and assemblies sales was mainly attributed to declining sales related to military products  particularly the mrap vehicles that were produced in and also contributing to the sales decrease was a decline in emergency response chassis sales of million or year over year  due to an increase in orders and sales in related to the emissions changes  along with a softening of the overall emergency response vehicle market due to tightening state and municipal budgets 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in motor home chassis sales  which increased by million or from million in to million in as the overall market for motor homes showed a marked improvement 
our backlog of orders for our specialty vehicles segment at year end decreased by million or to million in from million in while our backlog decreased in all of our specialty vehicles product lines  the main driver of the overall decrease was a million or decrease in backlog for our emergency response chassis to million in from million in this decrease in emergency response chassis backlog reflects the pull ahead orders received in in advance of the engine emissions change  as well as the softening of the overall emergency response vehicle market in there were no changes in pricing of our products that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing year over year 
net income decreased by million or in to million or of sales compared to million or of sales in  due to the decline in revenues year over year  along with an unfavorable product sales mix in as compared to as aftermarket parts and assemblies  which carry higher margins  made up a lesser proportion of revenues in our focus on cost containment  which led to a reduction in operating expenses of approximately from to  along with a lower effective tax rate due to the utilization of research and development tax credits  helped reduce the impact of the lower revenue levels and unfavorable sales mix in backlog for our specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or to million at december  from million at december   mainly due to reductions in backlog for emergency vehicle chassis and bodies due to fulfillment of orders accelerated into in anticipation of the engine emissions changes  along with an overall softening of these markets in delivery and service vehicles income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage sales net income segment assets represents one month of activity due to acquisition of utilimaster on november  year ended december  compared to year ended december  we experienced a strong year with our delivery and service vehicles segment  with sales of million in  an increase of million or compared to this increase was driven by the introduction of aftermarket parts and assemblies for the delivery and service market  including keyless entry systems  safe loading systems and shelving  and an approximately increase in the volume of units sold in compared to pricing increases on certain vehicles produced by our delivery and service vehicles segment  which were largely offset by material cost increases  contributed approximately million to the increased sales year over year 
we expect sales in our delivery and service vehicles segment to remain strong for  aided by increased demand following several years of lower than average industry shipments  the recently introduced reach commercial van  which began shipping in january of  and continued strong sales of the aftermarket parts and assemblies described above 
net income for our delivery and service vehicles segment increased by million to million for the year ended december   reflecting stronger margins as a result of favorable absorption of overhead and fixed expenses due to the volume increases and favorable product mix as a result of the introduction of the aftermarket parts and assemblies described above 
partially offsetting the sales related gains was an approximately increase in operating expenses  due mainly to higher selling expenses as a result of the increased sales volumes 
backlog for our delivery and service vehicles segment increased by million or to million at december  from million at december   reflecting the strong growth that the delivery and service vehicles market experienced in year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales at our delivery and service vehicles segment ended significantly higher in as encompassed only one month of operations following our acquisition of utilimaster on november  delivery and service vehicles sales represented of consolidated revenue for there were no changes in pricing of our products that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing year over year 
net income for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by elevated levels of r d spending  including million related to the reach commercial van 
comparisons of net income with the year ended december  are not meaningful as included only one month of activity for this segment  following the acquisition of utilimaster on november  backlog for our delivery and service vehicles segment decreased by million or to million at december  from million in our backlog at december  included a large fleet order that was filled early in in addition  fleet customers of our delivery and service vehicles segment tend to place large orders on a periodic basis  which can cause larger shifts in timing and volume compared with our other product lines 
fourth quarter results historically  our sales levels have varied from quarter to quarter 
for a description of quarterly financial data  see note  quarterly financial data unaudited  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
sales for the fourth quarter were million  a decrease of million  or  from our sales in the third quarter of the decrease was driven by a decrease of million or in delivery and service vehicles sales due to seasonal decreases in aftermarket parts and assemblies sales and walk in van sales related to our customary fourth quarter slowdown due to the busy holiday delivery season 
in addition  in late december we delayed shipment until of certain walk in vans in order to affect updates to meet certain regulatory safety requirements 
based on the likelihood that no recall would be necessary to modify affected walk in vans already in operation  as well as the immaterial amount of a potential recall campaign  we did not accrue any liability in for future repair or retrofit costs related to this regulatory safety requirement 
this decrease was partially offset by sales increases in our specialty vehicles segment which showed an increase of million or from third quarter of contributing to the increase in specialty vehicles sales were emergency response chassis  motor home chassis and emergency response bodies sales  which increased million  million and million respectively  with an offsetting decrease in defense related and other specialty vehicles of million 
gross profit in the fourth quarter decreased by million or from third quarter this was driven primarily by the seasonal volume decrease in our delivery and service vehicles segment  as discussed above  offset by an increase in specialty vehicles sales 
net earnings for the fourth quarter decreased million or from the third quarter 
the decrease in net income was impacted substantially by the sales decline in delivery and service vehicles described above 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases in sales in our specialty vehicles segment  along with lower general and administrative expense  driven by lower research and development spending as the reach product neared production 
we finished with a strong fourth quarter  with sales of million  an increase of million or over the third quarter of and substantially higher than the first and second quarters 
the sales increase in the fourth quarter of was mainly due to sales at our delivery and service vehicles segment  which were up million or more than from the third quarter of  which is attributed to strong fleet sales during the quarter 
offsetting this increase was a million or decrease in sales for the fourth quarter of in our specialty vehicles segment as compared with the prior quarter 
the decreases in specialty vehicles segment sales was due to declines in motor home chassis sales  which tend to be seasonal  along with declines in aftermarket parts and assemblies and specialty chassis  both of which were largely due to defense related sales declines  along with a decrease in fire truck chassis sales 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in fire truck body sales  which was due to a shift toward higher priced units in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of gross profit for the fourth quarter of decreased slightly from the third quarter  due mainly to a less favorable product mix for the fourth quarter  which more than offset the increase in sales volume 
as compared to the first two quarters of  gross profit in the fourth quarter was higher  owing to an increase in sales volume overall  as well as higher volumes in aftermarket parts and assemblies  which tend to carry higher margins 
net earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of of million continued the higher trend started in the third quarter  as a result of the increased revenue and steady gross profit levels discussed above  as well as reduced sg a expense as compared with the first half of the year 
also impacting net earnings from continuing operations in the quarter were research and development tax credits that were recorded during the quarter  which helped to reduce our effective tax rate to for the fourth quarter 
sales during the fourth quarter of were slightly lower than the prior quarters of  after excluding the sales of utilimaster  which was acquired on november  sales were lower primarily due to the decrease in aftermarket parts and assemblies sales within the other product grouping of the specialty vehicles segment 
these declines were offset in part by increases in motor home sales which continued to show an upward trend when comparing the previous three quarters 
in addition  fire truck chassis and bodies both showed upward trends during the course of the year 
we believe that the engine emissions change positively impacted the sales increases 
gross profit was disproportionate in the fourth quarter of  showing trend lines down compared to the previous quarters primarily due to sales mix 
there were lower volumes of specialty vehicle and aftermarket parts and assemblies sales in the latter half of the year 
in addition  there were depressed margins at utilimaster due to a one time inventory valuation charge of million incurred during december related to the adjustment of the acquired finished goods and work in process inventory to fair market value 
in addition to the items detailed above  net earnings from continuing operations during the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by one time pre tax charges of million related to the company s acquisition of utilimaster  exclusive of the million noted above 
financial condition balance sheet at december  compared to december  accounts receivable decreased by million or to million at december  due to our ongoing emphasis on cash conversion and receivables collections and a decrease in sales for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of we reduced our receivable days sales outstanding to days sales at december   a decrease of days from the days sales outstanding at december  inventory levels increased by million  or to million at december   mainly due to a delay in shipments from our delivery and service vehicles segment at year end  as discussed above 
property  plant and equipment decreased by million or to million at december   reflecting depreciation taken in of million  impairment charges against a disused building of million and tooling from a discontinued product line of million  and other disposals of million 
these decreases were partially offset by investments of million  and million for assets related to our acquisition of classic fire 
goodwill increased by million or to million at december  as a result of our acquisition of classic fire on april  accounts payable increased by million or to million at december   mainly due to the increases in sales and production activity in our delivery and service vehicles segment 
deposits from customers increased by million or to million at december   mainly due to the timing of customer payments received in the last few days of the year and the election of certain customers to make deposits on orders 
balance sheet at december  compared to december  accounts receivable increased million or from million at december  to million at december  accounts receivable days outstanding improved from days at december  to days at december   driven by higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of as compared with the fourth quarter of  along with a focused effort on improving our working capital 
inventory levels decreased by million or from million at december  to million at december  this decrease is the result of a focused effort to reduce inventory levels across all of our operations and better align our working capital with anticipated sales levels 
assets of discontinued operations of million at december  reflect the assets of our road rescue  inc subsidiary  which we divested in september the reduction in property  plant and equipment of million reflects depreciation of million  offset by million of capital acquisitions  including approximately million to support the reach commercial van  which began production in january of accrued compensation and related taxes decreased million or  from million to million year over year due to lower compensation expense related to incentive plans 
the lower compensation expense for incentive plans is a result of the lower financial results year over year  combined with lower staffing levels as part of our cost realignment activities 
deposits from customers decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  the lower level of deposits was mainly due to the reduction of deposits for pre emissions engines as products were delivered 
current portion of long term debt decreased by million or to million at december  from million at december  long term debt decreased by million or to million at december  from million at december  these decreases in debt were enabled by our strong cash flows from continuing operations  in addition to the approximately million net cash received from the sale of our road rescue  inc subsidiary 
see note  debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding debt 
other current liabilities and accrued expenses increased million or to million at december  from million at december   due to an accrual for a payment on a supplier agreement along with increases in insurance and property tax accruals year over year 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in item of this form k  are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to a balance of million as of december  these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance the company s foreseeable liquidity and capital needs

the actions we took allowed us to maintain profitability despite the fall in sales volumes in cost reduction measures included workforce reductions  plant and operation consolidations and overall improved cost management 
an increased focus on our cash conversion cycle in helped us to maintain our working capital at a level similar to the prior year 
efforts to reduce inventory and other balance sheet items drove working capital levels down in  particularly in light of the addition of utilimaster

working capital our working capital is summarized in the following table in thousands as of december  current assets current liabilities working capital working capital increased from december  to december  by million to million  driven by the changes in cash  accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and deposits from customers  as described above 
the working capital decrease from to was impacted primarily by a million decrease in inventory and the divesture of substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of our road rescue  inc subsidiary  which were classified as held for sale and included in current assets and current liabilities at december  contingent obligations in connection with the acquisition of classic fire on april  and utilimaster on november   we incurred contingent obligations that become due in the first quarter of through in the form of certain performance based earn out payments  up to an aggregate maximum amount of million for classic fire and million for utilimaster 
in accordance with accounting guidance  we recorded the estimated fair value of the future consideration on the acquisition dates and subsequently adjusted the balances to reflect amortization of the discount and changes in the subsidiaries expected performance  resulting in a balance of million at december   including million classified as current and million classified as long term  based upon the likelihood of the payments  discounted to the reporting date

critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is intended to supplement note  general and summary of accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within the company s operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related statement of income  asset and or liability amounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative guidelines  including those of the sec 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
in certain instances  risk of ownership and title passes when the product has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer 
on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions  revenue recognition occurs after the customer has been notified that the products have been completed according to the customer specifications  have passed all of our quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery 
all sales are shown net of returns  discounts and sales incentive programs  which historically have not been significant 
the collectability of any related receivable is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we make certain assumptions regarding the risk of uncollectable open receivable accounts 
this risk factor is applied to the balance on accounts that are aged over days generally this reserve has an estimated range from 
the risk percentage applied to the aged accounts may change based on conditions such as general economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts from year to year 
however  generally our assumptions are consistent year over year and there has been little adjustment made to the percentages used 
in addition  in the event there are certain known risk factors with an open account  we may increase the allowance to include estimated losses on such specific account balances 
the specific reserves are identified by a periodic review of the aged accounts receivable 
if there is an account in question  credit checks are made and there is communication with the customer  along with other means to try to assess if a specific reserve is required 
the inclusion of the specific reserve has caused the greatest fluctuation in our allowance for doubtful accounts balance historically 
please see note  general and summary of accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k and appendix a included in this form k for further details and historical view of our allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with authoritative guidance on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  such assets are tested for impairment at least annually  and written down when and to the extent impaired 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of october of each year  or more frequently if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value 
goodwill is recorded on the financial statements of our utilimaster  crimson fire and classic fire subsidiaries  each considered to be separate reporting units as referred to below 
we early adopted accounting standards update intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu in the fourth quarter of asu permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
under the amendments in asu  we are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount by assessing a range of qualitative factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and current and forecasted financial performance 
if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment permitted by asu  or if  after completing the assessment  it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we perform a two step impairment test  whereby the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by estimating the future cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates  and then discounting the future cash flows at a market participant derived weighted average cost of capital wacc 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  we consider current and projected future levels of income based on our plans for that business  business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions  and market participant considerations 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to not be impaired and the second step of the test is not performed 
the second step of the impairment test is performed when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  in which case the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill based on a hypothetical allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
we evaluate the recoverability of our indefinite lived intangible assets  which consist of our classic fire and utilimaster trade names  by comparing the estimated fair value of the trade name with its carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our trade names based on estimates of future royalty payments that are avoided through our ownership of the trade names  discounted to their present value 
in determining the estimated fair value of the trade name  we consider current and projected future levels of revenue based on our plans for classic fire or utilimaster  business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
significant judgments inherent in these analyses include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  wacc and the amount of expected future net cash flows 
the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the reporting units and trade name 
the goodwill of the specialty vehicles segment of million at december   relates to our crimson and classic fire subsidiaries  which were determined to be reporting units under the guidance of accounting standards codification topic the estimated fair value of crimson exceeded its carrying value by as of october   the most recent annual assessment date 
based on the discounted cash flow valuation at october   an increase in the wacc for the crimson reporting unit of approximately basis points would not result in impairment 
the estimated fair value of classic fire  which was acquired on april   exceeded its carrying value by as of october  we do not consider the small excess of classic fire s fair value over its carrying value to be an indication of likely future goodwill impairment for this reporting unit due to the short time period since its acquisition on april  to the testing date of october  the goodwill of our delivery and service vehicles segment of million at december  related to our utilimaster subsidiary  the sole reporting unit of that segment 
based on the results of our qualitative assessment for utilimaster performed as of october   we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of utilimaster exceeds its carrying value 
accordingly  the goodwill of utilimaster was deemed to be not impaired and no further testing was performed 
the acquired utilimaster trade name has an indefinite life as it is anticipated that it will contribute cash flows to the company indefinitely 
the estimated fair value of our utilimaster trade name exceeded its associated carrying value of million by as of october  the acquired classic fire trade name has an indefinite life as it is anticipated that it will contribute cash flows to the company indefinitely 
the estimated fair value of our classic fire trade name exceeded its associated carrying value of million by as of october  see note  goodwill and intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further details on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the general economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  and other risk factors as detailed in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
warranties our policy is to record a provision for the estimated cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale  and periodically adjust the warranty liability to reflect actual experience 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects actual historical warranty cost  which is accumulated on specific identifiable units 
from that point  there is a projection of the expected future cost of honoring our obligations under the warranty agreements 
historically  the cost of fulfilling our warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts and labor for field retrofit campaigns and recalls  which increase the reserve 
our estimates are based on historical experience  the number of units involved and the extent of features and components included in product models 
over time  this method has been consistently applied and has proven to be an appropriate approach to estimating future costs to be incurred 
see note  commitments and contingent liabilities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding warranties 
new and pending accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
effect of inflation inflation affects us in two principal ways 
first  our revolving note payable is generally tied to the prime and libor interest rates so that increases in those interest rates would be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  we attempt to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of our products 
however  we generally do not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into our contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as nine months  we have limited ability to pass on cost increases to our customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets we serve are competitive in nature  and competition limits our ability to pass through cost increases in many cases 
we strive to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates and the effect of such a change on outstanding variable rate short term and long term debt 
at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our variable rate short term and long term debt agreements 
an increase of in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes 
we do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present our primary risk of loss 
as of the date of this report  we do not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term 
in this discussion  near term means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this report 
prevailing interest rates and interest rate relationships are primarily determined by market factors that are beyond our control 
all information provided in response to this item consists of forward looking statements
