overview we design  manufacture and sell a wide range of medical  surgical and diagnostic devices used by professional healthcare providers for vascular access  for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease and for use in oncology and surgical settings 
our devices are generally used in minimally invasive  image guided procedures 
most of our products are intended to be used once and then discarded  or they may be temporarily implanted for short or long term use 
prior to fiscal  we reported our results of operations as three reportable segments peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery 
at the beginning of fiscal  we combined our peripheral vascular and access reportable segments into a single reportable segment that was named the vascular segment 
the vascular segment  under the direction of a general manager  is responsible for products targeting the venous intervention  dialysis access  thrombus management and peripheral disease markets and has dedicated research and development and sales and marketing personnel assigned to it 
the oncology surgery segment  under the direction of a general manager  is responsible for microwave products  rf ablation  embolization  nanoknife and habib product lines and has dedicated research and development and sales and marketing personnel assigned to it 
our principal competitive advantages are our dedicated market focus  established brands and innovative products 
we believe our dedicated focus enhances patient care and engenders loyalty among our customers 
as a provider of interventional devices for over two decades  we believe we have established angiodynamics brands as premium performance products 
we collaborate frequently with leading interventional physicians in developing our products and rely on these relationships to further support our brands 
for the past five fiscal years  over of our net sales were from single use  disposable products 

table of contents the following table sets forth our aggregate net sales from the following product categories for our last three fiscal years net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollars in thousands peripheral vascular access vascular oncology surgery total we sell our products in the united states through a direct sales force and outside the us through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships 
for fiscal years  and  net sales outside the us were  and  respectively 
our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products  together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products  through internal product development  technology licensing and strategic alliances 
we recognize the importance of  and intend to continue to make investments in  research and development 
for fiscal  and  our research and development r d expenditures were million  million and million  respectively  and constituted  and  respectively  of net sales 
r d expenses include costs to develop new products  enhance existing products  validate new and enhanced products  and manage clinical  regulatory and medical affairs and our intellectual property 
we are also seeking to grow through selective acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in january  we acquired rita medical systems  inc this acquisition created a diversified medical technology company with a broad line of access  diagnostic and therapeutic products that enable interventional physicians and surgeons to treat peripheral vascular disease and cancerous tumors 
interventional oncology is a large and growing area for our existing customer base and rita s leadership position  premium products and excellent reputation fit our strategy 
rita had a very strong position in vascular access ports  which are an ideal sales fit with our morpheus ct picc 
in addition  in may we acquired ablation technology which uses low energy direct current ledc electrical pulses which is complementary to rita s diverse offering of local oncology therapies  including its market leading rfa systems  habib sealer resection devices and lc beads for tumor embolization 
in december  our distribution agreement in connection with lc beads expired 
in june  we completed the acquisition of certain us and uk assets of diomed  inc with this acquisition  we substantially strengthened our position in the market for the treatment of varicose veins 
the combination of diomed endovenous laser products with our existing venous product line provides us with a comprehensive venous product offering 
in january  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of flowmedica  inc providing us with the benephit product line  a therapeutic approach to deliver drugs directly to the kidneys in order to prevent and treat acute kidney injury  in the emerging field of targeted renal therapy 
on march   we established a strategic relationship with microsulis medical ltd  a uk based company specializing in the minimally invasive  microwave ablation technology 
in may  we completed the acquisition of navilyst  providing us with entry into the fluid management business with a market leading product line and significantly enhancing our presence in the vascular access market 
except to the extent we can further use our cash on hand  revolver capacity or equity securities as acquisition capital  we will require additional equity or debt financing to fund any future significant acquisitions 
for fiscal  approximately of our product sales were derived from products manufactured for us by third parties  compared with for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased sales of lc beads  a product which we ceased distributing on december  we intend to manufacture more products in house to lower product costs and increase profitability 

table of contents our ability to increase our profitability will depend in large part on improving gross profit margins 
factors such as changes in our product mix  new technologies and unforeseen price pressures may cause our margins to grow at a slower rate than we have anticipated or to decline 
recent developments acquisition of navilyst on may    we completed the acquisition of privately held navilyst  a global medical device company with strengths in the vascular access  interventional radiology and interventional cardiology markets 
the acquisition and related transaction costs were financed through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock  million in drawn acquisition debt financing and million of cash 
based on the closing price of our stock of on the day prior to the transaction  the purchase price was approximately million 
the fiscal results include approximately million in transaction and related costs for the navilyst acquisition 
these costs are included in acquisition and other items  net in the statement of operations 
with the issuance of the common stock related to the acquisition  as of may  we have approximately million outstanding shares of common stock 
investment funds affiliated with avista capital partners  former owners of navilyst  received approximately million shares of our common stock and as of may  hold approximately of our outstanding shares 
investment funds affiliated with avista capital partners 
entered into a stockholders agreement with us as part of the transaction and also received the right to appoint two additional directors to our existing board of directors 
to satisfy any working capital adjustment and potential indemnification claims that may arise  million of purchase consideration has been placed in escrow  including approximately million in cash and approximately thousand shares of common stock  determined based on the closing price of on the day prior to the transaction 
the indemnification claims period will terminate on july  at may   we have million of receivable related to the working capital adjustment recorded as escrow receivable on the balance sheet 
such receivable is the subject of ongoing negotiation between the parties and there can be no assurance it will be realized 
investment in microsulis medical ltd on march   we established a strategic relationship with microsulis medical ltd  a uk based company specializing in minimally invasive  microwave ablation technology for the coagulation of soft tissue with systems in more than hospitals worldwide 
the relationship includes a million investment in microsulis through the purchase of senior preferred stock  representing a ownership position  exclusive distribution rights to market and sell their microwave ablation systems in all markets outside the united states from may through december  and an exclusive option to purchase at any time until september   substantially all of the global assets of microsulis medical  ltd 
this has been accounted for as a cost method investment 
the million investment is included in intangible assets and other non current assets on the balance sheet at may  fees related to this transaction of approximately thousand are included in acquisition and other items  net in the statement of operations for fiscal regulatory matters on january  we received a warning letter from the us food and drug administration  or fda  in connection with our marketing of the nanoknife system 
in the warning letter the fda states that certain statements we made  including those on our company website  promote the use of the nanoknife system beyond its currently cleared indications 
upon receipt of the warning letter  we promptly responded to fda and completed corrective and preventative actions to address the matters raised 
we believe the matters raised by the fda in the warning letter are fully resolved 

table of contents on may   we received a warning letter from the fda in connection with its inspection of our queensbury  ny manufacturing facility 
in the warning letter  the fda cited deficiencies in the response letter we provided fda pertaining to the inspection that occurred from january through january  the deficiencies related to our internal procedures for medical device reporting  corrections and removals and complaint handling 
we responded to the warning letter and completed corrective and preventive actions to address the observations noted 
on february   we received from the fda a form  list of investigational observations  in connection with its inspection of our queensbury facility from november  through february  the form contained observations related to  among other things  our capa system  mdr reporting  complaint investigation  corrections and removals  acceptance criteria and training 
some of the observations contained in the form were repeat observations from the may  warning letter 
on february   we received from the fda a form in connection with its inspection of our fremont facility from january  through february  the form contained observations related to  among other things  our capa system  design controls  risk management and training 
we have developed a comprehensive quality call to action program to review and augment our quality management systems at our queensbury facility  and we have implemented numerous measures outlined in that plan 
when we initiated the program in early december  we engaged a team of external regulatory and quality experts and reallocated a significant number of engineering and product development resources to support this corporate initiative 
in fiscal  we incurred million in costs associated with the quality call to action program 
we provided responses to fda within business days of our receipt of the from s and we will continue to work closely with fda to resolve any outstanding issues 
until the items raised in the warning letters and during the recent inspections are corrected  we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the fda  including the issuance of warning letters  injunction  seizure or recall of products  imposition of fines or penalties or operating restrictions on our facilities 
such actions could significantly disrupt our ongoing business and operations and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results 
in may  we submitted to fda an application for an investigational device exemption for a clinical trial to study the use of nanoknife in the treatment of pancreatic cancer 
in june  we submitted an amendment to our application to address matters raised by fda in the course of their review of the application and to propose an expanded and enhanced controlled  randomized trial protocol 
in august  we received a disapproval letter from fda requesting additional information and certain protocol changes 
we intend to continue to work with fda to address the matters raised in the august letter 
ceo and executive transitions on june   we entered into a separation agreement with johannes c 
keltjens  our then president and chief executive officer that provided  among other things  for a lump sum payment in the amount of  and continuation of health benefits for a period of up to months 
total expenses of million associated with this separation agreement were included in acquisition and items  net in our statement of operations fiscal joseph m 
devivo commenced employment on september  as president and chief executive officer 
during the transition period  scott j 
solano  senior vice president and chief technology officer  assumed the duties of interim chief executive officer 
mr 
solano resigned from angiodynamics  effective october   expenses of thousand for the relocation of our new ceo and thousand of expenses for transitions in the executive management team are included in acquisition and other items  net in our statement of operations for fiscal executive transition costs of thousand were incurred in fiscal expiration of our distribution agreement amendment for lc bead the supply and distribution agreement with biocompatibles uk limited  which granted us exclusive distribution rights to lc beads in the united states  expired on december  lc bead sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively which represented  and of total sales for each of the fiscal years 

table of contents amendment of angiodynamics stock and incentive award plan on october   we amended the stock and incentive award plan to increase the maximum number of shares of our common stock with respect to which stock options may be granted during any calendar year to any one employee from  shares to  shares 
share repurchase program on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock  prior to may  in fiscal  we purchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
closure of uk facility during the first fiscal quarter of  we made the decision to close our cambridge  uk facility and transfer the production of lasers to our queensbury  ny facility 
we subsequently extended the date for closing the facility and moving laser manufacturing from december to december we estimate the total cost of this project will be approximately million 
the statement of operations for fiscal includes million in associated costs  which is included in acquisition and other items  net 
centros on august   we entered into a distribution  manufacturing and purchase option agreement the agreement with a company to acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and distribute a split tip catheter for the dialysis market we named centros 
the agreement included the option to purchase certain intellectual property associated with these products in the future 
under this agreement  we paid royalties on net sales of the products covered in the agreement 
in accordance with the agreement  we prepaid million of royalties based upon the achievement of certain milestones 
at may   based on lower than anticipated sales results  we reduced the prepaid royalties to net realizable value which resulted in an impairment loss of million recorded in acquisition and other items  net in our fiscal statement of operations 
the remaining balance of  was included in the caption prepaid royalties on the balance sheet as of may   to be credited against future royalties due 
in august  we sold both the tangible and intangible assets associated with the centros product  resulting in a gain of thousand which is included in acquisition and other items  net in the statement of operations for fiscal and the elimination of all related prepaid royalties on the balance sheet as of may  critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all these significant accounting policies affect the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require us to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s authoritative guidance on revenue recognition which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
decisions relative to criterion iii regarding collectability are based upon our judgments  as discussed under 
table of contents accounts receivable below  and should conditions change in the future and cause us to determine this criterion is not met  our results of operations may be affected 
we recognize revenue  net of sales taxes assessed by any governmental authority  as products are shipped  based on fob shipping point terms when title and risk of loss passes to customers 
we negotiate shipping and credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved by us and customers may be subject to a restocking charge 
to be accepted  a returned product must be unadulterated  undamaged and have at least months remaining prior to its expiration date 
we chose to early adopt  effective with the third quarter of fiscal  updated authoritative guidance for revenue recognition relating to the accounting treatment for revenue arrangements that involve more than one deliverable or unit of accounting 
at the same time  we also adopted the updated guidance relating to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
neither of these had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
we write off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible 
for fiscal years  and  our write offs of accounts receivable have been insignificant 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we calculate income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income and capital gains 
where their recovery is not likely  we estimate a valuation allowance and record a corresponding additional tax expense in our statement of operations 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially affected 
as of may   our valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset were approximately million and million  respectively 
we have a total of million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards remaining from acquisitions 
these losses could be significantly limited under internal revenue code irc section our analysis of acquisitions ownership changes as defined in irc section shows that approximately million of remaining federal net operating losses and million of remaining state net operating losses will expire prior to utilization 
the gross deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses reflects this limitation 
in order to ensure the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we need to generate million of taxable income each year for the next seven years  then million of taxable income each year for the following four years and finally  million of taxable income each year for the final eight years of the remaining nineteen year carryforward period 
if we are unable to meet these minimum taxable levels  the deferred tax assets may still be utilized in future years if we can make up previous year taxable income short falls prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwords 
we have determined that we have sufficient existing levels of pre tax earnings to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheets 

table of contents in order to support the realizability of our net deferred tax asset  we projected our pre tax income utilizing a combination of historical and projected results 
utilizing this projected pre tax income  we have projected taxable income taking into consideration existing levels of permanent differences including stock option exercise deductions and non deductible expenses and the reversal of significant temporary differences 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards as of may   after considering irc section limitations  are million 
the expiration of the federal net operating loss carryforwards are as follows million between and  million between and and million between and our state net operating loss carryforwards as of may  after considering remaining irc section limitations are million which expire in various years from to we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and in february which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during fiscal year  new york state completed an examination of our new york state franchise tax returns for fiscal years to in relation to this examination  income tax expense in fiscal includes an out of period benefit of  to correct an error that originated in prior years related to certain state tax credits 
additionally  as a result of the audit  we were able to claim state tax credits of  that are recorded in fiscal year fiscal years through remain open to examination by the various tax authorities 
we analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income taxes  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and we do not anticipate any adjustments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost at standard cost which approximates the first in  first out method or market 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history  and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
in conjunction with the navilyst acquisition  the acquired inventory was stepped up to its net realizable value and will be expensed in cost of goods sold in the statement of operations based on inventory turns 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation  and depreciate these assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we determine this based on our estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
any change in condition that would cause us to change our estimate of the useful lives of a group or class of assets may result in impairment and or significantly affect depreciation expense on a prospective basis 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill and acquired ipr d are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range between one and years  on either a straight line basis over the expected period of benefit or as revenues are earned from the sales of the related products 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
if an intangible asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
acquired ipr d has an indefinite life and is not amortized until completion and development of the project  at which time the ipr d becomes an amortizable asset 
if the related project is not completed in a timely manner or the project is terminated or abandoned  we may have an impairment related to the ipr d  calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
our policy defines ipr d as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
at the time of acquisition  we expect that all acquired ipr d will reach technological feasibility  but there can be no assurance that the commercial viability of these products will actually be achieved 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  and conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
the risks associated with achieving commercialization include  but are not limited to  delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials  delay or failure to obtain required market clearances  or delays or issues with patent issuance  or validity and litigation 
if commercial viability were not achieved  we would likely look to other alternatives to provide these therapies 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but rather  are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we have one intangible asset which has been assigned an indefinite life  the namic trademark  which was recently acquired as part of our acquisition of navilyst and is valued at million 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets have been recorded at either incurred or allocated cost 
allocated costs were based on respective fair market values at the date of acquisition 
we test goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment exists 
the impairment test requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test by reporting unit as of december  at december   our reporting units were the same as our reportable segments 
we determined our reporting units in accordance with fasb accounting guidance 
our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore goodwill in each of the reporting units was not impaired 
the 
table of contents fair value of vascular and oncology surgery exceeded its carrying value by and  respectively 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based upon our stock price plus an estimated control premium of approximately as of december  in addition  as a result of the decision to terminate the lc beads distribution contract in december and our revised expectations of the segment  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test on the oncology surgery segment as of may  significant assumptions included an ebitda exit multiple of to calculate the terminal value of the oncology surgery reporting unit  which was consistent with previous valuations 
in addition  we used a discount rate to calculate the fair value compared to in the december valuation 
our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by and therefore goodwill was not impaired 
even though we determined that there was no goodwill impairment as of december   the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions  loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  would require an interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units prior to the next required annual assessment as of december  it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
events that could  in the future  result in impairment include  but are not limited to  sharply declining sales for a significant product or in a significant geographic region 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
for fiscal  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax 
for fiscal  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax 
for fiscal  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax 
under the provisions of the guidance adopted  we expect to recognize the following future expense for awards granted prior to may  unrecognized compensation cost weighted average remaining vesting period in years stock options non vested stock awards unrecognized compensation cost for stock options is presented net of assumed annual forfeitures 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is 
table of contents distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will vest annually  and we have therefore applied a annual forfeiture rate in determining the stock based compensation charge recorded 
we will re evaluate this estimate periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate on a prospective basis as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that actually vest 
for the fiscal years ended may   may  and may   we used the black scholes option pricing model black scholes as our method of valuation and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of the grant as determined by the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  and a risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we utilize our historical volatility when estimating expected stock price volatility 
we use yield rates on us treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the award to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the expected term is based on our actual historical results 
the dividend yield is based on the history and expectation of dividend payments 
we have not paid dividends in the past nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
our historical data includes information from may   the date of our initial public offering 
results of operations our operating results for fiscal  and are expressed as a percentage of total net sales in the following table 
years ended net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles acquisition and other items  net total operating expenses operating loss income other expenses income interest income interest expense other expense income total other expenses income  net loss income before income tax provision income tax provision net loss income 
table of contents for fiscal  we reported a net loss of million  or loss per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of million  compared with the fiscal results of net income of million  or per diluted common share  on net sales of million 
the fiscal results include among other things  acquisition costs of million  million in ceo and executive transition costs  and million related to the pending closure of the uk facility 
the fiscal results include  in the same line item on the statement of operations  million of impairment charges related to our decision to not continue development of the medron lightport technology and the write down of centros prepaid royalties due to lower than anticipated sales 
the fiscal results reported net income of million  or per diluted common share  on net sales of million 
gross profit was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal fiscal gross margin was reduced by approximately million in product recall costs and approximately million in costs relating to the quality call to action program 
for  and  we were able to use net operating losses nols accumulated by acquired companies to offset the amount of cash we paid for federal and state income taxes 
the cash benefit amounted to approximately million  million and million for the years ended may   may  and may   respectively 
under purchase accounting rules  the use of acquired nols is accounted for in deferred tax assets  therefore  the related cash tax savings is not reflected in our provision for income taxes in the statements of operations 
fiscal years ended may  and may  net sales 
net sales are derived from the sale of our products and related freight charges  less discounts and estimated sales returns and allowances 
net sales for fiscal of million  increased over fiscal sales of the navilyst acquisition contributed million in sales for the ten day period ending may  and lc beads sales decreased by million as a result of the ending distribution of the product on december  from a reportable segment perspective  vascular sales increased to million from million 
the addition of product revenue from the navilyst acquisition for the ten day period ending may  contributed million to the increase in vascular sales 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to venacure evlt products  reflecting strong demand for procedure kits and the recently introduced laser 
oncology surgery sales were million  a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributed to the decrease in lc beads sales described earlier 
nanoknife sales totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal from a geographic perspective  us sales were essentially flat at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  despite the cessation of the distribution of lc beads in december the navilyst acquisition contributed million in us sales 
international sales were million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal increased unit sales of nanoknife products comprised the majority of this increase 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of goods sold  which includes the costs of materials  products purchased from third parties and sold by us  manufacturing personnel  royalties  freight  business insurance  depreciation of property and equipment and other manufacturing overhead 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal compared with for the prior year period 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal was attributable to million in product recall costs and million of costs associated with the quality call to action program  which reduced gross margin by and percentage points  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses include costs to develop new products  enhance existing products  validate new and enhanced products  manage clinical  
table of contents regulatory and medical affairs and our intellectual property 
r d expenses decreased by thousand  or  to million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to the focus of product development resources on the quality call to action program and the resulting classification of those costs in our cost of goods sold

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on investments and financing that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
although we have entered into interest rate swaps with a bank to limit our exposure to interest rate change on our variable interest rate financings  we do not currently engage in any other hedging or market risk management tools 
as part of the navilyst acquisition  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of banks which provided for a million senior secured term loan facility and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the million in proceeds from the term loan were used to finance a portion of the consideration for the acquisition 
the revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes in the future  but were not utilized as of may  both facilities have five year maturities 
the term facility has a quarterly repayment schedule equal to    and of its principal amount in years one through five 
interest on both the term loan and revolving loan will be based on a base rate or eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin which increases as our total leverage ratio increases  and with the base rate and eurodollar rate having ranges of to and to respectively 
in the event of default  the interest rate may be increased by 
the revolving facility will also carry a commitment fee of to per year on the unused portion 
the credit agreement includes  among other standard provisions  two financial covenants 
the first financial covenant requires us to maintain  as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters  a ratio of i consolidated ebitda minus consolidated capital expenditures to ii consolidated interest expense paid or payable in cash plus scheduled principal payments in respect of indebtedness under the credit agreement of not less than to 
the second financial covenant requires us to maintain  as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters  a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of not more than the applicable ratios as set forth in the credit agreement 
nearly all of our sales have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
although not significant  in late fiscal we began to make sales in other currencies  particularly the euro  gb pound and canadian dollar 
approximately of our sales in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro and gb pound 
we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange risk and such risk in the future is expected to be modest 
our excess cash is invested in highly liquid  short term  investment grade securities with maturities primarily of less than two years 
these investments are not held for speculative or trading purposes 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
we hold investments in auction rate securities ars in order to generate higher than typical money market investments 
ars typically are high credit quality  generally achieved with municipal bond insurance 
credit risks are eased by the historical track record of bond insurers  which back a majority of this market 
sell orders for any security traded through an auction process could exceed bids 
such instances are usually the result of a drastic deterioration of issuer credit quality 
should there be a failed auction  we may be unable to liquidate our position in the securities in the near term 
we have million in investments in two auction rate securities issued by new york state and local government authorities that have failed auctions 
the authorities are current in their interest payments on the securities 
we are party to legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business as described in note o
