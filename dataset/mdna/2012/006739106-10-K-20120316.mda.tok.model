item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a comprehensive provider of a broad range of social and medical services in the home focused primarily on the dual eligible population 
our services include personal care and assistance with activities of daily living  skilled nursing and rehabilitative therapies  and adult day care 
our consumers are individuals with special needs who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization  such as the elderly  chronically ill and disabled 
our payor clients include federal  state and local governmental agencies  commercial insurers  and private individuals 
we provide our services through locations across states to over  consumers 
we operate our business through two segments  home community services and home health services 
our home community services are social  or non medical  in nature and include assistance with bathing  grooming  dressing  personal hygiene and medication reminders  and other activities of daily living 
we provide home community services on a long term  continuous basis  with an average duration of approximately months per consumer 
our home health services are primarily medical in nature and include physical  occupational and speech therapy  as well as skilled nursing 
we generally provide home health services on a short term  intermittent or episodic basis to individuals recovering from an acute medical condition  with an average length of care of approximately days 
we utilize a coordinated care model that is designed to enhance consumer outcomes and satisfaction as well as lower the cost of acute care treatment and reduce service duplication 
through our coordinated care model  we utilize our social services to observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of early intervention in the disease process  thereby preventing or reducing the cost of medical services  and or institutionalization 
we also utilize an integrated service delivery model  in selected markets  which maximizes the long term relationship we have with our consumers in our home community segment through on going monitoring and offering our home health services to this same population as their needs warrant 
the model also includes offering home community services to our home health consumers and the referral sources in that segment 
this provides us with diversified sources of revenue  allows our consumers to access both social and medical services from one homecare provider and appeals to referral sources who are seeking a provider with a breadth of services 
in our target markets  our care and service coordinators work with our caregivers  consumers and their medical providers to review our consumers current and anticipated service needs and  based on this continuous review  identify coordination and or integration opportunities 
our ability to grow our net service revenues is closely correlated with the number of consumers to whom we provide our services 
our continued growth depends on our ability to maintain our existing payor client relationships  establish relationships with new payors  enter into new contracts and increase our referral sources 
our continued growth is also dependent upon the authorization by state agencies of new consumers to receive our services 
we believe there are several market opportunities for growth 
the us population of persons aged and older is growing  and the us census bureau estimates that this population will more than double by additionally  we believe the overwhelming majority of individuals in need of care generally prefer to receive care in their homes or community based settings 
finally  we believe the provision of home community services is more cost effective than the provision of similar services in an institutional setting for long term care 

table of contents we have historically grown our business primarily through organic growth  complemented with selective acquisitions 
our home community segment acquisitions have been focused on facilitating entry into new states  whereas our home health segment acquisitions have been focused on complementing our existing home community business  enabling us to provide a more comprehensive range of services in those locations 
acquisitions in the home health segment  while not significant  reflect our goal of being a comprehensive provider of both home community and home health services in the markets in which we operate 
on july   we entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement  pursuant to which we acquired the operations and certain assets of advantage health systems  inc  a south carolina corporation advantage 
advantage is a provider of home community  home health and hospice services in south carolina and georgia  which expanded our services across states 
the total consideration payable pursuant to the purchase agreement was million  comprised of million in cash  common stock consideration with a deemed value of million resulting in the issuance of  common shares  a maximum of million in future cash consideration subject to the achievement of certain performance targets set forth in an earn out agreement and the assumption of certain specified liabilities 
in april  we paid the first earn out payment of million to the sellers of advantage 
during the fourth quarter of we completed a revaluation of the remaining contingent earn out obligation and recorded a reduction of approximately million with a remaining obligation of million as of december  in march  the president signed into law the health reform act 
the health reform act includes several provisions that may affect reimbursement for home health agencies 
the health reform act is broad  sweeping reform  and is subject to change  including through the adoption of related regulations  the way in which its provisions are interpreted and the manner in which it is enforced 
we cannot assure you that the provisions of the health reform act will not adversely impact our business  results of operations or financial position 
we may be unable to mitigate any adverse effects resulting from the health reform act 
on july   the ocr published proposed regulations to implement the hitech act 
failure to comply with hipaa could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us 
recently  the ocr has imposed substantial financial and other penalties on covered entities that improperly disclosed individuals health information 
in november  cms released its final home health pps update 
it included a market basket increase for after application of the mandated reduction and a mandated rate reduction 
the rate reduction resulted from the cms determination that there had been a general increase in case mix that cms believed was unwarranted 
cms believed that this case mix creep was due to improved coding  coding practice changes  and other behavioral responses to the change in reimbursement that went in to effect in  including greater use of high therapy treatment plans above what cms believed was related to an increase in patient acuity 
cms warned that it would continue to monitor changes in case mix 
if new data identifies additional increases in case mix  cms would immediately impose further reductions 
the final payment base rate reflected a decrease from the proposed market basket rate in july cms announced that it was postponing its proposed reduction in home health rates for calendar year pending its further monitoring of case mix changes 
home health agencies that did not submit required quality data would be subject to a reduction in the market basket update 
on august  the president signed into law the budget control act of  which raised the debt ceiling and put into effect a series of actions for deficit reduction 
the budget control act created a congressional joint select committee on deficit reduction that was tasked with proposing additional deficit reduction of at least trillion 
the committee was unsuccessful which triggered automatic across the board reductions in spending of trillion 
medicare is subject to these reductions but medicare reductions are capped at 
as mandated by the health reform act  on october   cms released final regulations for the medicare shared savings program 
although the health reform act mandates that the program be established no later than 
table of contents january   cms set start dates of april  and july  the medicare shared savings program is designed to give financial incentives to healthcare providers and suppliers that meet criteria established by dhhs that work together to manage and coordinate care through acos for fee for service medicare beneficiaries assigned to the aco by cms to increase quality of care and reduce costs 
participating providers and suppliers would share in the savings generated and  in one of two plans  bear the risk of losses 
in proposed regulations published april   cms requested comments on a number of issues including the range of providers and suppliers that could participate in an aco 
reaction to the proposed regulations issued on april  was generally negative especially with regard to start up costs  retroactive assignment of beneficiaries  antitrust issues  the proposed quality measures both the number and complexity  and the lack of a model that only includes shared savings 
the final regulations addressed several but not all of these concerns 
the final regulations set a savings only model where providers share any savings over a threshold amount but do not share any losses  as well as a two sided model where the aco shares in the savings but is also at risk for losses 
the number of quality measures is reduced by almost one half  and beneficiaries are assigned prospectively 
in connection with the aco rules  also on october   the ftc and the doj released a joint antitrust policy statement  the irs released a fact sheet  and the oig released an interim final rule with five fraud waivers waiving prosecution under the anti kickback law  the stark law and the cmpl and laws regarding gain sharing arrangements 
the ftc and the doj antitrust policy statement addressed some but not all antitrust concerns 
the oig waivers set forth who would be protected by the waivers and under what circumstances 
a home health agency cannot qualify for a waiver for activities during aco pre participation  which would include activities in the start up period until an application is accepted but which cms states could also occur during the participation period 
post acute care facilities  such as snfs and irfs  can qualify for pre participation waivers 
without a pre participation waiver  it may be difficult for home health agencies  such as ours  to participate in the planning process for formation of an aco and this may put us at a disadvantage in negotiating sharing of savings if we were to participate in an aco 
in addition  because other post acute care providers  such as snfs and irfs  can participate in the planning process they may more readily participate in acos and may attract referrals that otherwise would have been made to us 
although provider and supplier participation in an aco is voluntary  participation by our competitors in some markets may force us to participate as well  or if we do not participate  result in loss of business 
also  where we do not participate we will need to be mindful of quality measure criteria and if we are unable to meet those criteria we could be at risk for losing medicare referrals 
in addition  other savings programs similar to acos may be adopted by government and commercial payors to control costs and reduce hospital readmissions in which we could be financially at risk 
we cannot predict what affect  if any  acos will have on our company 
on july   dhhs published two sets of proposed regulations relating to health insurance exchanges established under the health reform act providing guidance and options to states on how to structure their exchanges 
on september   dhhs extended the date for public comment from september to october  at this point it is uncertain what services will be mandated for coverage by exchanges or at what level services will be paid or what impact the exchanges will have on other payors 
pursuant to the final home health pps update  cms finalized a reduction to the national standardized day episode rates to account for its perceived nominal case mix growth since the inception of the home health pps through  phasing in the reduction over years 
the reduction in calendar year is and the remaining will be applied for calendar year the effective market basket update for calendar year is resulting from a market basket update of less the required reduction of 
home health agencies that do not meet quality data reporting requirements have a market basket update of 
after applying the reduction  the day episode rate for calendar year is lower than the rate for calendar year cms also implemented several other changes that it had proposed in its notice of proposed rulemaking in july first  cms removed two codes for hypertension from the home health pps case mix model s hypertension group 
second  cms revised payment weights to provide what it believes are more accurate case mix payments  lowering the relative weights for home health episodes with a high number of therapy visits and increasing the weights for episodes with little or no therapy 
the effect is to lower payments for home health episodes with high numbers of therapy visits and increase payments to episodes with little or no therapy 
third  cms increased payments for episodes of care with three to five therapy visits so that these have higher payment to cost ratios and reduced payments for episodes with or just higher than therapy visits so that episodes with approximately therapy visits will have more reasonable payment to cost ratio 
episodes 
table of contents with three to five therapy visits have a higher payment to cost ratio and receive higher payments and episodes of or just over visits have lower cost ratios 
all changes were to be made in a budget neutral way 
cms also reported that for future rulemaking it plans to do further analysis of the costs for providing therapy visits and the use of therapy assistants and plans to make further rate adjustments in accordance with its findings 
for more information  see business government regulation 
segments we operate our business through two segments  home community services and home health services 
we have organized our internal management reports to align with these segment designations 
as such  we have identified two reportable segments  home community and home health  applying the criteria in asc  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the following table presents our locations by segment  setting forth acquisitions  start ups and closures for the period january  to december  home community home health total total at december  acquired start up closed merged total at december  closed merged total at december  as of december   we provided our services through locations across states 
our payor clients are principally federal  state and local governmental agencies 
the federal  state and local programs under which they operate are subject to legislative  budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates 
our commercial insurance carrier payor clients are typically for profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs 
we are seeking to grow our private duty business in both of our segments 
for   and  our payor revenue mix by segment was as follows home community state  local and other governmental programs commercial private duty home health medicare state  local and other governmental programs commercial private duty we also measure the performance of each segment using a number of different metrics 
for our home community segment  we consider billable hours  billable hours per business day  revenues per billable hour and 
table of contents the number of consumers  or census 
for our home health segment  we consider medicare census  non medicare census  medicare admissions and medicare revenues per episode completed 
we derive a significant amount of our net service revenues from our operations in illinois and california  which represented and  and  and and of our total net service revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant amount of our net service revenues are derived from two specific payor clients 
the illinois department on aging  in the home community segment  and medicare  in the home health segment  accounted for and  and  and and of our total net service revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
components of our statements of operations net service revenues we generate net service revenues by providing our home community services and home health services directly to consumers 
we receive payment for providing such services from our payor clients  including federal  state and local governmental agencies  commercial insurers and private individuals 
home community segment revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
our home community segment revenues were generated principally through reimbursements by state  local and other governmental programs which are partially funded by medicaid or medicaid waiver programs  and to a lesser extent from private duty and insurance programs 
net service revenues for our home community segment are principally provided based on authorized hours  determined by the relevant agency  at an hourly rate  which is either contractual or fixed by legislation  and recognized as net service revenues at the time services are rendered 
home health segment revenues are primarily generated on a per episode or visit basis rather than on a flat fee or an hourly basis 
our home health segment revenues are generated principally through reimbursements by the medicare program  and to a lesser extent from medicaid and medicaid waiver programs  commercial insurers and private duty 
net service revenues from home health payors  other than medicare  are readily determinable and recognized as net service revenues at the time the services are rendered 
medicare reimbursements are based on day episodes of care 
the anticipated net service revenues from an episode are initially recognized as accounts receivable and deferred revenues and subsequently amortized as net service revenues ratably over the day episodic period 
at the end of each episode of care  a final claim billing is submitted to medicare and any changes between the initial anticipated net service revenues and final claim billings are recorded as an adjustment to net service revenues 
for open episodes  we estimate net service revenues based on historical data and adjust for the difference between the initial anticipated net service revenues and the ultimate final claim amount 
cost of service revenues we incur direct care wages  payroll taxes and benefit related costs in connection with our employees providing our home community and home health services 
we also provide workers compensation and general liability coverage for these employees 
employees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs 
for home health services  we provide medical supplies and occasionally hire contract labor services to supplement existing staffing in order to meet our consumers needs 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with our segments activities and as part of our central administrative functions 

table of contents our general and administrative expenses for home community and home health services consist principally of supervisory personnel  care coordination and office administration costs 
our general and administrative expenses for home health also include additional staffing for clinical and admissions processing 
these expenses consist principally of wages  payroll taxes and benefit related costs  facility rent  operating costs such as utilities  postage  telephone and office expenses  and bad debt expense 
our corporate general and administrative expenses cover the centralized administrative departments of accounting  information systems  human resources  billing and collections and contract administration  as well as national program coordination efforts for marketing and private duty 
these expenses primarily consist of compensation  including stock based compensation  payroll taxes  and related benefits  legal  accounting and other professional fees  rents and related facility costs  and other operating costs such as software application costs  software implementation costs  travel  general insurance and bank account maintenance fees 
depreciation and amortization expenses we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives  consisting of customer and referral relationships  trade names  trademarks and non compete agreements  principally on accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives 
depreciable assets at the segment level consist principally of furniture and equipment  and for the home community segment  also include vehicles for our adult day centers 
a substantial portion of our capital expenditures is infrastructure related or for our corporate office 
corporate asset purchases consist primarily of network administration and telephone equipment  operating system software  furniture and equipment 
depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight line method over their useful lives or  if less and if applicable  their lease terms 
interest income legislation enacted in illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time 
as the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain  the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption  interest income 
we received approximately million and million in prompt payment interest in and  respectively 
while we may be owed additional prompt payment interest  the amount and timing of receipt of such payments remains uncertain and we have determined that we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income when received 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the first half of included an existing interest rate agreement with a notional value of million that expired on march  this agreement did not qualify as an accounting hedge under asc topic as such  changes in the value of this agreement are reflected in interest expenses in the period of change 
the mark to market adjustment included in interest expense was a decrease of million 
excluding this mark to market adjustment  interest expense decreased million during which was due to a reduction in outstanding debt 
income tax expense all of our income is from domestic sources 
we incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate 
the differences from the federal statutory rate of are principally due to state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits

the increase in our effective tax rate is principally due to the decrease in the benefit provided from our tax credits in proportion to higher pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
at december  and december   we had cash balances of million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our payor clients and the outflow of cash for payroll and payroll taxes  operating expenses  interest and taxes 
due to its revenue deficiencies and financing issues  the state of illinois has reimbursed us on a delayed basis with respect to our various agreements including with our largest payor  the illinois department on aging 
however  the payment amounts received from the state of illinois during resulted in a decrease in the open receivable balance from the state of illinois of million for  from million as of december  to million as of december  
table of contents the state of illinois continues to reimburse us on a delayed basis 
these payment delays have adversely impacted  and may further adversely impact  our liquidity  and may result in the need to increase borrowings under our credit facility 
delayed reimbursements from our other state of illinois payors and deterioration in the aging in the private duty business have also contributed to the increase in our receivables balances 
on march   we entered into the first amendment the first amendment to our credit facility 
the first amendment i increased the maximum aggregate amount of revolving loans available to us by million to million  ii modified our maximum senior debt leverage ratio from to to to for the twelve month period ending march  and each twelve month period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter and iii increased the advance multiple used to determine the amount of the borrowing base from to 
on march   we also amended our subordinated dividend notes that we issued on november  in the aggregate original principal amount of million 
a balance of million was outstanding on the dividend notes as of december  pursuant to the amendments  the dividend notes were amended to i extend the maturity date of the notes from september  to december   ii modify the amortization schedule of the notes to reduce the annual principal payment amounts from million to million in  from million to million in  and provide for total payments in of million and iii permit  based on our leverage ratio  the prepayment of all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes  together with interest on the principal amount 
on july   we entered into a second amendment the second amendment to our credit facility 
the second amendment provided for a million term loan component of the credit facility  the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the purchase price payable in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of advantage effective july  the term loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments  which commenced february interest on the new term loan under the credit facility is payable either at a floating rate equal to the day libor  plus an applicable margin of or the libor rate for term periods of one  two  three or six months plus a margin of 
interest will be paid monthly or at the end of the relevant interest period 
the term loan has a maturity date of january  the total consideration payable pursuant to the purchase agreement was million  comprised of million in cash  common stock consideration with a deemed value of million resulting in the issuance of  common shares  a maximum of million in future cash consideration subject to the achievement of certain performance targets set forth in an earn out agreement and the assumption of certain specified liabilities 
the contingent earn out obligation has been recorded at its fair value of million  which is the present value of our obligation based on probability weighted estimates of the achievement of certain performance targets  as defined 
in april  we paid the first earn out payment of million to the sellers of advantage 
the second earn out payment obligation was reviewed during the fourth quarter of and it was revalued at approximately million as of december  which resulted in a million gain on the revaluation of the contingent consideration 
the final payment is expected to be made during the second quarter of on may   we entered into a joinder  consent and amendment no 
to our credit facility to include addus healthcare delaware inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of addus healthcare  as an additional borrower under our credit facility 
on july   we entered into a fourth amendment the fourth amendment to our credit facility 
the fourth amendment i modified our maximum senior leverage ratio from to to to for each twelve month period ending on the last of day of each fiscal quarter beginning with the twelve month period ended june  and ii increased the advance multiple used to determine the amount of the borrowing base from to to to the fourth amendment resulted in an increase in the available borrowings under our credit facility 
on march   we entered into a fifth amendment the fifth amendment to our credit facility 
the fifth amendment includes technical changes that are intended to comply with rules promulgated by cms that 
table of contents restrict lenders from exercising any rights of set off of funds on deposit in any lockboxes established for receiving payments from governmental authorities 
we have had the benefit of an accommodation from the lenders under the credit facility pursuant to which we were permitted to add back approximately million to adjusted ebitda for the purpose of determining availability under the credit facility 
the effect of the add back was to increase availability by approximately million until march  on march   the add back allowance was reduced by  and will continue to be reduced by  on the first day of each month thereafter until the add back is eliminated  which will result in a reduction in availability of  on the first day of each month thereafter until the add back is eliminated 
as of december  we had million outstanding on our credit facility 
after giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility  approximately million of outstanding letters of credit  borrowing limits based on an advanced multiple of adjusted ebitda and the fourth amendment  we had million available for borrowing under the credit facility as of december  compared to million as of december  while our growth plan is not dependent on the completion of acquisitions  if we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our credit facility  or we are otherwise prohibited from making acquisitions  our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing or unless we obtain the necessary consents from our lenders 
we believe the available borrowings under our credit facility which  when taken together with cash from operations  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs for at least the next months 
cash flows the following table summarizes historical changes in our cash flows for in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the improvement of million for was primarily due to an increase of million in net income after considering non cash reconciliation adjustments and due to million in improvements in working capital accounts 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  compared to million in our investing activities for were million for capital expenditures and a million earn out payment for advantage 
our investing activities in included a million payment relating to the acquisition of advantage  payments of million in contingent consideration made on previously acquired businesses  and million in capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million for compared to net cash used of million in our financing activities for were primarily driven by net payments of million on the revolving credit portion of our credit facility  million in payments on our term loan  payments of million on our dividend notes and net payments of million on all other notes 
our financing activities for were primarily driven by million in borrowings on our term loan which was offset by net payments of million on our revolving credit facility  payments of million on our dividend notes and net payments of million on all other notes 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the improvement in cash provided from operations of million was primarily due to improvements in accounts receivable resulting from an increase in payments received from the state of illinois and our continued focus on cash collections 
the improvement in cash provided from accounts receivable net of reserves was million which resulted from an increase in accounts receivable of million in compared to an increase of million in the improvement in accounts receivable during was partially off set by million of net cash used in operations for accounts payable  accrued expenses  taxes  and prepaid and other assets due to the timing of the related payments 
net cash used in investing activities was million for and million for our investing activities for include cash due at closing of million for the acquisition of advantage  payment of million pursuant to the contingent payment agreement entered into in connection with a acquisition  and million in capital expenditures 
our investing activities for included a payment of million pursuant to the contingent payment agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of addus healthcare  million in contingent consideration payments made on previously acquired businesses  and million in capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million for compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in our financing activities during were primarily driven by borrowings of million under our new term loan  net payments of million on our credit facility  payments of million on our dividend notes and net payments of million on all other notes 
our financing activities for were primarily driven by our ipo that was completed on november  and our credit facility  consisting of a million revolving line of credit 
we used the million net proceeds from our ipo  together with million of initial borrowings under our credit facility to make total payments of million related to the repayment of amounts outstanding under our prior credit facility  to make a payment required by a contingent payment agreement previously entered into with the former owners of addus healthcare  to pay a portion of the dividends accrued on our series a preferred stock that converted into shares of common stock in connection with the offering  to pay a one time consent fee to certain former holders of such shares of series a preferred stock  to pay the former chairman of addus healthcare amounts required by his separation and general release agreement and to pay related fees and expenses 
as of december  we had million outstanding on the credit facility 
outstanding accounts receivable outstanding accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  increased by million as of december  as compared to december  we establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
our provision for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded primarily by aging receivables utilizing eight aging categories and applying our historical collection rates to each aging category  taking into consideration factors that might impact the use of historical collection rates or payor groups  with certain large payors analyzed separately from other payor groups 
in our evaluation of these estimates  we also consider delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues  billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems  resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors 
historically  we have experienced increases in the aging of our accounts receivable resulting from billing delays during the conversion process  either procedural or internal  related to both acquired agencies and transferring our existing home community locations from a legacy system to the centralized mckesson operating system 
reasons for the delays include obtaining approvals from federal and state governmental agencies of provider numbers we acquired with our acquisitions  mckesson payor and billing set up processes 
table of contents and required staff training 
we have also experienced an increase in our home community private duty business  which inherently carries a higher collection risk 
unlike our state  local and other governmental payors  these customers are responsible for their own payment a portion of which may be funded through qualified veteran benefits 
contributing to higher receivable balances are veteran benefits that may take several months to be awarded by the veterans health administration 
our collection procedures include review of account agings and direct contact with our payors 
we have historically not used collection agencies 
an uncollectible amount  not governed by amount or aging  is written off to the allowance account only after reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted 
the following tables detail our accounts receivable before reserves by payor category  showing illinois governmental payors separately  and segment and the related allowance amount at december  and december  december  days days days over days total in thousands  except percentages home community illinois governmental based programs other state  local and other governmental programs private duty and commercial home health medicare other state  local and other governmental programs private duty and commercial illinois governmental based programs total related aging allowance for doubtful accounts reserve as of gross accounts receivable december  days days days over days total in thousands  except percentages home community illinois governmental based programs other state  local and other governmental programs private duty and commercial home health medicare other state  local and other governmental programs private duty and commercial illinois governmental based programs total related aging allowance for doubtful accounts reserve as of gross accounts receivable 
table of contents we calculate our days sales outstanding dso by taking the accounts receivable outstanding net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and deducting deferred revenues at the end of the period  divided by the total net service revenues for the last quarter  multiplied by the number of days in that quarter 
the adjustment for deferred revenues relates to medicare receivables which are recorded at the inception of each day episode of care at the full requested anticipated payment rap amount

indebtedness credit facility our credit facility  most recently amended on march   provides a million revolving line of credit expiring november   and a million term loan maturing january   and includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
substantially all of the subsidiaries of holdings are co borrowers  and holdings has guaranteed the borrowers obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of holdings and the borrowers current and future tangible and intangible assets  including the shares of stock of the borrowers 
the availability of funds under the revolving credit portion of the credit facility  as amended  is based on the lesser of i the product of adjusted ebitda  as defined  for the most recent month period for which financial statements have been delivered under the credit facility agreement multiplied by the specified advance multiple  up to  less the outstanding senior indebtedness and letters of credit  and ii million less the outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit 
interest on the revolving line of credit and term loan amounts outstanding under the credit facility is payable either at a floating rate equal to the day libor  plus an applicable margin of or the libor rate for term periods of one  two  three or six months plus a margin of 
interest on the credit facility will be paid monthly on or at the end of the relevant interest period  as determined in accordance with the credit facility agreement 
the borrowers will pay a fee equal to per annum of the unused portion of the revolving portion of the credit facility 
issued stand by letters of credit will be charged at a rate of per annum payable monthly 
a balance of million was outstanding on our credit facility as of december  and the total availability under the revolving credit loan facility was million at december  the credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants regarding  among other things  the maintenance of records  compliance with laws  maintenance of permits  maintenance of insurance and property and payment of taxes 
the credit facility also contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that  among other things  include a requirement to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a requirement to stay below a maximum senior leverage ratio and a requirement to stay below a maximum permitted amount of capital expenditures  as well as restrictions on guarantees  indebtedness  liens  dividends  distributions  investments and loans  subject to customary carve outs  restrictions on holdings and the borrowers ability to enter into transactions other than in the ordinary course of business  a restriction on the ability to consummate more than three acquisitions in any calendar year  or for the purchase price of any one acquisition to exceed million  in each case without the consent of the lenders  restrictions on mergers  transfers of assets  acquisitions  equipment  subsidiaries and affiliate transactions  subject to customary carve outs  and restrictions on fundamental changes and lines of business 
we were in compliance with all of our credit facility covenants at december  we have had the benefit of an accommodation from the lenders under the credit facility pursuant to which we were permitted to add back approximately million to adjusted ebitda for the purpose of determining availability under the credit facility 
the effect of the add back was to increase availability by approximately million until march  on march   the add back allowance was reduced by  and will continue to be reduced by  on the first day of each month thereafter until the add back is eliminated  which will result in a reduction in availability of  on the first day of each month thereafter until the add back is eliminated 

table of contents dividend notes prior to the completion of our ipo  we had  shares of series a preferred stock issued and outstanding  all of which were converted into shares of our common stock on november  shares of our series a preferred stock accumulated dividends each quarter at a rate of  compounded annually 
we accrued these undeclared dividends because the holders had the option to convert their shares of series a preferred stock into common stock at any time with the accumulated dividends payable in cash or a note payable 
our series a preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock in connection with the completion of our ipo on november  we paid million of the million outstanding accumulated dividends as of november  with the remaining million being converted into junior subordinated promissory notes  which we refer to as the dividend notes 
the dividends notes are subordinated and junior to all obligations under our credit facility 
on march   we amended our subordinated dividend notes 
pursuant to the amendments  the dividend notes were amended to i extend the maturity date of the dividend notes from september  to december   ii modify the amortization schedule of the dividend notes to reduce the annual principal payment amounts from million to million in  from million to million in  and to provide for total payments in to million  and iii permit  based on our leverage ratio  the prepayment of all or a portion of the principal amount of the dividend notes  together with interest on the principal amount 
a balance of million was outstanding on the dividend notes as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet guarantees or arrangements with unconsolidated entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expense and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other sources and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider the items discussed below to be critical because of their impact on operations and their application requires our judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition the majority of our home community segment revenues for and  are derived from medicaid and medicaid waiver programs under agreements with various state and local authorities 
these agreements provide for a service term from one year to an indefinite term 
services are provided based on authorized hours  determined by the relevant state or local agency  at an hourly rate specified in the agreement or fixed by legislation 
services to other payors  such as private or commercial clients  are provided at negotiated hourly rates and recognized in net service revenues as services are provided 
we provide for appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts at the time the services are rendered 
more than half of our home health segment revenues are derived from medicare 
home health services are reimbursed by medicare based on episodes of care 
under pps  an episode of care is defined as a length of care up to days per patient with multiple continuous episodes allowed 
billings per episode under pps vary based on the severity of the patient s condition and are subject to adjustment  both higher and lower  for changes in the patient s medical condition and certain other reasons 
at the inception of each episode of care  we submit a 
table of contents request for anticipated payment  or rap  to medicare for to of the estimated pps reimbursement 
we estimate the net pps revenues to be earned during an episode of care based on the initial rap billing  historical trends and other known factors 
the net pps revenues are initially recognized as deferred net service revenues and subsequently amortized as net service revenues ratably over the day episodic period 
at the end of each episode of care  a final claim billing is submitted to medicare and any changes between the initial rap and final claim billings are recorded as an adjustment to net service revenues 
for open episodes  we estimate net revenues based on historical data  and adjust net service revenues for the difference  if any  between the initial rap and ultimate final claim amount 
we did not record any significant adjustments of prior period net pps estimates 
the remaining revenues in our home health segment are from state and local governmental agencies  commercial insurers and private individuals 
services are primarily provided to these payors on a per visit basis based on negotiated rates 
as such  net service revenues are readily determinable and recognized at the time the services are rendered 
we provide for appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts at the time the services are rendered 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we are paid for our services primarily by state and local agencies under medicaid or medicaid waiver programs  medicare  commercial insurance companies and private individuals 
while our accounts receivable are uncollateralized  our credit risk is somewhat limited due to the significance of medicare and state agency payors to our results of operations 
laws and regulations governing the medicaid and medicare programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
amounts collected may be different than amounts billed due to client eligibility issues  insufficient or incomplete documentation  services at levels other than authorized and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
legislation enacted in illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time 
as the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain  the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption  interest income 
we received approximately million and million in prompt payment interest in and  respectively 
while we may be owed additional prompt payment interest  the amount and timing of receipt of such payments remains uncertain and we have determined that we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income when received 
we establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded primarily by aging receivables utilizing eight aging categories and applying our historical collection rates to each aging category  taking into consideration factors that might impact the use of historical collection rates or payor groups  with certain large payors analyzed separately from other payor groups 
in our evaluation of these estimates  we also consider delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues  billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems  resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors 
historically  we have not experienced any write off of accounts as a result of a state operating with budget deficits 
while we regularly monitor state budget and funding developments for the states in which we operate  we consider losses due to state credit risk on outstanding balances as remote 
we believe that our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover potential losses  however  actual collections in subsequent periods may require changes to our estimates 
goodwill our carrying value of goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions including the acquisition of addus healthcare 
in accordance with asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
table of contents are not amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  as of october  or whenever potential impairment triggers occur  such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually using a two step method 
the first step in the evaluation of goodwill impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to the recorded value  including goodwill 
we use the combination of a discounted cash flow model dcf model and the market multiple analysis method to determine the current fair value of each reporting unit 
the dcf model was prepared using revenue and expense projections based on our current operating plan 
as such  a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast revenue growth  price changes  gross profits  operating expenses and operating cash flows 
the cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of  which was management s best estimate based on our capital structure and external industry data 
as part of the second step of this evaluation  if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
in light of the current federal and state economic and reimbursement environments and state budgetary pressures to decrease or eliminate services provided by us  we completed a preliminary assessment of the fair value of our two reporting units  home community and home health and the potential for goodwill impairment as of june  our total stockholders equity as of september  was significantly greater than the company s market capitalization which was approximately million based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of september  while the market capitalization of approximately million was below our stockholders equity  the market capitalization metric is only one indicator of fair value 
in our opinion  the market capitalization approach  by itself  is not a reliable indicator of the value for our company 
based on the above factors and updates to our business projections and forecasts  and other factors  we determined that the estimated fair value of our home health reporting unit was less than the net book value indicating that its allocated goodwill was impaired 
the preliminary assessment for our home community reportable unit indicated that its fair value was greater than its net book value with no initial indication of goodwill impairment 
as permitted by asc topic  when an impairment indicator arises toward the end of an interim reporting period  we may recognize our best estimate of that impairment loss 
based on our preliminary analysis prepared as of june   we determined that all of the million allocated to goodwill for the home health reportable unit as of september  was impaired and we recorded a goodwill impairment loss in the third quarter of the goodwill impairment charge is noncash in nature and does not affect our liquidity or cash flows from operating activities 
additionally  the goodwill impairment had no effect on our borrowing availability or covenants under our credit facility agreement 
the preliminary analysis prepared as of june  was subject to the completion of our annual impairment test as of october  we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  and determined that no additional impairment charges or adjustments were required 
the goodwill for the company s two reporting units  home community and home health was million and  respectively 
home community had fair values in excess of carrying amounts of approximately million  or as of october  long lived assets we review our long lived assets and finite lived intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
to determine if impairment exists  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the related long lived assets to the net carrying amount of such assets 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset  generally determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows 
in connection with our assessment of fair value discussed above  we determined that all of the million allocated to home health finite lived intangibles were impaired and recorded an impairment loss of million in the third quarter of 
table of contents we also have indefinite lived assets that are not subject to amortization expense such as certificates of need and licenses to conduct specific operations within geographic markets 
our management has concluded that certificates of need and licenses have indefinite lives  as management has determined that there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  economic or other factors that would limit the useful life of these intangible assets and we intend to renew and operate the certificates of need and licenses indefinitely 
the certificates of need and licenses are tested annually for impairment 
in connection with our assessment of fair value discussed above  we determined that all of the million allocated to home health certificates of need and licenses were impaired and recorded an impairment loss for no impairment charges were recorded in workers compensation program our workers compensation insurance program has a  deductible component 
we recognize our obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred 
the cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported  up to the deductible  have been accrued based on historical claims experience  industry statistics and an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party 
we monitor our claims quarterly and adjust our reserves accordingly 
these costs are recorded primarily in the cost of services caption in the consolidated statement of income 
under the agreement pursuant to which we acquired addus healthcare  claims under our workers compensation insurance program that relate to december  or earlier are the responsibility of the selling shareholders in the acquisition  subject to certain limitations 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  health care entities topic  presentation of insurance claims and related insurance recoveries asu  which clarifies that companies should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability 
additionally  the amount of the claim liability should be determined without consideration of insurance recoveries 
as of december   we recorded million in workers compensation insurance recovery receivables and a corresponding increase in its workers compensation liability as of december  we will record this new presentation of our workers compensation insurance recovery receivable and corresponding obligation on a prospective basis 
the workers compensation insurance recovery receivable is included in our prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet 
interest income legislation enacted in illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time 
as the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain  the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption  interest income 
we received approximately million and million in prompt payment interest in and  respectively 
while we may be owed additional prompt payment interest  the amount and timing of receipt of such payments remains uncertain and we have determined that we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income when received 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic which will amend current guidance to allow companies to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
asu is effective beginning january   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  health care entities topic presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue  provision for bad debts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts for certain 
table of contents health care entities 
under asu  only health care organizations hcos that do not assess the collectability of a receivable before recognizing revenue will present their provision for bad debt related to patient service revenue as a deduction from revenue on the face of the statement of operations 
asu also requires and expands qualitative and quantitative disclosures about changes in the allowance 
for certain hcos  the guidance may result in the provision for bad debts being presented in two separate lines  a contra revenue line for bad debts related to patient services and a bad debts line for bad debts related to all other sources of income 
asu is effective in the first quarter of the amendments to the presentation of the provision for bad debts related to patient service revenue in the statement of operations are applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented  while required disclosures are provided prospectively 
we are still evaluating the provisions of asu however  the adoption of this standard will not impact net income and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  health care entities topic presentation of insurance claims and related insurance recoveries which clarifies for medical malpractice claims or similar contingent liabilities  a health care entity should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability 
the amendments in the this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments we have outstanding letters of credit of million at december  these standby letters of credit benefit our third party insurer for our high deductible workers compensation insurance program 
the amount of letters of credit is negotiated annually in conjunction with the insurance renewals

impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates
