at the beginning of fiscal year  the company operated a second business segment  which consisted of grill buffet style golden corral restaurants that were licensed to the company by golden corral corporation 
the company closed six of the golden corral restaurants in august due to under performance  which resulted in a pretax charge of  for impairment of long lived assets that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year in may  the company sold the remaining restaurants to golden corral corporation for million before closing adjustments  which resulted in a pretax loss of  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year results for the golden corral segment are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the financial statements and segment information is no longer reported

income tax expense included in net earnings for fiscal year is an income tax benefit of  which is the result of applying available tax credits principally federal credits allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the work opportunity tax credit that will be realized on the fiscal year s tax return against a very low level of pretax earnings for the year

results of operations except as where noted  the discussion of results of operations presented in this md a excludes the results from discontinued operations 
sales the company s sales are primarily generated through the operation of frisch s big boy restaurants 
sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to frisch s big boy restaurants licensed to other operators and the sale of frisch s signature brand tartar sauce to grocery stores 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases 
changes in sales also occur as new restaurants are opened and older restaurants are closed 
below is the detail of consolidated sales

another increase is currently being planned for implementation in the first quarter of fiscal year september 
customer counts in same stores were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year while higher menu prices may contribute to the overall trend in lower customer traffic  management believes larger factors are the persistently high unemployment rate in the midwest and the continuation of high gasoline prices  which continue to restrict the disposable income of the customer base  which in turn limits sales growth opportunities

the payment card industry security standards council pci has a data security standard with which all organizations that process card payments must comply 
the standard is intended to prevent credit card fraud by focusing on the internal controls of processing and storing such data 
pci requires an annual audit to certify the company s compliance with the required internal controls 
the 
table of contents company received its attestations of compliance in june and again in june a finding of non compliance could have restricted the company s ability to continue accepting credit and debit cards as a form of payment 
a plan is currently under development to significantly expand the company s grocery line business by adding frisch s brand of salad dressings in grocery stores  joining frisch s brand tartar sauce  which has been a long standing staple on grocery store shelves in ohio  kentucky and indiana 
the deletion of the reference to big boy will allow the frisch s brand to enter previously restricted markets 
gross profit the determination of gross profit is shown with operating percentages in the following table 
the table is intended to supplement the cost of sales discussion that follows 
cost of sales is comprised of food and paper costs  payroll and related costs  and other operating costs 
fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit food prices continued to sharply escalate in fiscal year higher prices were paid for most commodities  especially beef and pork 
hamburger and bacon have the greatest consumption of all items in the menu mix 
the price of hamburger continues at record highs driven by a the high cost of corn  which is the primary feed ingredient for cattle  hogs and poultry  and b record low beef supplies and strong demand for exports 
the cost for beef and other commodities is expected to continue rising  especially given the drought conditions in the nation s corn belt 
although the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity prices  purchase contracts for some commodities may contain provisions that limit the price the company will pay 
in addition  the effect of commodity price increases is actively managed with changes to the menu mix  together with periodic increases in menu prices 
however  rapid escalations in the cost of food can be problematic to effective menu management  as evidenced by the rising percentages in the above table despite higher prices being charged to customers 
food safety poses a major risk to the company 
management rigorously emphasizes and enforces established food safety policies in all of the company s restaurants and in its commissary and food manufacturing plant 
these policies are designed to work cooperatively with programs established by health agencies at all levels of governmental authority  including the federal hazard analysis of critical control points haccp program 
in addition  the company makes use of servsafe training  a nationally recognized program developed by the national restaurant association 
the servsafe program provides accurate  up to date science based information to all levels of restaurant workers on all aspects of food handling  from receiving and storing to preparing and serving 
all restaurant managers are required to be certified in servsafe training and are required to be re certified every five years 
the across the board decreases in payroll and related costs as a percentage of sales shown in the above table were driven primarily by the combination of higher menu prices charged to customers and a reduction in labor hours commensurate with lower customer counts 
in fiscal year  payroll and related costs received the benefit from the federal hiring incentives to restore employment act of hire act  enacted march under which the company did not have to pay the employer s share of social security fica taxes on certain new hires 
fica credits under the hire act amounted to  during fiscal year notwithstanding the improvements shown in payroll and related cost percentages in the above table  payroll and related costs continue to be adversely affected by mandated increases in the minimum wage in ohio  where more than two thirds of the company s payroll costs are incurred  the minimum wage for non tipped employees was increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was subsequently increased to per hour on january   to per hour on january  there was no increase on january  and to per hour on january  on january   the rate increased to per hour  which represents a percent increase over the five year period 
the ohio minimum wage for tipped employees increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was subsequently increased to per hour on january   to per hour on january  there was no increase on january  and to per hour on january  on january   the rate increased to 
table of contents per hour  which represents an percent increase over the five year period 
federal minimum wage statutes currently apply to substantially all other non ohio employees 
the federal minimum wage for non tipped employees increased from per hour to per hour in july it was increased to per hour in july and to per hour in july the rate for tipped employees non ohio was not affected by the federal legislation  remaining at per hour 
although there is no seasonal fluctuation in employment levels  the number of hours worked by hourly paid employees has always been managed closely according to sales patterns in individual restaurants 
however  the effects of paying the mandated higher hourly rates of pay have been and are continuing to be countered through the combination of reductions in the number of scheduled labor hours and higher menu prices charged to customers 
without benefit of reductions in labor hours  the ohio minimum wage increase on january  would add an estimated  to annual payroll costs in ohio restaurant operations 
despite the savings that come from reductions in hours worked and higher menu prices charged to customers  other factors add to payroll and related costs 
these factors include higher costs associated with benefit programs offered by the company  including medical insurance premiums and pension related costs 
medical insurance premiums for the calendar plan year are projected to be approximately  which is percent higher than the previous year and percent higher than two years ago 
the company has typically absorbed percent of the cost for medical premiums  with employees contributing the remaining percent 
as costs continue to escalate  it is likely that employees will be asked to contribute a greater percentage in the future 
management continues to analyze and evaluate health care reform legislation the federal patient protection and affordable care act  enacted march to determine the future short and long term effects upon the company  while developing various strategies to mitigate the expected financial burden 
net periodic pension cost including amounts charged to discontinued operations was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and net periodic pension expense for fiscal year included a benefit in excess of  from changes in assumptions relating to retirement  termination and marriage 
fiscal year s net periodic pension cost also included the effect of a curtailment credit of  from the termination of golden corral employees 
settlement losses of  and  were included in the net periodic pension costs respectively for fiscal years and no settlement losses were incurred in fiscal year settlement losses are triggered when the sum of all settlements lump sum cash outs exceed interest and service cost 
no settlement losses are expected in fiscal year the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was percent in fiscal year and  which was lowered from percent in fiscal year the assumption will remain at percent for the determination of pension costs for fiscal year the discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions to compute pension costs was percent in fiscal year  which was lowered from percent in fiscal year and from percent in fiscal year the rate for fiscal year will be lowered to percent 
net periodic pension cost will increase by approximately  for each decrease of basis points in the discount rate 
the rate of compensation increase used to calculate pension costs was percent in fiscal years  and  it will remain at percent for fiscal year net periodic pension cost for fiscal year is currently estimated at approximately  the primary drivers of the higher projected expense are a the lower discount rate and a negative return on plan assets that was experienced in fiscal year contributions made to company sponsored plans were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and contributions for fiscal year are currently anticipated to be at least  which includes amounts to meet minimum legal funding requirements and potential discretionary contributions 
future funding of the pension plans largely depends upon the performance of investments that are held in trusts that have been established for the plans 
equity securities comprise percent of the target allocation of the plans assets 
the fair value of all plan assets was   and  respectively at the end of fiscal years  and although equity markets have made significant rebounds since when market declines lowered the fair value of plan assets to  from  at the end of the previous year  funding requirements continue to be adversely affected and combined with low bond rates will likely require the continued recognition of significantly higher net periodic pension costs than had been incurred prior to pension accounting standards require the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans to be recognized as an asset or liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and projected benefit obligations pbo 
underfunded status at may  increased to  fair value of plan assets  versus pbo of  up from  fair value of plan assets  versus pbo of  at may  the pbo at may  includes former golden corral employees measured at accumulated benefit obligation no projections for future salary increases or additional years of credited service 
the increase in the pbo at may  is the result of a decrease in the fair value of plan assets and the lowering of the discount rate to percent from 
table of contents percent at may  each decrement of basis points in the discount rate increases pbo by an estimated  the company s equity was decreased  net of tax  at may  to establish underfunded status at  the decrease in equity was effected through a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
equity was increased  net of tax  to establish underfunded status of  at may   which was effected through a credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its ohio workers compensation program 
initial self insurance reserves are accrued based on prior claims history  including an amount developed for incurred but unreported claims 
active management of claims  which includes a requirement for post accident drug testing  keeps the number of claims and the average cost per claim to a minimum 
payroll and related costs are also affected by adjustments that result each quarter when management performs a comprehensive review of claims experience in the company s self insured ohio workers compensation program 
increases to the self insured reserves result in charges to payroll and related costs  while decreases to the reserves result in credits to payroll and related costs 
the reserves were increased charged against payroll and related costs by   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  abandonment losses  property tax  insurance and utilities  plus costs relating to field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  new restaurant opening costs  and many other restaurant operating costs 
opening costs can have a significant effect on the operating costs 
opening costs in fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
as most of the other typical expenses charged to other operating costs tend to be more fixed in nature  the percentages shown in the above table can be greatly affected by changes in same store sales levels 
in other words  percentages will generally rise when sales decrease and percentages will generally decrease when sales increase 
operating profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit  administrative and advertising expense is subtracted from gross profit  while the line item for franchise fees and other revenue is added to it 
gains and losses from the sale of real property if any are then respectively added or subtracted 
charges for impairment of assets if any are also subtracted from gross profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit 
administrative and advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and advertising expense represents the largest component of these costs 
advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and spending for advertising and marketing programs is proportionate to sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of sales on advertising and marketing 
all other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and the chief executive officer s ceo incentive compensation was included in other administrative costs as follows zero   and  respectively was accrued in fiscal years  and stock based compensation costs included in other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and stock based compensation cost for fiscal year included  for an unrestricted stock award to the ceo 
the unrestricted stock award was granted in exchange for the ceo s termination of an option to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
revenue from franchise fees is based upon sales volumes generated by frisch s big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales and are recorded on the accrual method as earned 
as of may   frisch s big boy restaurants were licensed to other operators and paying franchise fees to the company 
no new licensed big boy restaurants opened during any of the periods presented in this md a  one closed during fiscal year other revenue also includes certain other fees earned from frisch s big boy restaurants licensed to others along with minor amounts of rent and investment income 
gains and losses from the sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that routinely arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life  abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 
gains from sales of real property in fiscal year amounted to  primarily from the february sale of a former frisch s big boy restaurant 
sales proceeds in fiscal year were  losses from sales involving real property in fiscal year amounted to  primarily from the march sale of certain surplus property 
total sale proceeds in fiscal year were  no sales of real property occurred during fiscal year one under performing frisch s big boy restaurant owned in fee simple was permanently closed near the end of fiscal year  
table of contents which resulted in a non cash pretax impairment charge of  to lower its carrying value to estimated fair value 
in addition  the continuation of soft market conditions resulted in a non cash pretax impairment charge totaling  to lower the previous estimates of the fair values of two former frisch s big boy restaurants that have been held for sale for several years 
no charges for impairment of assets were recorded during fiscal years or interest expense interest expense was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the decreases are primarily the result of lower debt levels 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
these credits are generally more favorable to the effective tax rate when pretax earnings decrease 
the wotc expired december  in addition  fiscal year includes a tax benefit of  in connection with a net operating loss in the state of kentucky  which arose because the company will begin reporting taxable income using the mandatory nexus consolidated filing method 
the company believes it has no uncertain tax positions that have been filed or that are expected to be taken on a future tax return 
the internal revenue service completed its examination of the company s tax return for fiscal year in november the examination resulted in no changes 
discontinued operations on may   the company closed on the sale of its golden corral restaurant operations to golden corral corporation  from which the company had previously been granted licenses to operate the restaurants that comprised the assets that were sold in the transaction 
the company recorded a pretax loss on the sale of   in the fourth quarter during the year ended may  the company had previously closed six under preforming golden corral restaurants in august  which resulted in a non cash pretax asset impairment charge with related closing costs of  that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year ended september  
the impairment charge lowered the carrying values of the six restaurant properties to their estimated fair values 
additional non cash pretax impairment charges of  were subsequently recorded during fiscal year  in the third quarter ended march  based on a contract that was accepted for less than the original estimate of fair value  and  in the fourth quarter to reflect revised opinions of value from real estate brokers

the funds from sales are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in currency or are settled by debit or credit cards 
the primary source of cash provided by operating activities is net earnings plus depreciation and impairment of assets  if any 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against credit lines  proceeds received when stock options are exercised and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion  capital stock repurchases and dividends 
proceeds from the may sale of the company s golden corral restaurants amounted to million before closing adjustments 
as of may    had been invested in commercial paper with original maturities of days or less 
in addition  the sum of  from the proceeds was being held by a third party intermediary in anticipation of the completion of qualifying like kind exchanges in order to defer taxable gains pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
working capital practices the company s working capital was  as of may  a working capital deficit of  existed as of may  the improvement is directly attributable to the cash equivalents that were on hand at may  from the sale of the golden corral restaurants in may aside from the may sale of the golden corral restaurants  the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  which is a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations and credit lines remain readily available  this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table

operating activities net cash provided by continuing operations was  in fiscal year  which compares with  in fiscal year and  fiscal year changes in assets and liabilities such as prepaid expenses  inventories  accounts payable and accrued  prepaid and deferred income taxes  all of which can and often do fluctuate widely from year to year  account for most of the changes 
management has measured cash flows from continuing operations by simply adding back certain non cash expenses to earnings from continuing operations 
these non cash expenses include items such as depreciation  losses net of any gains on dispositions of assets  charges for impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation costs and pension costs in excess of plan contributions 
the result of this approach is shown as a sub total in the consolidated statement of cash flows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year an automatic change in accounting method was filed with the internal revenue service irs in fiscal year  to allow immediate deduction of certain repairs and maintenance costs  replacing the previous treatment that had capitalized these costs 
in december  the irs issued new temporary and proposed regulations on tangible property that significantly departs from the prior proposed regulations on which the company s change in accounting method was based 
management is currently reviewing the new temporary and proposed regulations to determine the effect  if any  upon the company s change in accounting method  which would have to be applied beginning in fiscal year net cash provided by discontinued operations in fiscal year was determined as follows normal changes in assets and liabilities plus certain non cash expenses  such as depreciation  the loss on the sale of restaurants net of the gain on the sale of other properties  and charges for the impairment of long lived assets  were added back to the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
the same basic formula was used for fiscal years and investing activities capital spending is normally the principal component of the company s investing activities 
capital spending was

net cash used in discontinued investing activities in prior years was principally for capital spending  which was mostly for remodel jobs and routine equipment replacements 
financing activities borrowing against credit lines amounted to  during fiscal year scheduled and other payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  during fiscal year regular quarterly cash dividends to shareholders amounted to  in fiscal year  or per share 
the dividend per share was in fiscal year and in fiscal year a per share quarterly dividend was declared on june  its payment on july  was the th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the company

vested shares must be held until board service or employment ends  except that enough shares may be sold to satisfy tax obligations attributable to the grants 
all unrestricted and restricted shares were awarded under the stock option and incentive plan plan 
as of may    shares remained available for awards under the plan 
the fair value of stock options granted and restricted stock issued is recognized as compensation cost on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards 
although no stock options were granted during fiscal year  compensation cost continues from the run out of options granted in previous years 
compensation cost from restricted shares issued as shown in the table below includes costs from the run out of awards granted in october to non employee members of the board of directors 
the fair value of unrestricted stock issued to the ceo in june was recognized entirely during the first quarter of fiscal year  which ended september  compensation costs arising from all share based payments are charged to administrative and advertising expense in the consolidated statement of earnings

most of these were acquired in june when  shares valued at  were surrendered by the ceo to cover the tax obligation on his unrestricted stock award 
other information the company opened two new frisch s big boy restaurants during fiscal year the first opened in july on land that was acquired in fee simple estate during fiscal year the second one opened in october on ground that is leased to the company 
it replaced an older nearby restaurant 
one new restaurant was under construction as of may   which is scheduled to open in august several other sites owned by the company including two that were acquired in fiscal year have been land banked for possible future development 
including land and land improvements  the cost required to build and equip each new frisch s big boy restaurant currently ranges from  to  the actual cost depends greatly on the price paid for the land and the cost of land improvements  both of which can vary widely from location to location  and whether the land is purchased or leased 
costs also depend on whether the new restaurant is constructed using plans for the original building prototype  square feet with seating for guests or its smaller adaptation  the building prototype  square feet with seating for guests  which is used in smaller trade areas 
the larger building prototype plan was used to construct both of the new restaurants that opened during fiscal year the smaller building prototype is being used to build the restaurant that was under construction as of may  approximately one fifth of the restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year 
the renovations not only refresh and upgrade interior finishes  but are also designed to synchronize the interiors and exteriors of older restaurants with that of newly constructed restaurants 
the current average cost to renovate a restaurant ranges from  to  the fiscal year remodeling budget is  for planned remodel jobs 
certain high volume restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies and whether an expansion of the dining room is warranted 
although there are currently no such plans in fiscal year  a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  and a dining room expansion can cost up to  part of the company s strategic plan entails owning the land on which it builds new restaurants 
however  it is sometimes necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
five restaurants that have opened since  including one during fiscal year  were built on leased land 
as of may   restaurants were operating on non owned premises  of which are being accounted for as operating leases with one treated as a capital lease 
two restaurants that operated on leased land were permanently closed when their leases expired during fiscal year the company remains contingently liable under certain ground lease agreements relating to land on which seven of the company s former golden corral restaurants are situated 
the seven leases were assigned to golden corral corporation gcc as part of the transaction to sell the restaurants to gcc 
the amount remaining under contingent lease obligations totaled  as of may   for which the aggregate average annual lease payments approximate  in each of the next five years 
since there is no reason to believe that gcc is likely to default  no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for amounts that would be payable by the company 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management believes the following to be the company s critical accounting policies 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  management reviews claims valued by the third party administrator tpa of the program and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  management reviews it in light of historical claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement  and any other facts that might provide guidance in determining ultimate value of individual claims 
unexpected changes in any of these or other factors could result in actual costs differing materially from initial projections or values presently carried in the self insurance reserves 
pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term investment return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
a committee consisting of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
to determine the long term rate of return on plan assets  the committee considers a weighted average of the historical broad market return and the forward looking expected return 
the historical broad market return assumes a wide period of data available for each asset class 
domestic equity securities are allocated equally between large cap and small cap funds  with fixed income securities allocated equally between long term corporate government bonds and intermediate term government bonds 
the model for the forward looking expected return uses a range of expected outcomes over a number of years based on the mix of the plan assets and assumptions about the return  variance  and co variance for each asset class 
the weighted average of the historical broad market return and the forward looking expected return is rounded to the nearest basis points to determine the overall expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate is selected by matching the cash flows of the pension plan to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the selection of the discount rate represents the equivalent single rate under a broad market aa yield curve 
the yield curve is used to set the discount rate assumption using cash flows on an aggregate basis  which is then rounded to the nearest basis points 
pension plan assets are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
poor performance in equity securities markets can significantly lower the market values of the investment portfolios  which  in turn  can result in a material increases in future funding requirements  b much higher net periodic pension costs to be recognized in future years  and c increases in underfunded plan status  requiring the company s equity to be reduced 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
capitalization policies are continually monitored to assure they remain appropriate 
management considers a history of cash flow losses on a restaurant by restaurant basis to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
carrying values of property and equipment are tested for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property 
when undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than carrying values  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which carrying values exceed fair value  which is determined as either the greater of the net present value of the future cash flow stream  or by opinions of value provided by real estate 
table of contents brokers and or management s judgment as developed through its experience in disposing of unprofitable restaurant operations 
broker opinions of value and the judgment of management consider various factors in their fair value estimates such as the sales of comparable area properties  general economic conditions in the area  physical condition and location of the subject property  and general real estate activity in the area  among other factors 
future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may influence operating performance  which affect cash flows 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor operating performance 
the ultimate loss can be significantly different from the original impairment charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from estimated fair values 
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of its debt is currently financed with fixed interest rates  or will be converted to fixed rate term loans in the next six months 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
any cash equivalents maintained by the company have original maturities of days or less 
the company does not use any foreign currency in its operations 
operations are vertically integrated  using centralized purchasing and food preparation  provided through the company s commissary and food manufacturing plant 
management believes the commissary operation ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and creates efficiencies that ultimately result in lower food and supply costs 
commodity pricing affects the cost of many of the company s food products 
commodity pricing can be extremely volatile  affected by many factors outside of the company s control  including import and export restrictions  the influence of currency markets relative to the us dollar  supply versus demand  production levels and the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on crop yields 
certain commodities purchased by the commissary  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
these contracts are normally for periods of one year or less but may have longer terms if favorable long term pricing becomes available 
food supplies are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers  which mitigates the company s overall commodity cost risk 
quality  timeliness of deliveries and price are the principal determinants of source 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing
