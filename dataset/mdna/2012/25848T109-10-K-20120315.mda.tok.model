the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  manufacture and market a range of software and hardware storage systems for the entry and mid range storage markets 
beginning in the second half of  we began placing more emphasis on selling higher gross margin products which includes software  appliance products  and hardware products through indirect sales channels 
we have two operating segments  which include storage systems and standalone storage software 
typical customers for our storage systems operating segment  which includes our assuredsan line of storage array products  include organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware  firmware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add various protocol  performance  capacity or data protection schemes as needed 
our broad range of products  from small capacity direct attached to complete multi hundred terabyte  or tb  storage area networks  or sans  provide end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands at compelling price performance points 
our current product family based on our assuredsan architecture provides high performance and large disk array capacities for a broad variety of environments  employing fibre channel  internet small computer systems interface  or iscsi or serial attached scsi  or sas  interconnects to switches and or hosts 
in addition  our assured family of data protection software products provides additional layers of data protection options to complement our line of storage disk arrays 
our current mainstream and series of entry level storage products and just a bunch of disks  or jbod  arrays are targeted primarily at mainstream enterprise and small to medium business  or smb  applications 
our assuredsan series products have been distinguished by certification as network equipment building system  or nebs  level a telecommunications standard for equipment used in central offices and are mil std f a military standard created by the us government compliant based on their ruggedness and reliability 
in february  we launched the latest assuredsan series of storage arrays that provide high speed interface options including gigabyte  or gb  fibre channel  gb and gb iscsi over ethernet and gb sas connectivity 
our standalone storage software operating segment in and consisted of our assureduvs and assuredvra product lines 

table of contents our assureduvs product line  formerly known as the intelligent storage networking system  or isn tm  is based on the technology we acquired in january from cloverleaf communications  inc  or cloverleaf  a privately held software company focused on heterogeneous storage virtualization and unified storage technologies 
such technology was marketed as standalone host based software and also included appliance products consisting of a standard off the shelf x server combined with the proprietary software that delivers the unified virtual storage feature set 
our storage arrays are also available bundled with this appliance 
sales of assureduvs products were not significant in on february  we decided to re align our software investments to focus on accelerating the development of software that will be embedded in our assuredsan product line to better enable us to launch a set of mid range storage products in  provide more differentiated entry level products over time and help position us to win new oem and channel customers that may be looking for new or alternative suppliers resulting from industry consolidation 
since we do not expect to utilize the cloverleaf based software in these mid range product offerings  we have decided to discontinue our investment and development efforts in the cloverleaf based products 
we recently began to market the cloverleaf asset to prospective acquirers and while there have been indications of interest  there is no assurance we will find a suitable buyer on a timely basis 
we have determined that the ongoing cash investment in this operation could outweigh the potential consideration from the sale of this business  and thus  we plan to substantially close down our israeli software development group by march  consequently  we do not expect sales of assureduvs to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenue in the future 
in september  we acquired certain assets  namely raidcore from ciprico inc  or ciprico 
these products are marketed to oem accounts as the assuredvra product line 
this acquisition opened up new markets for us in the enterprise server and workstation markets for data protection internal to the servers and workstations 
in particular  the raidcore acquisition allows us to broaden our product portfolio in the redundant array of independent disks  or raid  market while allowing us to sell into the band market  and to pursue opportunities at current and target oem customers 
we signed our first customer agreement relating to raidcore products in may and began selling to this customer during the third quarter of sales of assuredvra products were not significant in and and we do not expect sales of our assuredvra products to increase  in we do not expect such sales to represent a significant percentage of our future net revenue 
we decided to expand our routes to market beyond our focus on original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and in october of  we launched a dot hill channel program targeted at selling through distributors and resellers 
we continued to expand our channel program in and believe this will provide dot hill with additional sales channels for all of our products 
the majority of sales to our channel partners were represented by our assuredsan line of products in we expect sales to our channel partners of our assuredsan products will increase in our agreements with our customers do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and may be terminated at any time upon notice from the applicable customer 
our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend on  among other things  the level and mix of orders we actually receive from such customers  the actual amounts we spend on marketing support  the actual amounts we spend for inventory support and incremental internal investment  our ability to reduce product cost  our product lead time  our ability to meet delivery schedules required by our customers and the economic environment 
our products and services are sold worldwide to facilitate server and san storage implementations  primarily through oems  and supplemented by system integrators  or sis  distributors and value added resellers  or vars 
our storage system operating segment oem partners currently include  among others  hewlett packard  or hp  sony ericsson  or ericsson  motorola  inc  or motorola  general dynamics government systems corporation  or general dynamics  lockheed martin corporation  or lockheed martin  nec corporation  or nec  tektronix inc  or tektronix  samsung electronics  or samsung  stratus technologies  or stratus  fujitsu technology solutions gmbh  or fts  and concurrent computer corporation  or concurrent 
our standalone storage software operating segment oem partners currently include  among others  dell inc  or 
table of contents dell 
although our products and services are sold worldwide  the majority of our net revenue is derived from our us operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating segments and a breakout of our net revenue by geographical regions 
we began shipping products to hp in the fourth quarter of in january  we amended our agreement with hp to allow for sales of additional products to additional divisions within hp 
our products are primarily sold as hp s msa p product family 
sales to hp increased significantly during and increased again in primarily as a result of the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa products 
hp launched its third generation product line  now called the p product line  in february sales to hp increased again in as we began selling our next generation host interfaces across the hp p product line 
the agreement with hp does not contain any minimum purchase commitments 
in october  we extended our supply agreement with hp by years to expire in october and also extended the expiration of million warrants granted to hp in march to expire concurrently with supply agreement in october net revenue from hp approximated of our total net revenue in we expect sales to hp to continue to represent a substantial percentage of our total net revenue in we expect to generate additional revenue from our indirect channel sales and from sales of our assureduvs and assuredvra products as well as new and potential new oem customers to replace the revenue  and more importantly  the gross profit lost as a result of amending our agreement with netapp 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient gross profit from these sources to largely replace the gross profit previously associated with netapp  our financial results could be harmed 
sales to netapp approximated of our total net revenue in  of our total net revenue in and of our total net revenue in  all of which was attributable to our storage systems operating segment 
in addition  the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our customers  in particular our oem customers  as well as our ability to win new business  our ability to source critical components such as integrated circuits  hard disk drives  memory and other components on a timely basis  the amount of field failures resulting in product replacements or recalls  our ability to launch new products in accordance with oem schedules and milestones  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector  current general economic volatility and trends in the data storage markets in various geographic regions  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  and the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
our manufacturing strategy includes outsourcing substantially all of our manufacturing to third party manufacturers in order to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  enhance working capital and 
table of contents improve margins by taking advantage of the third parties manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
in september  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with foxconn technology group  or foxconn 
under the terms of the agreement  foxconn supplies us with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and final integration services including final assembly  testing and configure to order services through its worldwide facilities 
in november we amended our agreement with foxconn to extend the manufacturing agreement for a period of three years 
in addition  foxconn agreed to waive the requirement for a letter of credit and improved our payment terms foxconn began manufacturing products for us in july and we began shipping products for general availability under the foxconn agreement during the second half of the majority of our products sold in and were manufactured by foxconn 
we expect foxconn to manufacture substantially all of our products in we derive the majority of our net revenue primarily from sales of our series and family of products  which are included in our assuredsan product line within the storage systems operating segment 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead as well as manufacturing variances and freight 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses  consulting charges and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  marketing related costs  advertising  customer related evaluation unit expenses  promotional costs and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions  expenditures for administrative facilities as well as expenditures for legal and accounting services and fluctuations in currency valuations 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in the second quarter of  our management approved  committed to  and initiated a restructuring and cost reduction plan  or the plan  to better align our resources in order to lower our breakeven point 
the plan included severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately of our workforce  and fees associated with the acceleration of the closure of our carlsbad  california facility 
substantially all of our plan workforce reductions were completed by december  and we completely exited our carlsbad facility as of june  on february   our board of directors approved the implementation of a restructuring and cost reduction plan  or the plan  that will include severance and related costs  contractual obligations  administrative costs and long lived asset impairments associated with the closure of our israel technology development center totaling to million 
the plan is designed to re align our software investments to focus on accelerating the development of embedded software features  in order to launch a competitive set of mid range storage array products in  and to provide more differentiated entry level products for both oem and channel customers 
the majority of the activities comprising the plan are expected to be completed by the end of we expect to record severance costs in the range of to million  record contractual obligations in the range of to million  incur legal and other administrative costs in the range of to million and recognize long lived asset impairments of approximately to million in connection with the plan 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on current facts  historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results  future results of operations will be affected 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
we have many accounting policies that require us to make estimates and assumptions  the determination of useful lives of long lived assets  warranty reserves  accruals for estimated restructuring  tax and legal liabilities and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the items listed below are not inclusive of all of our accounting policies but is a listing  identified by management  of those policies which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from sales of our hardware products  software and services 
hardware hardware product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our assuredsan storage systems and our assureduvs appliance products that includes our assureduvs software which is integrated with industry standard hardware which is essential to the functionality of the integrated system product 
we recognize hardware product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized for hardware product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer and in addition  upon installation for certain of our assureduvs appliance products 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other factors known at the time 
if actual future returns and pricing adjustments differ from past experience and our estimates  additional revenue reserves may be required 
software in accordance with the specific guidance for recognizing software revenue  where applicable  we recognize revenue from perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we use the relative method to allocate revenue to software licenses at the inception of the license term when vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for all unspecified software updates and enhancements related to our products through service contracts 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for the fair value of our support services as measured by the stated renewal prices paid by our customers when the services are sold separately on a standalone basis 

table of contents service our service revenue primarily includes out of warranty repairs and product maintenance contracts 
out of warranty repairs primarily consist of product repair services performed by our contract manufacturers for those customers that allowed their original product warranty to expire without purchasing one of our higher level support service plans 
revenue from these out of warranty repairs  and the associated cost of sales  is recognized in the period these services are provided 
service revenue also consists of product maintenance contracts 
revenue from our product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally to months 
net revenue derived from services was less than of total revenue for all periods presented 
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables for multi element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product s functionality  undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product s essential software  and undelivered non software services  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vsoe of fair value  ii third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price  or esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and represents the actual price charged by us for that deliverable 
esps reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
from time to time  we enter into arrangements with customers that include acceptance criteria 
in such instances  we defer all revenue on the arrangement until customer acceptance is obtained or the acceptance clause lapses 
revenue recognition for sales to channel partners on sales to channel partners  we evaluate whether fees are considered fixed or determinable by considering a number of factors  including our ability to estimate returns  payment terms and our relationship and past history with the particular channel partner 
if fees are not considered fixed or determinable at the time of sale to a channel partner  revenue recognition is deferred until there is persuasive evidence indicating the product has sold through to an end user 
persuasive evidence of sell through may include reports from channel partners documenting sell through activity or data indicating an order has shipped to an end user 
deferred revenue we also defer revenue on upfront nonrefundable payments from our customers and recognize it ratably over the term of the agreement  unless the payment is in exchange for products delivered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
when we provide consideration to a customer we recognize the value of that consideration as a reduction in net revenue 
we may be required to maintain inventory with certain of our largest oem customers  which we refer to as hubbing arrangements 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of finished goods and purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead  and are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory 
the determination of excess or obsolete inventory 
table of contents requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
because our markets are volatile  are subject to technological risks  price changes and inventory reduction programs by our customers  and as we are required to make last time buys of certain components on occasion  there is a risk that we will forecast incorrectly and produce excess inventories of particular products or have commitments to purchase excess inventory components from our suppliers 
as a result  actual demand will differ from forecasts  and such a difference has in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and our results of operations 
any write downs to inventory due to the existence of excess quantities  physical obsolescence  changes in pricing  damage  or other causes establish a new cost basis for the inventory 
when we sell or dispose of reserved inventory the new cost basis is charged to cost of sales 
the largest factor affecting the accuracy of our provisions for excess inventories is the accuracy of our production and service forecasts of end customer demand 
the accuracy of our estimates depends in part on the accuracy of the non binding forecasts we get from our end customers  the accuracy of our own forecast of warranty requirements of our customers  the demand for storage systems in our market segments and the speed at which our products are designed in or out of our customers products 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation by measuring and recognizing share based compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  restricted stock awards  performance based restricted stock awards and employee stock purchase plan shares  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award  at the date of grant 
the estimation of stock option and employee stock purchase plan fair value requires management to make complex estimates and judgments about  among other things  employee exercise behavior  forfeiture rates and the volatility of our common stock 
these judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date fair value is calculated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares granted  and is recognized as expense over the respective vesting period 
compensation expense for performance based restricted stock awards is measured similarly to restricted stock  however  compensation expense is only recorded for awards that ultimately vest  which is contingent upon employees achieving various performance criteria 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair values generated by the black scholes model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use historical volatility of our stock for the expected life of the grant as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the historical volatility approach is due to the limited availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 

table of contents valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at november and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our itc reporting unit  which develops our assureduvs software  is a component of the standalone storage software reporting segment identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
during september  our primary assureduvs customer became delinquent on the settlement of its payables to us and upon our investigation it became evident that its financial resources were limited 
it also informed us that they were changing their strategy which would result in a significant decline in our revenue  and we determined it was more likely than not that the reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
current accounting standards require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and market capitalization approach 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets  goodwill is not impaired  and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows 
under the market capitalization approach  valuation multiples are calculated based on operating data from publicly traded companies within our industry 
multiples derived from companies within our industry provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company 
these multiples are applied to the operating data for the reporting unit to arrive at an indicated fair value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the estimated future discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
we base our fair value estimates on forecasted revenue and operating costs along with business plans 
our forecasts consider the effect of a number of factors including  but not limited to  the current future projected competitiveness and market acceptance of the product  technological risk  the ease of use and ease of implementation of the product  the likely outcome of sales and marketing efforts and projected costs associated with product development  customer support and selling  general and administrative costs 
the assumptions and forecasts used were consistent with those used to evaluate certain of our long lived assets for impairment at september  see below 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change and that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
the valuation resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge to goodwill of million for the quarter ended september  no additional goodwill remains on the balance sheet of the company as of december  valuation of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the assets  if any  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 

table of contents all long lived assets identified with the israel technology center  or itc reporting unit are considered one asset group  and are included as a component of the standalone storage software reportable segment 
recent events involving our itc reporting unit resulted in a significant decline in actual and planned earnings 
as of september   we identified a change in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  as our primary assureduvs customer informed us that use of the assureduvs software would no longer be a component of its business strategy  which would result in a significant decline in revenues for the company 
our long lived assets consist of the intangible assets associated with our acquisition of certain identified cloverleaf assets acquired in january with a carrying value of million and property and equipment of million 
since we did not have an immediate replacement for our assureduvs customer  management s forecasted undiscounted cash flows indicated that the assets were potentially not recoverable  and proceeded to estimate the fair value of each long lived asset 
property and equipment comprise mostly machinery and equipment used for testing and development of our assureduvs technology 
management determined that carrying value approximated fair value  as property was either acquired in the acquisition of cloverleaf  has been purchased subsequently  or could be re deployed  establishing recent evidence of fair value 
it is depreciated over a year estimated useful life 
intangible assets consist primarily of acquired software of million and a trade name of million 
we determined the fair value of the acquired software by estimating the replacement cost of the software  taking into account both the software as acquired and subsequent development work  as well as the business alternatives we were considering and the corresponding value of the software in these alternative approaches 
we estimated the value of the software based on the probabilities of each of the business alternatives 
we determined the fair value of the trade name using an income approach and considered the fact that the software s trade name at the time of acquisition was no longer being used 
all estimates were based on management using appropriate assumptions and projections 
our impairment analysis at september  identified million of impaired long lived assets  consisting entirely of intangible assets recognized as part of the cloverleaf acquisition in long lived asset impairment charges are recorded consistent with our treatment of related amortization expense specific to each acquired intangible assets 
we recorded million of impaired acquired software and million of impaired acquired trade name as a component of cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended december  we are evaluating numerous alternatives to monetize the software asset including developing an appliance based on industry standard servers  developing storage bundles with our assuredsan products  developing and porting the software to be based on open source code such as linux  integrating some of the assureduvs features into some of our assuredsan products and making substantial changes to the assureduvs operations 
in february  the board of directors approved a plan to exit our assureduvs business and close down our israel technology development center 
we evaluated the potential impact  if any  on our valuation of our acquired software and other long lived assets maintained at our israel technology development center  and based on the facts and circumstances in existence at december   we believe the current valuations are appropriate 
however  as a result of our decision in the fiscal year to shut down our assureduvs business  we will assess the recorded long lived asset valuation for israel technology development center in the first quarter of 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated percentages may not add due to rounding years ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charge goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge total operating expenses operating loss other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages net revenue the decrease in net revenue for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december   was primarily due to the decision in the fourth quarter of to exit our low margin business with netapp 
sales to netapp totaled million for the year ended december  and totaled for the year ended december  a portion of the lost netapp sales were replaced by sales to oem partners other than hp which grew to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  without netapp sales in  our net revenue would have increased in over sales to hp remained flat year over year totaling million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  due largely to the shortage of hard disk drives in the fourth quarter of as well as hp inventory optimization initiatives 
sales to hp are due to the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa products  which includes our series products and the launch by hp of its third generation product line  now called the p product line  in february  which includes our series products 
although our series products are in the decline phase of the product life cycle  demand for these products continues to be significant 
we released our next generation series products in the first quarter of and sales of these products have increased significantly during each quarter of and remained consistent throughout we expect sales to hp to continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenue in 
table of contents cost of goods sold and gross profit of net revenue of net revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold gross profit cost of goods sold decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the decrease in sales 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to exiting the low margin netapp business  the growth in channel and non hp oem sales  internal cost reduction initiatives and decreases in manufacturing support costs and manufacturing variances 
these decreases were partially offset by the cost of goods sold associated with the increase in sales to other oem customers and the recognition of impairment charges relating to certain of our long lived assets held at our itc reporting unit 
partially offsetting the increase in gross profit margin were higher warranty related expenses of million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in warranty related expenses increased primarily as a result of quality issues associated with certain power supply devices provided by one of our component suppliers that required us to make substantial repairs and provide replacement parts 

our gross profit margin is typically sensitive to product and customer mix changes 
for example  our gross profit margin on sales of the products we sell to hp is higher than the gross profit margin on the products we previously sold to netapp 
in addition  sales of our software products and services typically have a much higher gross profit margin than that of our hardware products 
also  sales to our channel customers typically have a higher gross profit margin than sales to our tier oem customers 
for the year ended december   we generated a higher percentage of our net revenue from our channel customers  non hp oem s and from sales of software and services  which had a favorable impact on our gross profit margin 
we expect that our cost of sales will decrease and our gross profit margin will increase in as a result of expected increases in sales from our channel customers and from sales of services 
we also expect that the mix of products we sell  in particular  the products we sell to hp  will continue to affect  and likely increase  our cost of goods sold and gross profit margin 
research and development expenses of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses research and development expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a net increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million  a net increase in stock compensation expenses of  an increase in engineering materials of  a net increase in depreciation expense of million  an increase in consulting costs of million and an increase in software and maintenance charges of million 
the increase in salary and payroll related expenses is primarily a result of the additional employees engaged in research and development activities associated with the development of next generation entry level products and a mid range product line  as well as additional investments in our assureduvs business 
the increase in 
table of contents stock compensation expenses is due to a large portion of stock awards vesting in early when the stock price was elevated compared with the prior year 
the increase in engineering materials is largely the result of the timing of our engineering material purchases in conjunction with the release of our next generation of products anticipated for consulting costs increased largely as a result of certain engineering functions being performed by consultants in india and an increase in the use of domestic engineering consultants to assist with certain strategic development projects 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily the result of the additional equipment acquired in the cloverleaf acquisition and also due to additional capital expenditures for our longmont engineering labs 
of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in commissions and bonuses of million  a net increase in stock compensation expenses of million  a net increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million  an increase in bank fees of million  an increase in travel expenses of million  and other miscellaneous net increases of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in customer related evaluation product expenses of million 
the increase in commissions and bonuses is due to better performance against sales goals 
the net increase in stock compensation expenses is due to a new stock bonus plan in and an overall increase in awards 
the net increase in salary and payroll related expenses is primarily a result of additional employees engaged in sales and marketing activities as a result of an increase in the number of sales territories we support and the continued expansion of our channel program 
the increase in travel expenses was primarily the result of an increase in sales team employees and customer visits 
the increase in bank fees is for credit card merchant fees assessed for one customer that pays by credit card

these decreases were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation related expenses of million and an increase in bad debt expenses of million 
the change in accounting  legal and advisory fees was primarily the result of negotiating lower fees with our service providers 
the reduction in salary and payroll related expenses primarily was attributable to a reduction in salaries mandated by executive management that were in effect for part of and for all of consulting fees were elevated in compared with as the company made the conscious decision in to hire temporary labor instead of full time employees anticipating the move from carlsbad  california to longmont  colorado

in the second quarter of  our management approved  committed to  and initiated a restructuring and cost reduction plan  or the plan  to better align our resources in order to lower our breakeven point 
the plan included severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately of our workforce  and fees associated with the acceleration of the closure of our carlsbad  california facility 
for the year ended december   we incurred severance and related costs of million related to both our plan and plan 
we also incurred contract termination costs of million for the year ended december  primarily for facility lease and other associated costs that we continued to incur without economic benefit and due to revisions to our assumptions regarding the timing and amount of tenant sublease income under both our plan and plan 
we also incurred additional severance related restructuring charges of approximately million in related to the termination of a former employee of cloverleaf 
all of the severance related costs were paid to this employee in the million restructuring expense for the year ended december  is primarily related to management s determination that sublease rental income anticipated on the carlsbad  california facility would not materialize  and the associated write off of that expected rental income

table of contents the decrease in other income  net for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense related to the amortization of financing fees for amending our credit agreement with silicon valley bank in february  income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  and an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes in both years primarily represents state  local and foreign taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages net revenue the increase in net revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in sales to hp 
sales to hp totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the for the year ended december  the increase in hp net revenue is due to the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa products  which includes our series products and the launch by hp of its third generation product line  now called the p product line  in february  which includes our series products 
although our series products are in the decline phase of the product life cycle  demand for these products continues to be significant 
we released our next generation series products in the first quarter of and sales of these products have increased significantly during each quarter of in addition  sales to netapp increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  based on the success of netapp s fas product line 
sales to netapp totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  however  under our agreement with netapp  netapp had the right to manufacture and sell  on a royalty and royalty free basis  up to certain specified percentages of the products we previously manufactured and sold to netapp 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit our low margin business with netapp and amended our agreement with netapp to allow netapp to manufacture and sell on a royalty free basis all of the products we previously manufactured and sold to netapp beginning on or about december  we expect to generate additional revenue from our indirect channel sales as well as new and potential new oem customers to replace the revenue  and more importantly  the gross profit lost as a result of amending our agreement with netapp 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient gross profit from these sources to largely replace the gross profit previously associated with netapp  our financial results could be harmed 
we also experienced an increase in net revenue of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of the launch of our channel program in october of  sales of our assureduvs products  which are based on the technology acquired as part of the cloverleaf acquisition in january and increased sales of our assuredvra products as we renegotiated our contract with a major oem customer in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from oracle  fts  sepaton and other smaller customers 
oracle sales decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in oracle net revenue is due to the products we sell to oracle reaching the end of their product life cycle 
fts sales decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net 
table of contents revenue from fts is due to fts s decision to internally source the product we sell to fts 
in addition  we also experienced a decline in sales to sepaton of approximately million as a result of sepaton buying their storage requirements from another source 
we also experienced a net decline in sales to other smaller customers of approximately million 
cost of goods sold and gross profit of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold gross profit cost of goods sold increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in sales 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the continued success of our product cost reduction and value engineering initiatives over the past few years which has significantly reduced our costs for both our series and products that we sell to hp and other customers 
in addition  we incurred lower excess and obsolete inventory and scrap charges as a result of various product end of life issues experienced in and improved inventory management practices in we were also able to negotiate early payment and volume discounts in  which resulted in lower costs and a higher gross profit margin 
we also incurred fewer inventory holding charges as we were able to more efficiently manage inventories being held by our contract manufacturing partners and experienced a decrease in manufacturing overhead costs primarily as a result of our restructuring activities 
partially offsetting the increase in gross profit margin were higher amortization expense  warranty related expenses and freight costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in warranty related expenses increased as a result of a higher volume of quality related warranty claims  as we experienced component failure issues with certain of our battery and hard disk drive suppliers  as well as firmware failures within one of our products 
additionally  freight costs increased as a result of the increase in revenue and overall shipment volume as well as from expedite charges 
amortization expense increased due to the inclusion of ciprico amortization in cost of goods sold as a result of the acquired products now generating revenue  as well as additional amortization resulting from the cloverleaf acquisition 
prior to  ciprico amortization was included in research and development expense 
our gross profit margin is typically sensitive to product and customer mix changes 
for example  our gross profit margin on sales of the products we sell to hp is higher than the gross profit margin on the products we previously sold to netapp 
conversely  the gross profit margin on sales of the products we previously sold to oracle is higher than that of the products we currently sell to hp 
in addition  sales of our software products and services typically have a much higher gross profit margin than that of our hardware products 
also  sales to our channel customers and non hp oem customers typically have a higher gross profit margin than sales to hp 
for the year ended december   we generated a lower percentage of our net revenue from oracle  which had an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin 
however  we generated a higher percentage of our net revenue from our channel customers and from sales of software and services  which had a favorable impact on our gross profit margin 
we expected that our cost of sales will decrease and our gross profit margin will increase in as a result of exiting our relationship with netapp and as a result of expected increases in sales from our channel customers and from sales of software and services 
we also expected that the mix of products we sell  in particular  the products we sell to hp  will continue to affect our cost of goods sold and gross profit margin 

table of contents research and development expenses of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses research and development expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million  an increase in consulting costs of million  an increase in depreciation expense of million  and increases in various other items such as facilities and common expenses and travel  which approximated million 
in addition  in and  we determined it was probable that the amount of contingent consideration due to ciprico would be lower based on lower actual and projected sales of products eligible for the contingent consideration through the end of the contingent consideration period 
accordingly  we reduced the contingent consideration liability and research and development expense in the statement of operations to reflect the reduction in estimated contingent consideration liability 
the reduction to research and development expense approximated million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   or a change of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in ciprico intangible asset amortization expense of million and a decrease in engineering materials expense of million 
the increase in salary and payroll related expenses is primarily a result of the additional employees engaged in research and development activities associated with the cloverleaf acquisition 
consulting costs increased largely as a result of certain engineering functions being performed by consultants in india and an increase in the use of domestic engineering consultants to assist with certain strategic development projects 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily the result of the additional equipment acquired in the cloverleaf acquisition and also due to additional capital expenditures for our longmont engineering labs 
ciprico intangible asset amortization expense decreased as the related assuredvra product is now generating revenue and therefore the amortization is included in cost of sales 
the decrease in engineering materials expense is largely the result of the timing of our engineering material purchases in conjunction with the release of our next generation series products  which occurred in the first quarter of sales and marketing expenses of net revenue of net revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in customer related evaluation product expenses of million  an increase in marketing research  public relations and promotional expenses of million  an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million  and an increase in travel expenses of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in facilities and common costs of million as a result of our restructuring activities

these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million and an increase in travel expenses of million 
the change in foreign currency gains and losses were primarily the result of changes in the value of the euro and british pound in relation to the united states dollar 
the reduction in legal fees was primarily the result of lower fees associated with litigation matters as certain claims against us were dismissed in the first quarter of the reduction in sarbanes oxley fees were primarily the result of negotiating lower fees with our service provider 
board of director fees decreased as a result of a reduction in the number of members of our board of directors

income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes primarily represents state  local and foreign taxes 
the benefit from income taxes primarily represents federal tax credits  partially offset by state  local and foreign income taxes 
the federal tax credits available to us for the year ended december  were not available in liquidity and capital resources the primary drivers affecting cash and liquidity are the cash portion of our net losses  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
historically  the payment terms we have had to offer our customers have been relatively similar to the terms received from our creditors and suppliers 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard credit quality and payment terms ranging between net and net days 
if our net revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could further increase if customers  in particular large oem customers  delay their payments or if we grant them extended payment terms 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital compared to million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital as of december  cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of days or less and consist principally of money market funds 
in addition  we had million in short term debt at december   consisting of a note payable issued in connection with the acquisition of certain intangible assets from ciprico 
as of december   million of the million of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million of cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  the operating activities that affected cash consisted primarily of a net loss which totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our net loss was significantly attributable to asset impairment charges totaling million taken in 
table of contents the adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  that did not affect cash consisted of depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million  goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges of million  issuance of warrants of million and a bad debt charge of million 
cash flows from operations reflects the positive impact of million related to a decrease in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue in however  this was offset somewhat by an increase in our days sales outstanding which increased to days for the three months ended december  compared with days for the three months ended december  primarily due to the timing of intra quarter sales 
cash flows from operations also reflects the positive impact of million related to an overall decrease in inventories at december   as a larger portion of our inventory in was purchased directly from vendors by our contract manufacturers as opposed to in where we more often acted as a middleman in these transactions 
an additional source of cash flows from operations is million related to an increase in accrued compensation and other expenses which was the result of a million increase in contingent liabilities related to the recognition of potential payouts on the issue of the power supply failures  an increase of million in accrued management bonuses as a result of management attaining certain bonus criteria  a increase in accrued commissions and bonuses as a result of the sales force attaining certain of its goals  and an offsetting net decrease in miscellaneous accrued accounts 
cash flows from operations include uses of cash of million related to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due to million of asset recovery  the timing of other receivables from our contract manufacturing partners for component parts we buy and ship to them and also due to the timing of payments for various miscellaneous receivables 
in addition  cash flows from operations include uses of cash of million of other long term liabilities primarily related to payments of deferred rent  million of deferred revenues and million in restructuring payments 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was due primarily to the continuous expansion of our laboratories associated with the development of new products 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  is attributable to million of proceeds from the sale of stock to employees under our employee stock plans  offset by million for the ongoing pay down of our note payable associated with our acquisition of certain intangible assets from ciprico 
based on current macro economic conditions and conditions in the state of the data storage systems markets  our own organizational structure and our current outlook for  we presently expect our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
our standard warranty provides that if our systems do not function to published specifications  we will repair or replace the defective component or system without charge generally for a period of approximately three years 
we generally extend to our customers the warranties provided to us by our suppliers and  accordingly  the majority of our warranty obligations to customers are intended to be covered by corresponding supplier warranties 
there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to provide such warranties to us in the future or that our warranty obligations to our customers will be covered by corresponding warranties from our suppliers  the absence of which could have a potentially significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents in october  we discovered a quality issue associated with certain power supply devices provided by a long term component supplier  which resulted in a higher than expected level of power supply failures to us and our customers 
while we were able to promptly identify and resolve the cause of the failures  we are required to provide replacement products or make repairs to the affected power supply units that had been sold between march and october through june   our component supplier had repaired all of the faulty power supplies at no cost to us  and reimbursed us for our out of pocket costs which has constituted a reimbursement to customers for certain out of pocket costs they incurred in connection with these power supply failures 
the total amount reimbursed to us by our component supplier approximated million through june  during the third and fourth quarters of and into the first quarter of  we entered negotiations for a settlement with a material customer 
based on our current expectation of how any such additional product quality claims will ultimately be settled  we believe that we will probably incur a liability of million 
consequently  we recorded an additional liability of million on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  to increase this liability to million 
in addition we have agreed to extend the original three year warranty on the affected power supplies to six years 
in addition  we entered into negotiations with our component supplier during the third and fourth quarters of and into the first quarter of  to attempt to recover any losses not previously reimbursed relating to the failed power supply units 
in february  we signed a non binding letter of intent with our component supplier whereby we expect to receive million upon signing of the final settlement agreement and a million note receivable to be paid out in four  equal installments commencing three months after signing the final settlement agreement  regardless of future purchases from this supplier 
in addition  this supplier will extend the warranty on the impacted power supplies from three years to six years and we will be eligible to receive incremental product discounts which are not reasonably estimable 
we have increased the previously recorded current asset of million within prepaid expenses and other assets to million as of december  furthermore  we have commenced discussions with our general liability and errors and omissions insurance and underwriters and will continue to pursue our rights to cover any damages we incur and not reimbursed by our supplier 
the insurance company has issued a reservation of rights letter to us and at this time it is not possible to estimate to what extent  if any  will be covered by our carrier 
as of december   we have not assumed or recorded any insurance reimbursement 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in negotiating settlement agreements with our customer and our component supplier on mutually beneficial terms  or our component supplier does not continue to reimburse us for the expenses incurred by us or our customers  and we are unsuccessful in recovering such expenses from our insurance provider  we could incur additional expenses which could potentially have a material effect on our financial statements 
recently  the hard disk drive component supply chain has been significantly disrupted as a result of severe flooding in thailand 
in addition  some disk drive manufacturers have substantial manufacturing facilities in thailand that have been closed down due to flooding 
it is estimated that over of the worldwide production of hard disk drives or critical component occurs in thailand 
while over of our revenue typically comes from customers who purchase our assuredsan products on a drive less basis  hard disk drives are a critical component in our assuredsan storage array products and can represent of the cost of such products 
given the severity of the situation and the potential for extensive hard disk drive shortages for us and our customers  we believe the effects on our business and the data storage industry are likely to be substantial and could extend over multiple quarters 
we will make every effort to secure and hold inventory of hard disk drives to incorporate into our products 
any purchase of hard drives beyond our immediate requirements  will likely result in increased inventory and a use of cash  but we expect any increase in hard drive inventory holdings to be consumed through our normal sales to customers over the near term 
given that approximately only one quarter of revenue are 
table of contents dependent on hard disk drive supplies  and given our current cash balances and the availability of additional working capital through silicon valley bank  we do not believe we would be constrained in our ability to secure hard disk drives 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and extent of net revenue and expenditures from our core business and strategic investments  the ability to maintain payment terms with our suppliers consistent with the credit terms of our customers  the overall level of net profits or losses  our ability to manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers  the potential growth or decline in inventory to support our customers  costs associated with product quality issues and the recovery  if any  of such costs by a supplier  the status of our relationships with key customers  partners and suppliers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services  growth in operations and the economic environment 
we maintain a credit facility with silicon valley bank for cash advances and letters of credit of up to an aggregate of million based upon an advance rate of of eligible accounts receivable 
in february  we amended our credit agreement with silicon valley bank 
the amendment extends the maturity date to july   revises the definition of eligible accounts receivable to be less restrictive and also revises the definition of net worth to add stock based compensation expense  goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges  subject to certain limitations 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the prime rate and are secured by substantially all of our accounts receivable  deposit and securities accounts 
the agreement provides for a negative pledge on our inventory and intellectual property  subject to certain exceptions  and contains usual and customary covenants for an arrangement of its type  including an obligation that we maintain at all times a net worth  as defined in the agreement  of million subject to certain increases 
the agreement also includes provisions to increase the financing facility by million subject to our meeting certain requirements  including million in borrowing base for the immediately preceding days  and silicon valley bank locating a lender willing to finance the additional facility 
in addition  if our cash and cash equivalents net of the total amount outstanding under the credit facility fall below million measured on a rolling three month basis  the interest rate will increase to prime plus and additional restrictions will apply 
our credit facility also provides for a cash management services sublimit under the revolving credit line of up to  as of december  we had an outstanding letter of credit issued to our contract manufacturer in china in the amount of million 
as of december   we are no longer required to carry this letter of credit 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the silicon valley bank line of credit 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
contractual obligations total thereafter operating lease obligations inventory related purchase obligations other purchase obligations note payable total we lease office space  equipment and automobiles under non cancelable operating leases  which expire at various dates through june for purposes of the table above  the operating lease obligations exclude common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance expenses 
inventory related purchase obligations represent contractual purchase commitments to our suppliers for certain components in order to ensure supply of select key components at the most favorable pricing 
other purchase obligations represent purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business 

table of contents in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships and transactions with persons and entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein 
we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business that generally require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events  such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the asu requires companies to report comprehensive income  including items of other comprehensive income  for all periods presented in a single continuous financial statement in the consolidated statements of operations or split between the consolidated statements of operations and a separate consolidated statements of other comprehensive income 
the asu is effective for our first quarter of fiscal year other than requiring additional disclosures  the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu asu 
asu defers the specific requirement within asu to present on the face of the financial statements items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
the effective dates for asu are consistent with the effective dates for asu and  similar to our evaluation for the adoption of asu  the adoption of this guidance does not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we place our cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions  investing primarily in money market accounts 
we have established guidelines relative to credit ratings  diversification and maturities that seek to maintain safety and liquidity 
our investment strategy generally results in lower yields on investments but reduces the risk to principal in the short term prior to these funds being invested in our business 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents 
a unfavorable change in the interest rate would not materially impact our december  balance sheet 

table of contents we have a line of credit agreement  which accrues interest on any outstanding balances at the prime rate 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this line 
if we make borrowings under this line  we will be exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
indicated changes in interest rates are based on hypothetical movements and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
future earnings and losses will be affected by actual fluctuations in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar  the currency in which our consolidated financial statements are reported 
the most significant foreign currencies that subjected us to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december  were the euro  british pound  japanese yen and the israeli new shekel 
correspondingly  our operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the us dollar 
although we continue to evaluate strategies to mitigate risks related to the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we will likely continue to recognize gains or losses from international transactions and foreign currency changes 
although foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not historically been material  we incurred million in foreign currency transaction gains during the year ended december   primarily resulting from the remeasurement process of certain of our european subsidiaries that maintain their books of record in a currency other than the functional currency 
future changes in foreign currency rates could adversely impact our operating results 
a unfavorable change in exchange rates would result in foreign currency losses of approximately million
