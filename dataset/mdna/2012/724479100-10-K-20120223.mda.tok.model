overview in  revenue decreased to  million compared to the prior year 
foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on revenue 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  the decrease in overall revenue was caused by lower equipment sales  supplies revenue  rental and financing revenue and services revenue 
software revenue increased compared to the prior year 
net income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was million  or per diluted share for compared to million or per diluted share for these results include the following items in february  our largest mail presort facility located in dallas  texas was destroyed by a fire and we were unable to process customer mail at full capacity for a significant part of the year 
we estimate that lost revenue from the fire was approximately million 
through december   we received million of insurance proceeds  which primarily relates to the reimbursement of lost revenue  replacement cost of equipment and additional expenses incurred as a result of the fire 
we recognized million of insurance recoveries in other income 
the new dallas presort facility has now reached operational efficiency comparable to the previous facility  due to the continuing underperformance and long term outlook of the international mailing services operations ims of our mail services segment  we recorded aggregate pre tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  further  based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment review process  we recorded additional pre tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively related to the international operations of our management services segment pbmsi  in september  we completed a sale of non us leveraged lease assets resulting in cash proceeds of million and an after tax gain of million 
during the year  we entered into a series of settlements with the irs in connection with its examinations of our tax years under which we agreed upon both the tax treatment of a number of disputed issues  including issues related to our capital services business that was sold in  and revised tax calculations 
as a result of these settlements  we recognized tax benefits of million in income from continuing operations and million in discontinued operations 
our additional liability for tax and interest arising from the irs examinations was approximately million  which was previously paid through the purchase of tax bonds 
we generated million in cash from operations  which was used primarily to reduce debt by million  repurchase million of our common stock  pay million of dividends to our common stockholders and fund capital investments of million 
net income attributable to pitney bowes was million  or per diluted share and included million  or per diluted share from discontinued operations 
outlook the worldwide economy and business environment continued to be uncertain during and we believe it will continue to be uncertain in we anticipate physical mail volumes will continue their gradual decline as alternative means of communications evolve and gain further acceptance 
as a result  small and medium business solutions smb revenue growth should continue to be challenged 
we anticipate a gradual improvement in equipment sales in due  in part  to sales of connect tm communications systems  but a recovery in smb revenues will lag any recovery in equipment sales 
we anticipate revenue growth from increased demand for multi year software licensing agreements  increased placements of production print equipment and continued expansion in mail services operations will help offset the anticipated decline in smb revenues 
we will continue our focus on streamlining our business operations and creating more flexibility in our cost structure 
our growth strategies will focus on leveraging our expertise in physical communications with our expanding capabilities in digital and hybrid communications 
we will continue to develop and invest in products  software  services and solutions that help customers grow their business by more effectively managing their physical and digital communications with their customers 
over time  we expect our mix of revenue to change  with a greater percentage of revenue coming from enterprise related products and solutions 
we also expect to roll out other digitally based products and services but do not expect them to have a significant impact on our revenues for results of operations compared to business segment results we conduct our business activities in seven reporting segments within two business groups  small medium business solutions smb solutions and enterprise business solutions eb solutions 
the following table shows revenue and ebit for each segment in and segment ebit  a non gaap measure  is determined by deducting from segment revenue the related costs and expenses attributable to the segment 
segment ebit excludes interest  taxes  general corporate expenses not allocated to a particular business segment  restructuring charges  asset impairments  and goodwill charges  which are recognized on a consolidated basis 
management uses segment ebit to measure profitability and performance at the segment level 
segment ebit may not be indicative of our overall consolidated performance and therefore  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated results of operations 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment ebit to income from continuing operations before income taxes

excluding the effects of foreign currency  equipment sales declined as increased concerns about economic conditions resulted in customers delaying purchases of new equipment and extending leases of existing equipment 
lease extensions are profitable transactions but generate less revenue in the current period than new equipment sales 
the lagging effects of lower equipment sales in prior periods  fewer meter placements and declining mail volumes contributed to declines in financing revenue  rental revenue  supplies revenue and service revenue 
the decrease in ebit was primarily due to lower revenues  however  ebit margin improved as a result of continued productivity improvements and lower credit losses 
international mailing revenue increased to million compared to the prior year  but included a favorable impact of from foreign currency translation

results of operations compared to business segment results the following table shows revenue and ebit in and by business segment

within the small medium business solutions group north america mailing revenue decreased to  million and ebit decreased to million  compared to the prior year 
the revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower financing  rental  service and supplies revenues 
the decrease in financing revenue is due to a decline in our leasing portfolio from reduced equipment sales in recent years 
rental  supplies and service revenues were lower than prior year due to fewer placements of new meters 
equipment sales and supplies revenue were lower than prior year due to business consolidations  lease extensions and reduced volumes of mail processed 
lease extensions have a positive impact on profit margins longer term but negatively impact equipment sales revenue in the current year 
revenue was also adversely affected by the ongoing changing mix to more fully featured smaller systems 
foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on revenue 
the lower ebit was due to the decline in higher margin financing  rental and supplies revenues  which more than offset the impact from a favorable adjustment related to certain leveraged lease transactions in canada 
international mailing revenue decreased to million compared to the prior year  including a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 
while equipment sales were up slightly in certain parts of europe  this increase was offset by continued declines in financing and rental revenues due to reduced equipment sales in recent years

ebit increased to million compared to last year due to the higher revenue and our initiatives to improve productivity and consolidate administrative functions 
foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on ebit

ebit was negatively impacted by transaction related fees of approximately million associated with the portrait acquisition 
foreign currency translation had a less than favorable impact on ebit 
management services revenue decreased compared to last year to million due to the loss of several large postal contracts and decreased print volumes 
despite the lower revenues  ebit increased over the prior year to million primarily due to our actions to align costs with changing volumes through a more variable cost infrastructure  ongoing productivity initiatives and a focus on more profitable contracts 
foreign currency translation had a less than impact on both revenue and ebit 
mail services revenue was flat compared to last year at million  while ebit decreased to million 
mail services revenue and ebit were adversely impacted by million and million  respectively  due to a one time out of period adjustment in the international mail services portion of the business primarily related to a correction to the rates used to estimate earned but unbilled revenue for the periods through the first quarter of the impact of this adjustment was not material on any individual quarter or year during these periods 
excluding the impact of this adjustment  revenue increased over the prior year  but ebit decreased 
the revenue increase was driven partially by increased volumes of presort mail and standard class mail processed and acquisitions 
the decrease in ebit was driven by higher shipping rates charged by international carriers for our international mail services business  which more than offset the favorable margin impacts in our presort business 
marketing services revenue of million was flat compared to the prior year 
revenue was impacted by increased vendor advertising for movers source kits offset by a decline in household moves compared to prior year 
ebit increased over last year due to more profitable vendor revenue per transaction

in  we announced that we were undertaking a series of strategic transformation initiatives designed to transform and enhance the way we operate as a global company the program 
the program aims to enhance our responsiveness to changing market conditions and create improved processes and systems to further enable us to invest in future growth in areas such as our global customer interactions and product development processes 
total pre tax costs for this program were approximately million 
at the end of  the program is substantially completed and annualized run rate net benefits of this program are projected to be approximately million in we do not anticipate any further significant charges under this program 
most of the costs were cash related charges 
the majority of the remaining restructuring payments are expected to be paid over the next months 
due to certain international labor laws and long term lease agreements  some payments will extend beyond months 
we expect that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these payments 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash flow from operations  existing cash and investments  as well as borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program should be sufficient to support our business operations  interest and dividend payments  share repurchases  capital expenditures  and to cover customer deposits 
we have the ability to supplement this short term liquidity  if necessary  and fund the long term needs of our business through broad access to capital markets  a credit line facility  and our effective shelf registration statement 
at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand were million 
cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries are generally used to support the liquidity needs of these subsidiaries 
most of these amounts could be repatriated to the united states but would be subject to additional taxes 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
it is our intention to permanently reinvest substantially all of these funds in our foreign operations

we monitor the creditworthiness of those banks acting as derivative counterparties  depository banks or credit providers 
there has not been a material variation in the underlying sources of cash flows currently used to finance the operations of the company 
to date  we have had consistent access to the commercial paper market 
cash flow summary the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
a decrease in finance receivables contributed million of cash as cash collections exceeded the financing of new business and a decrease in accounts receivables contributed million in cash primarily due to improved cash collections in excess of new billings

cash flows net cash flow provided by operating activities included million and million from decreases in finance receivables and accounts receivables  respectively  primarily due to lower sales volumes  and an increase in current and non current income taxes of million due to the timing of tax payments 
these cash inflows were partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  primarily due to timing of payments  voluntary pension plan contributions of million and restructuring payments of million 
net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million for property  plant and equipment and rental equipment and related inventories 
net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of dividends paid to common stockholders of million  a net reduction in debt of million  and a net cash outflow associated with the issuance and redemption of preferred stock issued by a subsidiary of million 
financings and capitalization we are a well known seasoned issuer with the sec  which allows us to issue debt securities  preferred stock  preference stock  common stock  purchase contracts  depositary shares  warrants and units in an expedited fashion 
we have a commercial paper program that is an important source of liquidity for us and a committed line of credit of billion to support our commercial paper issuances 
the line of credit expires in we have not experienced any problems to date in accessing the commercial paper market 
as of december   we have not drawn upon the line of credit 
during the year  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest payments on our million notes due in into variable rates 
under the terms of these agreements  we pay a weighted average variable rate based on three month libor plus basis points and receive fixed rate payments of 
in  we unwound two interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed rate payments on the million notes due in into variable rates  and received million  excluding accrued interest 
this amount is being recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the remaining term of the notes 
the transaction was not undertaken for liquidity purposes  but rather to fix our effective interest rate at for the remaining term of the notes 
during the fourth quarter of  million of long term debt is scheduled to mature 
we are currently evaluating available options  including using available cash to repay some of this debt 
we may also refinance some or all of this amount with short term borrowings under our commercial paper program or through the issuance of long term debt 
at december   there was no outstanding commercial paper 
during the year  commercial paper borrowings averaged million at a weighted average interest rate of and the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding at any point in time was million

in february  we signed an agreement to sell certain leveraged lease assets to the lessee for million 
we expect to recognize an after tax gain  which will be finalized in the first quarter of contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following summarizes our known contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest payments on debt non cancelable operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total the amount and period of future payments related to our income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and are not included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
interest payments on debt includes interest on our million notes due in this note contains an option that gives bondholders the right to redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at par plus accrued interest  in january if all million of the notes are redeemed  interest payments in the more than five years column would be million lower than the amount shown in the table above

purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other non current liabilities relate primarily to our postretirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and accompanying disclosures  including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s best knowledge of current events  historical experience  and other information available when the financial statements are prepared 
the accounting policies below have been identified by management as those accounting policies that are critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the accounting policies below are reasonable and appropriate based on the information available at the time the financial statements were prepared  however  actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition multiple element and internal financing arrangements we derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales  rentals  financing and services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the most common form of these transactions involves a sale or non cancelable lease of equipment  a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in multiple element arrangements  revenue is recognized for each of the elements based on their respective fair values 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
the allocation of fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements using their respective fair values  which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions 
for a sale transaction  revenue is allocated to the equipment based on a range of selling prices in standalone transactions 
for a lease transaction  revenue is allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments 
we then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average selling prices 
we provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases 
the vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria 
we believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk 
accordingly  we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue  the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as finance receivables 
the difference between the finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest method 
equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term 
estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience 
we also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products  product retirement and future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  regulatory changes  remanufacturing strategies  used equipment markets  if any  competition and technological changes 
we evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we believe that our credit risk for accounts receivable is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances for most of our customers and customer geographic and industry diversification 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to pay and prevailing economic conditions  and make adjustments to the reserves as necessary 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and actual results may differ significantly from estimated reserves 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivable risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
we establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of the customer and the type of equipment financed 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances for most of our customers and customer geographic and industry diversification 
our policy is to discontinue revenue recognition for lease receivables that are more than days past due and for unsecured loan receivables that are more than days past due 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to pay and prevailing economic conditions  and make adjustments to the reserves as necessary 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and actual results may differ significantly from estimated reserves 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates  tax reserve changes and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax laws 
the amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
as new information becomes available that would alter our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that will ultimately be realized  we adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings  three to years for machinery and equipment  four to six years for rental equipment and three to five years for computer equipment 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease term 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally three to years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method or an accelerated attrition method over their estimated useful lives  which are principally three to years 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans 
changes to the assets estimated useful lives could have a material impact on our results of operations 
impairment review long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
if such a change in circumstances occurs  the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is compared to the carrying amount 
we derive the cash flow estimates from our future long term business plans and historical experience 
if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded 
the impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the impaired asset is determined using probability weighted expected discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and appraisals  as appropriate 
changes in the estimates and assumptions incorporated in our impairment assessment could materially affect the determination of fair value and the associated impairment charge 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  during the fourth quarter  or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step approach 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination and the purchase price was equivalent to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
significant estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment review include the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on a combination of techniques  including the present value of future cash flows  applicable multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses  and requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding discount rates  growth rates  and our future long term business plans 
changes in any of these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the associated goodwill impairment charge for each reporting unit 
due to continuing underperformance of our ims operations and based on information that was received during the early stages of our annual budgeting and long term planning process started in the third quarter  management concluded that it was appropriate to perform a goodwill impairment review for ims 
we determined the fair value of ims using a combination of techniques including the present value of future cash flows  multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses  and determined that the ims reporting unit was impaired 
we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test and determined that the implied fair value of goodwill for ims was less than its carrying value and a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized 
our analysis indicated that certain identifiable intangible assets of ims were also impaired and an impairment charge of million was recognized 
at december   the remaining carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill for ims was million and million  respectively 
based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment review process  we determined that our pbmsi operations were impaired 
similar to ims  the fair value of pbmsi was determined using a combination of techniques including the present value of future cash flows  derived from our long term plans and historical experience  multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses and the estimated fair value was allocated to the assets and liabilities of pbmsi 
our analysis showed that the implied fair value of goodwill for pbmsi was less than its carrying value and a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized 
in addition  the impairment review indicated that certain identifiable intangible assets were also impaired and an impairment charge of million was recognized 
at december   there are no intangible assets carried on pbmsi and the remaining carrying value of goodwill is million 
further  based on the results of our annual impairment review  the estimated fair values of our other reporting units were considered substantially in excess of their respective carrying values  except for the us operations of our management services segment pbms us 
the estimated fair value of pbms us exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
at december   the net identifiable intangible assets of pbms us were million and goodwill allocated to pbms us was million 
as noted in the outlook section above  the worldwide economy and business environment continue to be uncertain and impact our current and expected future financial performance  and as a result have increased the possibility of future non cash impairment charges for goodwill and or identifiable intangible assets 
accordingly  we will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets for all our reporting units 
business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
the fair value of intangible assets is estimated using a cost  market or income approach 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
stock based compensation expense we recognize compensation cost for stock based expense based on the estimated fair value of the award  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we recognize compensation costs for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the use of this valuation model requires assumptions be made regarding the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life of the award and dividend yield 
the estimate of stock price volatility is based on historical price changes of our stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasuries with a term equal to the expected option term 
the expected life  or holding period  of the award  and the expected dividend yield  is based on historical experience 
we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our stock based awards 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be different in the future 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
restructuring we have undertaken restructuring actions which require management to utilize certain estimates related to the amount and timing of expenses 
if the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be impacted 
pension benefits assumptions and estimates the valuation and calculation of our net pension expense  assets and obligations are dependent on assumptions and estimates relating to discount rate  rate of compensation increase and expected return on plan assets 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the weighted average assumptions for our largest plan  the us qualified pension plan  and our largest foreign plan  the uk qualified pension plan  used to determine net periodic pension costs for are as follows us plan uk plan discount rate rate of compensation increase expected return on plan assets us plan the discount rate for our u 
s pension plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date 
the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans investment portfolio after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes 
the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is determined based on the target asset allocations for each asset class  adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results  when compared to the benchmark returns 
when assessing the expected future returns for the portfolio  we place more emphasis on the expected future returns than historical returns 
uk plan we determine our discount rate for the uk retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each year s estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate 
these spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  the plan s asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan 
changes to the above assumptions can have an impact on annual pension expense and recorded pension liabilities 
for instance a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million for both the us and us pension plans  and lower the projected benefit obligation of the us and us pension plans by million and million  respectively  a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by less than million for both the us and uk pension plans  a increase in the expected return on assets would decrease annual pension expense for the us and us pension plans by approximately million and million  respectively 
delayed recognition principles actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and affect future pension expense 
net pension expense is also based on a market related valuation of plan assets where differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets are amortized to pension expense over a five year period 
investment related risks and uncertainties we invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy 
the composition of our us pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate and private equity investments 
the composition of our uk pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and cash 
investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
in particular  due to the level of risk associated with investment securities  it is reasonably possible that change in the value of such investment securities will occur and that such change could materially affect our future results 
new accounting pronouncements on january   new accounting guidance became effective addressing the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple elements and certain revenue arrangements that include software 
this guidance allows companies to allocate consideration in a multiple element arrangement in a way that better reflects the economics of the transaction and results in the elimination of the residual method 
in addition  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product were scoped out of the software revenue guidance 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in  new guidance was introduced that would eliminate the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity  and require an entity to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
this guidance would be effective in the first quarter of  with early adoption permitted 
we have elected to early adopt this guidance effective december  and have presented the components of other comprehensive income in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the adoption of this guidance only changed the way we present other comprehensive income and its components  and did not impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
legal and regulatory matters legal see legal proceedings in item of this form k for information regarding our legal proceedings 
other regulatory matters as is the case with other large corporations  we are continually under examination by tax authorities in the united states  other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations 
the years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
except for a dispute arising out of a partnership investment  the irs examination of tax years is closed to audit and the examination of years is estimated to be closed to audit within the next months 
we have other domestic and international tax filings currently under examination or subject to examination 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
however  the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently undergoing unclaimed property audits  which are being conducted by various state authorities 
the property subject to review in this audit process generally includes unclaimed wages  vendor payments and customer receipts 
state escheat laws generally require entities to report and remit abandoned and unclaimed property 
failure to timely report and remit the property can result in the assessments of additional escheat liability  interest and penalties 
it is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of such audits 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation inflation  although minimal in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  introduction of new products and expense reductions 
foreign exchange during  of our revenue was derived from operations outside of the united states 
currency translation increased our revenue by 
based on the current contribution from our international operations  a increase in the value of the us dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately million 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of countries in which we operate impact our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables between our subsidiaries in different countries 
our largest foreign currency exposure is to fluctuations in the british pound  euro and canadian dollar  and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar 
we use foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy to mitigate our exposure to counterparty credit risk 
we regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
at december   the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts was a net asset of million 
during  deferred translation losses of million were recorded primarily from the strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the british pound  euro  canadian dollar and australian dollar 
in  deferred translation losses of million were recorded primarily resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the british pound and euro  partially offset by a weakening of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar 
net deferred translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders deficit in the consolidated balance sheets and do not affect earnings 
dividends it is a general practice of our board of directors to approve the payment of a cash dividend on our common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies 
our objective in managing our exposure to changing interest rates is to limit the volatility and impact of changing interest rates on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and interest rate swaps that convert the fixed rate interest payments on certain debt issuances to variable rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies actively hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate derivative contracts as well as our foreign exchange derivative contracts associated with forecasted transactions 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
