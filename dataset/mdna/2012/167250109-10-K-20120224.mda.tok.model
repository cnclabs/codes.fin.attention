item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding our financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends that may impact our future performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
overview we provide conceptual design  technology  engineering  procurement  fabrication  construction and commissioning services to customers in the energy and natural resource industries 
our reporting segments are comprised of our three business sectors steel plate structures  project engineering and construction  and lummus technology 
we continue to have a broad diversity within the entire energy project spectrum  with over of our revenue coming from projects outside the us the geographic mix of our revenue will continue to evolve consistent with changes in our backlog mix  as well as shifts in future global energy demand 
we currently anticipate investment in steel plate structures and energy processes projects will remain strong in many parts of the world 
investments across the natural gas value chain  specifically gas processing and lng  continue to increase and we are also experiencing increases in petrochemical activity 
with respect to technology  we are continuing to experience improving conditions in refining and petrochemical activity 
we offer our customers a range of contracting options  including cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  which has both cost reimbursable and fixed price characteristics 
under fixed price contracts  we perform our services and execute our projects at an established price 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we generally perform our services in exchange for a price that consists of reimbursement of all customer approved costs and a profit component  which is typically a fixed rate per hour  an overall fixed fee or a percentage of total reimbursable costs 
the timing of our revenue recognition may be impacted by the contracting structure of our contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts  or hybrid contracts with a more significant cost reimbursable component  generally provide our customers with greater influence over the timing of when we perform our work  and accordingly  such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of our revenue 
fixed price and hybrid contracts tend to provide us with greater control over project schedule and the timing of when work is performed and costs are incurred  and accordingly  when revenue is recognized 
the distribution of our backlog at december  was approximately cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  and lummus technology  compared with approximately cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  and lummus technology at december  we anticipate that approximately billion to billion approximately to of our consolidated december  backlog will be recognized as revenue during 
table of contents our steel plate structures and project engineering and construction backlog collectively  epc backlog comprised approximately billion and billion  respectively  of our consolidated december  backlog 
the composition of our epc backlog by end market was approximately lng including low temp and cryogenic  refining including oil sands  gas processing  and petrochemical and other end markets 
our lng backlog was primarily concentrated in the asia pacific region and we anticipate significant opportunities will continue to be derived from this region  in addition to russia and the us the majority of our refining related backlog was derived from south america and the canadian oil sands  and while we anticipate significant opportunities will continue from the canadian oil sands  we also expect to see increasing opportunities in russia and the middle east 
our gas processing projects are primarily concentrated in papua new guinea and the us  and we anticipate continued strength in the us and asia pacific region 
lummus technology comprised million of our consolidated december  backlog and is comprised of technology licenses  engineering services  catalyst and specialized heat transfer equipment for the refining  gas processing and petrochemical industries 
equity earnings relate to our owned chevron lummus global clg joint venture and are generated from technology licenses  engineering services and catalysts  primarily for the refining industry 
we have more than projects in our backlog  which are being executed in over countries 
these projects vary in size from less than one hundred thousand in contract value to more than several billion dollars  with varying durations that can exceed five years 
the differing types  size  and durations of our projects  combined with the geographic diversity of our projects and stages of completion  often results in fluctuations in our quarterly business sector results as a percentage of applicable sector revenue 
although quarterly variability is not unusual in our project oriented business  we are currently not aware of any fundamental change in our backlog or business that would give rise to future operating results that are significantly different from our recent historical norms 
in addition  the relative contribution of each of our business sectors  and selling and administrative expense fluctuations  will impact our quarterly consolidated results as a percentage of consolidated revenue 
selling and administrative expense fluctuations are primarily impacted by our stock based compensation costs  which are recognized predominantly in the first quarter of each year due to the timing of stock awards and the immediate expensing of awards for those participants that are eligible to retire 

table of contents results of operations our new awards  revenue and income from operations by reporting segment are as follows years ended december  of total of total of total in thousands new awards steel plate structures project engineering and construction lummus technology total new awards of total of total of total revenue steel plate structures project engineering and construction lummus technology total revenue of revenue of revenue of revenue income from operations steel plate structures project engineering and construction lummus technology total income from operations versus consolidated results new awards backlog new awards represent the value of new project commitments received during a given period and are included in backlog until work is performed and revenue is recognized  or until cancellation 
our new awards may vary significantly each reporting period based upon the timing of our major new project commitments 
during  new awards were billion  compared with billion for the increase in new awards over the comparable prior year period was primarily the result of several large steel plate structure awards in  including our gorgon lng train mechanical erection project in australia approximately billion through a joint venture with a noncontrolling interest partner  and an lng storage tank project in australia approximately million 
see segment results below for further discussion 
backlog at december  was approximately billion  compared with billion at december   reflecting the significant multi year projects awarded in for  our non us dollar denominated backlog was reduced by approximately million due to the strengthening of the us dollar  primarily against the australian dollar and colombian peso 
while currency fluctuation can cause significant variations in our reported backlog  these fluctuations have not resulted in significant variations in our operating results 
revenue revenue for was billion  representing a million increase from revenue increased million for steel plate structures  million for project engineering and construction and million for lummus technology 
the increase in revenue for was 
table of contents primarily due to an increase in construction activities on our large steel plate structure and project engineering and construction projects that were awarded in see segment results below for further discussion 
gross profit our gross profit was million of revenue for  compared with million of revenue for the decrease in gross profit percentage  relative to the comparable prior year period  was due to a higher percentage of our revenue being derived from our significant cost reimbursable backlog as discussed above and higher precontract costs approximately million associated with increased bid activity  partly offset by better cost recoveries from increased engineering and construction activities 
selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expense for was million of revenue  compared with million of revenue for the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to the impact of our december  acquisition of the remaining interest of cdtech  a previously unconsolidated lummus technology joint venture investment  and increases associated with our incentive plans and global business development efforts 
the results of cdtech are consolidated and included in our lummus technology results for the aforementioned increases totaled approximately million for  with the remaining increase being predominantly inflationary in nature 
other operating expense income other operating expense for was million  versus income of million for  primarily reflecting the net impact of gains and losses from the sale of miscellaneous property and equipment 
equity earnings equity earnings were million for  compared to million for the decrease was due to our consolidation of the results of cdtech for all of approximately million  partly offset by higher earnings from our unconsolidated clg joint venture approximately million due to increased catalyst sales 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue during the increase in absolute value and decrease as a percentage of revenue were due to the reasons noted above 
see segment results for further discussion 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million for  compared to million for approximately million of the decrease was due to the resolution of uncertain tax positions in  which resulted in the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and associated accrued interest 
the remaining decrease was primarily due to our lower long term debt balance 
interest income was million for  compared to million for the increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher rates of return 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million of pre tax income  compared with million of pre tax income for our tax rate benefited by approximately during both and from the utilization of previously unrecognized net operating losses 
while our tax rate may experience fluctuations in the future depending upon the geographic distribution of our pre tax income  we anticipate our tax rate will be in the range of to 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests our noncontrolling interests are primarily associated with certain projects in the middle east and our large gas processing project in papua new guinea 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for was million compared to million for the change compared with was commensurate with the level of applicable operating results for such projects  primarily in the middle east 
we expect to experience an increase in our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in future periods as our papua new guinea gas processing and australian gorgon lng projects progress 
segment results steel plate structures new awards new awards were billion for  compared with billion for significant new awards during included the gorgon lng train mechanical erection project in australia approximately 
table of contents billion and our lng storage tank project in australia approximately million noted above  an aluminum complex storage tank project in the middle east approximately million  oil sands work in canada and refining storage tank work in the bahamas 
significant new awards during included lng storage tanks in asia pacific in excess of million  three storage tanks in the middle east totaling approximately million and lng work in australia 
revenue revenue was billion for  representing an increase of million compared with approximately million of this increase was attributable to increased construction activity on our large lng tank project in australia and storage tank project in the middle east both awarded in 
the remaining increase was primarily related to other storage projects in the middle east and asia pacific 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue for our results generally benefited from higher revenue volume and better cost recoveries from increased construction activities  partly offset by higher precontract and selling and administrative costs approximately million combined  and the period benefiting from a million claim settlement in the us and better than anticipated margins on several projects executed in australia and the middle east 
project engineering and construction new awards new awards were billion for  compared with billion for significant new awards during included the full release of epc services for our oil sands project in canada approximately million  a natural gas processing plant in the us approximately million  engineering design for offshore platforms in the uk approximately million  front end engineering and design and project management services for a refinery in the middle east and various scope increases on our gas processing project in papua new guinea and refining project in colombia 
significant new awards for included incremental releases for our oil sands project in canada approximately million  a gas processing plant in the us approximately million  engineering services for a floating production  storage and offloading facility in europe approximately million  a gas processing plant in peru approximately million  development services for an lng integrated project in russia  and scope increases on our papua new guinea and colombia projects 
revenue revenue was billion for  representing an increase of million compared with our results benefited from an increase in engineering and construction activities on our refinery project in colombia approximately million  increased construction activity on our gas processing plant projects in papua new guinea and the us approximately million for both projects combined  and increased revenue related to our oil sands work in canada 
these increases were partially offset by a lower volume of lng work associated with the completion of projects in south america  europe and the us approximately million  and less refinery work in the us income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue for our results generally benefited from higher revenue volume and better cost recoveries from increased engineering activities  but were impacted by a higher percentage of our revenue being derived from our cost reimbursable projects in papua new guinea and colombia and higher precontract and selling and administrative costs approximately million combined 
lummus technology new awards new awards were million for  compared with million for the increase from was primarily due to the consolidation and subsequent growth of cdtech approximately million  higher petrochemical license awards  including a grassroots ethylene plant in russia and an award for the license and engineering design of a propane dehydrogenation unit and polypropylene plant in 
table of contents kazakhstan 
the award activity for was primarily located in north america  asia pacific  the middle east and russia 
revenue revenue was million for  representing an increase of million compared with the increase was primarily attributable to the consolidation and subsequent growth of cdtech in the current year approximately million  with the remainder attributable to increased licensing  catalyst and heat transfer revenue 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue for the absolute dollar increase from the prior year was due to increased revenue and the consolidation of cdtech in the current year approximately million combined 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year was primarily due to the consolidation of cdtech and a higher volume of heat transfer revenue in the current year  which generally has lower margins than our licenses  engineering services and catalysts 
versus consolidated results new awards backlog during  new awards were billion  compared with billion during the decrease in new awards compared to the prior year period was primarily a result of two significant awards during for project engineering and construction  a refinery project in colombia in excess of billion and a gas plant project in papua new guinea in excess of billion  and two significant awards during for steel plate structures  lng and condensate storage tanks in australia approximately million and low temperature cryogenic and ambient storage tanks in the middle east approximately million 
see segment results below for further discussion 
backlog at december  was approximately billion  compared with billion at december   as revenue exceeded new awards during the period 
revenue revenue for was billion  representing a million decrease from revenue decreased million for steel plate structures  million for project engineering and construction and million for lummus technology 
the lower revenue for was primarily due to the wind down of several projects for project engineering and construction and steel plate structures  which was only partially offset by activity on our large steel plate structures and project engineering and construction projects that were awarded in  as they were still in their early stages 
see segment results below for further discussion 
gross profit gross profit was million of revenue for compared with million of revenue for the increase in gross profit percentage  as compared to the prior year period  primarily resulted from including a million charge for the south hook project in the uk  partly offset by a favorable project claim resolution of approximately million 
the south hook project has been completed since the first quarter of excluding the net impact of this charge  our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was higher than primarily due to a higher proportion of our revenue volume being derived from steel plate structures  progress on higher margin work from lummus technology in the current year  generally lower precontract costs approximately million  and the net impact of project claim resolutions incentives in each of our sectors and cost increases on a project engineering and construction project in the us these benefits were partly offset by the impact of lower revenue volume 
selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expense for was million of revenue  compared with million of revenue for the absolute dollar decrease as 
table of contents compared to was primarily attributable to reductions in our global and business sector administrative support costs 
other operating income expense other operating income for was million versus expense of million for the period included severance costs in all of our business sectors  costs associated with the reorganization of our business sectors and costs associated with the closure of certain fabrication facilities 
the reorganization and closure costs were related to project engineering and construction and steel plate structures 
the period also included a gain on the sale of a non controlling equity investment held by project engineering and construction  which partially offset the previously noted severance  reorganization and facility closure costs 
see segment results below for further discussion 
equity earnings equity earnings totaled million for  compared to million for the decrease was due to lower technology licensing and catalyst sales in our unconsolidated clg joint venture attributable to a slowdown in refining activity 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue during the decrease in absolute value and increase as a percentage of revenue were due to the reasons noted above 
see segment results below for further discussion 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million during  compared with million during the period benefited from the impact of lower debt balances  partially offset by interest expense related to the timing of tax payments resulting from our periodic income tax compliance reviews and incremental costs during the second half of associated with the amendment and extension of our billion revolving credit facility 
interest income was million during  compared with million for the increase over was due to higher average cash balances and higher rates of return 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million of pre tax income  compared with million of pre tax income 
the rate decreased compared to primarily because we did not recognize an income tax benefit during for losses incurred in the uk  primarily for the south hook project 
the rate also decreased relative to due to our us versus us pre tax income mix 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests our noncontrolling interests are primarily associated with certain projects in the middle east and our large gas processing project in papua new guinea 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for was million compared with million for the change compared with was commensurate with the level of applicable operating results for such projects  primarily in the middle east 
segment results steel plate structures new awards during  new awards were billion  compared with billion in significant new awards during included lng storage tanks in asia pacific in excess of million  three storage tanks in the middle east totaling approximately million and lng work in australia 
significant new awards during included lng and condensate storage tanks in australia approximately million  low temperature cryogenic and ambient storage tanks in the middle east approximately million  a crude oil terminal expansion project in panama approximately million and an lng expansion project in the us approximately million 

table of contents revenue revenue was billion during  representing a decrease of million  compared with the decrease was primarily due to the wind down of two large tank projects in australia and a tank project in the middle east approximately million for the three projects combined and reduced oil sands and other work in canada approximately million  partly offset by revenue from our large storage tank awards in the middle east and australia approximately million for both projects combined and a greater volume of petroleum storage tank work in central america 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  versus million of revenue during the period was negatively impacted by approximately million of severance  reorganization and facility closure costs 
the period did not experience such costs and benefited from a million claim settlement in the us  lower precontract and selling and administrative costs approximately million combined and better than anticipated margins on several projects executed in australia and the middle east  partly offset by the impact of lower revenue volume 
project engineering and construction new awards during  new awards were billion  compared with billion in significant new awards during included incremental releases for our oil sands project in canada approximately million  a gas processing plant in the us approximately million  engineering services for a floating production  storage and offloading facility in europe approximately million  a gas processing plant in peru approximately million  development services for an lng integrated project in russia  and scope increases on our papua new guinea and colombia projects 
awards during included the aforementioned refinery project in colombia in excess of billion and gas plant project in papua new guinea in excess of billion 
revenue revenue was billion during  representing a decrease of million  compared with our results were impacted by a lower volume of lng work in south america  europe and the us approximately million and less refinery work in the us and europe approximately million  partly offset by a higher volume of oil sands related work in canada approximately million and revenue from our refinery project in colombia and gas plant project in papua new guinea approximately million for both projects combined awarded in income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  versus million of revenue during our results included charges of million on the south hook project  which was completed in the first quarter of  offset partially by a favorable project claim resolution of approximately million and progress on higher margin work  primarily in europe 
our results were also impacted by approximately million of severance  reorganization and facility closure costs  net of a gain on the sale of a noncontrolling equity investment 
the period experienced lower precontract and selling and administrative costs approximately million combined  partly offset by a net charge of approximately million related to cost increases on a project in the us and the benefit of project incentives earned on a project in asia pacific 
lummus technology new awards during  new awards were million  compared with million in the increase over was attributable to increased heat transfer equipment orders as well as greater opportunities in the petrochemicals markets 
significant new awards during included awards for the license and engineering design of a propane dehydrogenation unit in china  engineering and heater technology for an ethylene expansion project in the us and an ethylene cracking heater award in russia 
the award activity for was primarily located in asia pacific  the middle east  the us and russia 
significant new awards included an ethylene cracking heaters award in taiwan approximately million 
revenue revenue was million for  representing a decrease of million  compared with our heater supply revenue was approximately million lower in  as our 
table of contents period benefited from a higher heater supply backlog going into the year  while was impacted by lower beginning of the year heater supply backlog 
the decrease for was partially offset by higher licensing revenue approximately million attributable to an increase in petrochemical award activity 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue during our results were positively impacted by a greater ratio of higher margin licensing technology revenue compared to heat transfer revenue  a favorable project claim resolution of approximately million  and lower selling and administrative costs  partly offset by lower equity earnings of approximately million 
we experienced lower equity earnings primarily from our unconsolidated clg joint venture due to lower technology licensing and catalyst sales which were attributable to a slowdown in refining activity 
our results were also impacted by severance costs of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december   cash and cash equivalents were million 
operating activities during  cash provided by operations was million  due primarily to cash generated from earnings and an overall decrease in working capital levels 
the decrease in working capital was the result of an increase in accounts payable million for major projects in project engineering and construction and steel plate structures  partly offset by an increase in accounts receivable million from increased project activities in all three of our business sectors 
investing activities during  net cash used in investing activities totaled million  as capital expenditures of million were partly offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million 
for  capital expenditures are anticipated to be in the range of to million 
we continue to evaluate and selectively pursue opportunities for additional expansion of our business through acquisition of complementary businesses 
these acquisitions  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or may require further debt or equity financing 
financing activities during  net cash flow used in financing activities was million  primarily resulting from share repurchases of million million shares at an average price of per share  including million to repurchase million shares of our outstanding common stock and million to repurchase million shares associated with stock based compensation related withholding taxes on taxable share distributions 
additionally  cash used in financing activities included a million installment payment on our unsecured term loan see below during the fourth quarter  dividends paid to our shareholders of million and distributions to our noncontrolling interest partners of million 
these cash outflows were partly offset by tax benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation costs of million and cash proceeds from the issuance of shares associated with our stock plans of million 
effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents during  our cash balance decreased by million due to the impact of changes in functional currency exchange rates against the us dollar on non us dollar cash balances  primarily the euro and canadian dollar 
the unrealized loss on our cash balance resulting from this exchange rate movement is reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income loss 
our cash held in non us dollar currencies is used primarily for project related and other operating expenditures in those currencies  and therefore  our exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is not anticipated to be material 
letters of credit bank guarantees debt surety bonds our primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
capacity under a revolving credit facility is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
we have a four year  billion  committed and unsecured revolving credit 
table of contents facility the revolving facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan  as administrative agent  and bank of america  na bofa  as syndication agent  which expires in july the revolving facility has a borrowing sublimit of million and certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio of  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  and a minimum net worth level calculated as million at december  the revolving facility also includes customary restrictions regarding subsidiary indebtedness  sales of assets  liens  investments  type of business conducted and mergers and acquisitions  as well as a trailing twelve month limitation of million for dividend payments and share repurchases  among other restrictions 
as of december   we had issued million of letters of credit under the revolving facility 
such letters of credit are generally issued to customers in the ordinary course of business to support advance payments and performance guarantees  in lieu of retention on our contracts  or in certain cases  are issued in support of our insurance program 
as of december   we had million of available capacity under the revolving facility 
in addition to the revolving facility  we have a million committed and unsecured letter of credit and term loan agreement the lc agreement with bofa  as administrative agent  jpmorgan  and various private placement note investors  which expires in november under the terms of the lc agreement  either bofa or jpmorgan the lc issuers can issue letters of credit 
as of december   the lc agreement was fully utilized 
the lc agreement has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the revolving facility 
in the event of our default under the lc agreement  including our failure to reimburse a draw against an issued letter of credit  the lc issuers could transfer their claim against us  to the extent such amount is due and payable by us under the lc agreement  to the private placement lenders  creating a term loan that is due and payable no later than the stated maturity of the respective lc agreement 
in addition to quarterly letter of credit fees that we pay under the lc agreement  we would be assessed an applicable rate of interest over libor to the extent that a term loan is in effect 
additionally  we have million remaining on our unsecured term loan the term loan with jpmorgan  as administrative agent  and bofa  as syndication agent 
interest under the term loan is paid quarterly in arrears and  at our election  is based upon libor plus an applicable floating margin 
however  we have an interest rate swap that provides for an interest rate of approximately  inclusive of the applicable floating margin 
the remaining term loan balance is scheduled to be repaid in november the term loan has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the revolving facility 
we also have various short term  uncommitted revolving credit facilities the uncommitted facilities across several geographic regions of approximately billion 
these facilities are generally used to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees to customers to support advance payments and performance guarantees in the ordinary course of business or in lieu of retention on our contracts 
at december   we had available capacity of million under these facilities 
in addition to providing letters of credit or bank guarantees  we also issue surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to support our contract performance 
during  we had no material borrowings under the revolving facility  the lc agreement or the uncommitted facilities 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our restrictive and financial covenants  with a leverage ratio of  a fixed charge coverage ratio of  and net worth of billion 
our ability to remain in compliance with our lending facilities could be impacted by circumstances or conditions beyond our control  including but not limited to the delay or cancellation of projects  changes in foreign currency exchange or interest rates  performance of pension plan assets  or changes in actuarial assumptions 
further  we could be impacted if our customers experience a material change in their ability to pay us  if the banks associated with our lending facilities were to cease or reduce operations  or if there is a full or partial break up of the european union or its currency  the euro 
for a further discussion of our credit facilities  see notes and to our financial statements 
share issuance agreement we have an agreement in place which enables us to issue and sell  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million shares of our common stock through july  we have 
table of contents cumulatively offered and sold approximately million shares of stock pursuant to the agreement  however  no shares were sold during contractual obligations at december   our contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases term loan self insurance obligations pension funding obligations postretirement benefit funding obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations includes approximately million of minimum lease payments that are contractually recoverable through our cost reimbursable projects 
includes interest accruing at a fixed rate of resulting from an interest rate swap see above 
represents expected payments associated with our self insurance program 
payments beyond one year have not been included as amounts are not determinable on a year by year basis 
represents expected contributions to fund our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
contributions beyond one year have not been included as amounts are not determinable 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into commitments for the purchase of materials and supplies on our projects 
these purchase commitments which are expected to be recovered from our customers are generally settled in less than one year 
we do not enter into long term purchase commitments on a speculative basis for fixed or minimum quantities 
payments for reserved tax contingencies of million are not included as the timing of specific tax payments is not determinable 
other we believe our cash on hand  funds generated by operations  amounts available under our existing revolving facility  lc agreement and uncommitted facilities  and other external sources of liquidity  such as the issuance of debt and equity instruments  will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures  settle our commitments and contingencies as more fully described in note to our financial statements and address our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funding will be available  as our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our ability to access funding under our revolving facility  lc agreement and uncommitted facilities at reasonable terms may be impacted by a variety of business  economic  legislative  financial and other factors  which may be outside of our control 
additionally  while we currently have significant uncommitted bonding facilities  primarily to support various commercial provisions in our contracts  a termination or reduction of these bonding facilities could result in the utilization of letters of credit in lieu of performance bonds  thereby reducing our available capacity under the revolving facility and lc agreement 
although we do not anticipate a reduction or termination of the bonding facilities  there can be no assurance that such facilities will be available at reasonable terms to service our ordinary course obligations 
a portion of our pension plans assets are invested in european union government securities  which could be impacted by economic turmoil in europe or a full or partial break up of the european union or its currency  the euro 
however  given the long term nature of pension funding requirements  in the event any of our pension plans including those with investments in european union government securities become materially underfunded from a decline in value of our plan assets  we believe our cash on hand and amounts available under 
table of contents our existing revolving and uncommitted facilities would be sufficient to fund any increases in future contribution requirements 
for further discussion of our pension plan assets  see note to our financial statements 
we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the normal course of business and we have in place appropriate insurance coverage for the type of work that we perform 
as a matter of standard policy  we review our litigation accrual quarterly and as further information is known on pending cases  increases or decreases  as appropriate  may be recorded 
for a discussion of pending litigation  including lawsuits wherein plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos due to work we may have performed  see note to our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we use operating leases for facilities and equipment when they make economic sense  including sale leaseback arrangements 
we have no other significant off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting standards for a discussion of new accounting standards  see the applicable section within note to our financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our supervisory board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition our contracts are awarded on a competitive bid and negotiated basis 
we offer our customers a range of contracting options  including cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  which has both cost reimbursable and fixed price characteristics 
our contract revenue is primarily recognized using the poc method  based on the percentage that actual costs to date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract 
we follow the guidance of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification revenue recognition topic for accounting policies relating to our use of the poc method  estimating costs  and revenue recognition  including the recognition of profit incentives  unapproved change orders and claims  and combining and segmenting contracts 
we utilize the cost to cost approach as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress 
under the cost to cost approach  the use of estimated cost to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts 
significant estimates that impact the cost to complete each contract are costs of engineering  materials  components  equipment  labor and subcontracts  labor productivity  schedule durations  including subcontract and supplier progress  liquidated damages  contract disputes  including claims  achievement of contractual performance requirements  and contingency  among others 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known  including  to the extent required  the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress 
due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting  actual results could differ from those estimates 
contract revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for approved change orders and estimated recoveries of unapproved change orders and claims 
we recognize revenue associated with unapproved change 
table of contents orders and claims to the extent that related costs have been incurred  recovery is probable and the value can be reliably estimated 
profit incentives are generally included in contract price upon achievement of the relevant performance requirements and customer approval 
for  we had unapproved change orders of approximately million factored into the determination of revenue and estimated costs for a project in our project engineering and construction sector  but had no material claims or profit incentives recognized in revenue 
for and we had no material unapproved change orders  claims or profit incentives recognized in revenue 
with respect to our epc services  our contracts are generally not segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  if each of the epc components is negotiated concurrently or if the pricing of any such services is subject to the ultimate negotiation and agreement of the entire epc contract 
in some instances we may combine contracts that are entered into in multiple phases  but that are interdependent and for which pricing considerations by us and the customer are impacted by all phases of the project 
otherwise  if each phase is independent of the other and pricing considerations do not give effect to another phase  the contracts will not be combined 
if an epc contract also includes technology  in addition to epc services  such contract is segmented between technology and the epc services when the technology scope is independently negotiated and priced 
financial instruments we utilize derivative instruments in certain circumstances to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  as described below foreign currency exchange rate derivatives we do not engage in currency speculation  however  we do utilize foreign currency exchange rate derivatives on an on going basis to hedge against certain foreign currency related operating exposures and to hedge intercompany loans utilized to finance our non us subsidiaries 
we generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges 
therefore  gains and losses exclusive of credit risk and forward points which represent the time value component of the fair value of our derivative positions are included in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings 
changes in the fair value of credit risk and forward points  gains and losses associated with instruments deemed ineffective during the period and instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges  including those instruments used to hedge intercompany loans  are recognized within cost of revenue 
interest rate derivatives our interest rate derivatives are limited to a swap arrangement in place to hedge against interest rate variability associated with our term loan 
the swap arrangement is designated as a cash flow hedge  as its critical terms matched those of the term loan at inception and through december  therefore  changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement are included in aoci 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted income tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the final realization of deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate jurisdictions 
at december   we had a deferred tax asset dta of million related to net operating losses nol generated in the uk for which we had not provided a valuation allowance 
the uk nol dta was recorded primarily in and and is attributable to losses incurred during those years on two large fixed price projects that were completed in the first quarter of prior to  and excluding these two projects in through  our uk operations were profitable and have been since completion of the projects 
since december   the uk nol dta has decreased by approximately million  including a decrease of million for in order to realize the uk nol dta  we will need to generate future taxable income of approximately million 
given nols in the uk do not expire  and based on our historical and projected 
table of contents profitability for the uk  we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our uk nol dta 
we provide income tax and associated interest reserves  where applicable  in situations where we have and have not received tax assessments 
tax and associated interest reserves are provided in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional taxes will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide 
as a matter of standard policy  we continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and as further information is known or events occur  changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within tax expense and interest expense  respectively 
insurance we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
however  we retain a portion of anticipated losses through the use of deductibles and self insured retentions for our exposures related to third party liability and workers compensation 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims through analysis of historical and projected trends  in conjunction with actuaries and other consultants  and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a hypothetical ten percent change in our self insurance reserves at december  would have impacted our pre tax income by approximately million for recoverability of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is not amortized to earnings  but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually  absent any indicators of impairment 
our goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level  which we have identified as our three reporting segments 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of our annual impairment assessment  we elected the alternative of first performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
based upon this qualitative assessment  a two phase quantitative assessment was not required to be performed for any of our reporting units 
if the two phase quantitative assessment is deemed necessary in the future  based on future qualitative assessments  it would require us to allocate goodwill to our reporting units  compare the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying amount  including goodwill  and then  if necessary  record a goodwill impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
to the extent a quantitative assessment is required  the primary method we would employ to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit is the discounted cash flow method 
this methodology is based  to a large extent  on assumptions about future events  which may or may not occur as anticipated  and such deviations could have a significant impact on the calculated estimated fair values of our reporting units 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  estimates of future growth rates  discount rates and terminal values of reporting units 
our goodwill balance at december  totaled million  including million for steel plate structures  million for project engineering and construction and million for lummus technology 
based upon our current goodwill impairment assessment  each of our reporting units continue to have estimated fair values that are substantially in excess of their carrying values 
we review tangible and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated cash flow associated with the asset or asset group will be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment exists 
there were no indicators of impairment for our tangible and finite lived intangible assets at december  finite lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years  absent any indicators of impairment

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
one form of exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating financial statements of foreign operations primarily australian dollar  canadian dollar and euro denominated into our reporting currency  which are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in aoci 
we generally do not hedge our exposure to potential foreign currency translation adjustments 
we do not engage in currency speculation  however  we do utilize foreign currency derivatives on an on going basis to hedge against certain foreign currency related operating exposures and to hedge intercompany loans utilized to finance non us subsidiaries 
we generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges 
therefore  gains and losses exclusive of credit risk and forward points are included in aoci until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings 
changes in the fair value of forward points  gains and losses associated with instruments deemed ineffective during the period and instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges  including those instruments used to hedge intercompany loans  are recognized within cost of revenue and were not material during at december   the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exchange related operating exposures totaled million  including net foreign currency exchange rate exposure associated with the purchase of us dollars million  euros million  thai baht million and singapore dollars million  partially offset by the sale of russian rubles million 
the total net fair value of these contracts was a loss of approximately million 
the potential change in fair value for our outstanding contracts resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
this potential change in fair value of our outstanding contracts would be offset by the change in fair value of the associated underlying operating exposures 
at december   the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany loans utilized to finance non us subsidiaries totaled million  including net foreign currency exchange rate exposure associated with the purchase of singapore dollars million  partially offset by the sale of euros million 
the total net fair value of these contracts was a gain of million 
the potential change in fair value for our outstanding contracts resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which would be offset by the change in fair value of the associated underlying exposure 
interest rate risk we continue to utilize a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with our term loan 
the swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the term loan at inception and through of december  accordingly  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized through aoci 
the total net fair value of the contract was a loss of approximately million 
the potential change in fair value for our interest rate swap resulting from a hypothetical one percent change in the libor rate would have been approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which would be offset by the change in fair value of the associated underlying exposure 
other the carrying values of our cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values because of the short term nature of these instruments 
at december  and  the fair value of our long term debt  based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity  approximated its carrying value as interest is based upon libor plus an applicable floating spread and is paid quarterly in arrears
