this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
healthstream s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed and those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide internet based learning and research solutions for healthcare organizations all designed to assess and develop the people that deliver patient care which  in turn  supports the improvement of business and clinical outcomes 
our learning products are used by healthcare organizations to meet a broad range of their training  certification  and development needs  while our research products provide our customers information about patients experiences  workforce engagement  physician relations  and community perceptions of their services 
healthstream s customers include healthcare organizations  pharmaceutical and medical device companies  and other participants in the healthcare industry 
our customer base across both our learning and research business units includes over  healthcare organizations predominately acute care facilities throughout all states

operating income increased by to million for compared to million for net income was approximately million for  compared to million for earnings per share eps was per share diluted for compared to per share diluted for revenues from healthstream learning grew by  or million  and revenues from healthstream research grew by  or million 
we had approximately  contracted subscribers  of which approximately  were fully implemented subscribers on our internet based hlc platform at december   representing over  hospitals in the united states 
during  we renewed approximately  subscribers  representing a renewal rate for the subscribers up for renewal  and a renewal rate based on the annual contract value up for renewal 
during november  we raised approximately million of cash through the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering 
as of december  our cash and investment balances approximated million  and we maintained full availability under our million revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenues from our internet based learning products and courseware subscriptions based on a per person subscription basis  and in some cases on a per license basis 
our fees are based on the size of the facilities or organizations employee user population and the service offerings to which they subscribe 
revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the underlying contract 
revenues associated with online training are recognized over the term of the subscription period or over the historical usage period  if usage typically differs from the subscription period 
all other service revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered 
revenues from survey and research services are recognized when survey results are delivered to customers via either internet based reporting throughout the survey period or by providing final survey results once all services are complete 
a significant portion of revenues for survey and reporting services that are provided through the use of internet based reporting methodologies are recognized using the proportional performance method  reflecting recognition throughout the service period which corresponds with the survey cycle and reporting access by the customer  which typically ranges from one to five months 
if survey results are delivered to the customer after all services have been completed  then the corresponding revenues are recognized in full in the period such results are provided to the customer 
all other revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered to the customer 
revenues for these services can be subject to seasonal factors based on customers requirements that can impact the timing  frequency  and volume of survey cycles 
revenues from professional services include content maintenance  consulting  and implementation services 
fees are based on the time and efforts involved  and revenue is recognized upon completion of performance milestones using the proportional performance method 
we offer training services for clients to facilitate integration of our internet based products 
fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved 
basic online training is generally included in the initial contract  however  incremental training is fee based and revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 
we expect to continue to generate revenues by marketing our internet based products and our survey and research services through healthcare organizations 
we expect that the portion of our revenues related to services provided via our internet based learning products will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
specifically  we will seek to generate revenues from healthcare workers by marketing to their employers or sponsoring organizations 
the fees we charge for courseware resulting from this marketing is typically paid by either the employer or sponsoring organization 

table of contents accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured at tax rates that will be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the company has significant net operating loss carryforwards nols which management believes will be available to reduce future tax expense 
these nols may be subject to annual limitations under the internal revenue code section  which could result in the expiration of certain portions of the company s nols before they are fully utilized 
management periodically assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets  and to the extent that we believe a recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 
the company maintains a valuation allowance of approximately million for the portion of its deferred tax assets which are related to the portion of our nols associated with deductions for stock option exercises 
software development costs software development includes our costs to develop and maintain our products and applications  including our internet based learning products and our survey reporting applications 
once planning is completed and development begins  we capitalize internal costs and payments to third parties associated with the development efforts where the life expectancy is greater than one year and the anticipated cash flows are expected to exceed the cost of the related asset 
during and  we capitalized approximately million and million  respectively  for software development 
such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption capitalized software development 
a significant portion of these capitalized costs were associated with our investment in laerdal medical s avs product  continued development of our performance management and competency assessment product  as well as additional features for our internet based hlc platform and simcenter tm 
we amortize capitalized software development costs over their expected life  which is generally one to five years 
capitalized software development costs are subject to a periodic impairment review in accordance with our impairment review policy 
in connection with software development  our significant estimates involve the assessment of the development period for new products  as well as the expected useful life of underlying software or product created 
once capitalized  software development costs are subject to the policies and estimates described below regarding goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we measure goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using both income and market based models to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
our models contain significant assumptions and accounting estimates about discount rates  future cash flows and terminal values that could materially affect our operating results or financial position if they were to change significantly in the future and could result in an impairment 
we perform our goodwill impairment test whenever events or changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and also during the fourth quarter each year 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are also reviewed for events or changes in facts and circumstances  both internally and externally  which may indicate an impairment is present 
we measure any impairment using observable market values or discounted future cash flows from the related long lived assets 
the cash flow estimates and discount rates incorporate management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the date of evaluation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts using both a specific and non specific identification method 
management s evaluation includes reviewing past due accounts on a case by case basis  and determining whether an account should be reserved  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each potentially uncollectible account 
an allowance is also maintained for accounts not specifically identified that may become uncollectible in the future 
uncollectible accounts are written off in the period management believes it has exhausted every opportunity to collect payment from the customer 
bad debt expense is recorded when events or circumstances indicate an additional allowance is necessary based on our specific and non specific identification approach 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately  as of december  accrual for service credits due to the complexity of our hosted applications  variability in customer utilization patterns  changes in technology  and potential software defects  our hosted learning management applications could experience periodic downtime 
in addition  we have specific contractual obligations that can result in penalties to us associated with system performance and other commitments 
we maintain an accrual which is intended to provide for concessions due to customers experiencing inconveniences or operation disruption resulting from downtime or performance of our applications  or our failure to meet certain contractual obligations to customers 
our accrual for service credits totaled approximately  as of december  stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments including stock options 
measurement of such compensation expense requires significant estimation and assumptions  however  we believe that the black scholes option pricing model we use for calculating the fair value of our stock based compensation plans provides a reasonable measurement methodology using a framework that is widely adopted 
as of december   we had a stock incentive plan which qualified as a stock based compensation plan 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded approximately   and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
we have historically granted stock options to our management group on an annual basis  or when new members of 
table of contents the management group begin their employment 
we have historically granted stock options to members of our board of directors in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting  or as new members are added on a pro rata basis based on the time elapsed since our annual shareholders meeting 
we expect to continue providing equity based awards to our management group and our board of directors for the foreseeable future 
as of december   total future compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized was approximately million net of estimated forfeitures  with a weighted average expense recognition period of years 
future compensation expense recognition for new equity based award grants will vary depending on the timing and size of new awards granted  changes in the market price or volatility of our common stock  changes in risk free interest rates  or if actual forfeitures vary significantly from our estimates

see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for our reconciliation of this calculation to measures under us gaap 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in order to better assess the company s financial results  management believes that adjusted ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company at this stage in its life cycle because adjusted ebitda reflects net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
adjusted ebitda is also used by many investors and securities analysts to assess the company s results from current operations 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under us gaap 
because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with us gaap  it is susceptible to varying calculations 
accordingly  adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the company understands that  although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies  this measure has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for an analysis of the company s results as reported under us gaap 
for example  adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  it does not reflect non cash components of employee compensation  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  and due to the company s utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in and  actual cash income tax payments have been significantly less than the tax provision recorded in accordance with us gaap  and income tax payments will continue to be less than the income tax provision until our existing federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have been fully utilized or have expired 
management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted ebitda through disclosure of such limitations  presentation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most directly comparable us gaap measure

the number of days sales outstanding dso was days for compared to days for the increase in dso resulted from slower payments from customers 
the company calculates dso by dividing the average accounts receivable balance excluding unbilled and other receivables by average daily revenues for the year 
the primary uses of cash to fund our operations include personnel expenses  sales commissions  royalty payments  payments for contract labor and other direct expenses associated with delivery of our products and services  and general corporate expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million during and million during during  the company purchased million of marketable securities  spent million for capitalized software development  and purchased million of property and equipment 
approximately million of the property and equipment purchases during were associated with the expansion of our nashville  tennessee office space  while the remainder is associated with hardware and software to support our business operations 
approximately million of the capitalized software development spending related to the acquisition of a percent ownership stake in laerdal medical s avs product 
these uses of cash were partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of million

cash provided by financing activities was approximately million during  while  was used for financing activities during the primary sources of cash from financing activities for included proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
the primary source of cash during resulted from the exercise of employee stock options 
the primary uses of cash for related to payments under capital lease obligations  and for related to repurchases of common stock and payments under a promissory note and capital lease obligations 

table of contents revenues increased and operating income improved over the prior year  and our balance sheet reflects positive working capital of million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in working capital primarily resulted from increases in cash and investment balances  including million of cash received from the issuance of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
at december   the company s primary source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the company also has a million revolving credit facility loan agreement  all of which was available at december  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash generated from operations  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital  new product development and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
over the past seven years  we have utilized our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
we anticipate our remaining net operating loss carryforwards could become fully utilized within the next months 
our actual tax payments may increase significantly once the net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized 
as part of our growth strategy  we review possible acquisitions that complement our products and services 
we anticipate that future acquisitions  if any  would be effected through a combination of stock and cash consideration 
the issuance of our stock as consideration for an acquisition could have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and could adversely affect our stock price 
because we have no material debt or outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  our balance sheet is unleveraged 
our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and availability calculations designed to set a maximum leverage ratio of outstanding debt to equity 
therefore  if we were to borrow against our revolving credit facility  our debt capacity would be dependent on the covenant values at the time of borrowing 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all covenants 
the credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption  and we cannot assure you that if we need additional financing that it will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company s off balance sheet arrangements primarily consist of operating leases  contractual obligations  and our revolving credit facility  which is described further in note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the following table presents a summary of future anticipated payments due by the company under contractual obligations with firm minimum commitments as of december   excluding amounts already recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in thousands payments due by period less than more than year years years years total operating leases purchase obligations total recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which amends asc topic  comprehensive income 
the objective of asu is to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the update will require entities to present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements  and entities will no longer be allowed to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity
