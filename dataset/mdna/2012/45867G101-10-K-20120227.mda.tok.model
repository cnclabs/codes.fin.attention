item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto contained in this form k 
please refer to the glossary of terms immediately following the table of contents for a listing and detailed description of the various technical  industry  and other defined terms that are used in this form k 
business interdigital designs and develops advanced technologies that enable and enhance wireless communications and monetizes such technologies through licensing and other revenue opportunities 
since our founding in  we have designed and developed a wide range of innovations that are used in digital cellular and wireless products and networks  including g  g  g and ieee related products and networks 
we are a leading contributor of intellectual property to the wireless communications industry and as of december  held  through wholly owned subsidiaries  a portfolio of over  patents and patent applications related to the fundamental technologies that enable wireless communications 
included in our portfolio are a number of patents and patent applications that we believe are or may be essential or may become essential to cellular and other wireless standards  including g  g  g and the ieee suite of standards 
we believe that companies 
table of contents making  using or selling products compliant with these standards  which include all manufacturers of mobile handsets  require a license under our patents and will require licenses under patents that may issue from our pending patent applications 
products incorporating our patented inventions include mobile devices  such as cellular phones  tablets  notebook computers and wireless personal digital assistants  wireless infrastructure equipment  such as base stations  and components  dongles and modules for wireless devices 
in  we believe we recognized revenue from over half of all g mobile devices sold worldwide  including those sold by leading mobile communications companies such as apple  htc  rim and samsung 
we develop advanced technologies that we expect will improve the wireless user s experience and enable the delivery of a broad array of information and services 
this includes next generation wireless air interfaces and technologies to enhance connectivity and mobility across networks and devices and technologies that support more efficient transportation of information 
we actively participate in  and contribute our technology solutions to  worldwide organizations responsible for the development and approval of standards with which digital cellular and ieee compliant products and services are designed to operate in accordance 
we offer licenses to our patents to equipment producers that manufacture  use or sell digital cellular and ieee related products 
in addition  we offer for license or sale our mobile broadband modem solutions modem ip  know how  and reference platforms to mobile device manufacturers  semiconductor companies  and other equipment producers that manufacture  use or sell digital cellular products 
we built our suite of technology and patent offerings primarily through internal development  but also through participation in joint development projects with other companies  as well as select acquisitions 
we have formed strategic relationships with a number of leading technology companies that share our vision and complement our internal research and development efforts 
currently  we generate revenues primarily from royalties received under our patent license agreements 
we also generate revenues by licensing our technology solutions and providing related development support 
in   and  our total revenues were million  million  and million  respectively  and our patent licensing revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
patent licensing revenue made up at least of our total revenues in each period 
in  the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments accounted for approximately of our patent licensing revenues 
these fixed fee revenues are not affected by the related licensees success in the market or the general economic climate 
the majority of the remaining portion of our patent licensing revenue is variable in nature due to the per unit structure of the related license agreements 
approximately of this per unit variable portion for related to sales of product by japanese licensees for whom the majority of the sales are within japan 
as a result  our per unit variable patent license royalties have been  and will continue to be  largely influenced by sales within the japanese market 
strategic alternatives review on july   we announced that our board of directors had initiated a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives for the company  including a sale or other transaction 
on january   we announced that our board of directors had concluded its review of strategic alternatives for the company and determined that it was in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to execute on the company s business plan and to expand the plan to include patent sales and licensing partnerships 
for additional information regarding the company s business strategy  see part i 
item business interdigital s strategy 
patent license agreements in first quarter  we entered into a worldwide  non transferable  non exclusive  royalty bearing patent license agreement with acer  inc  a multinational corporation headquartered in taiwan 
the products designated as licensed under the agreement are designed to operate in accordance with g  g and g wireless technologies  including lte  lte advanced  and wimax standards 
patent license activity was affected by our july announcement that our board of directors had commenced a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives for the company 
expiration of patent license agreements in  we will recognize the remaining million of revenue associated with the samsung pla 
samsung contributed approximately million  or  of our revenue in the samsung pla covers the sale of single mode terminal units and infrastructure designed to operate in accordance with tdma based g standards  which portion of the license became paid up in  and the sale of terminal units and infrastructure designed to operate in accordance with g standards through pursuant to the samsung pla  samsung paid interdigital million in four equal installments over an month period 
samsung paid the first two of four million installments in we received the third and fourth million installments in january and july upon expiration of the samsung pla at the 
table of contents end of  samsung will retain its paid up license to sell single mode terminal units and infrastructure designed to operate in accordance with tdma based g standards and become unlicensed as to all other products covered under the agreement 
rim contributed approximately million  or  of our revenue in our patent license agreement with rim currently covers the sale of terminal units designed to operate in accordance with gsm gprs edge  tia eia and g standards  and expires on december  under the terms of the agreement  rim is obligated to pay a royalty on each licensed product sold by rim or its affiliates and we recognize revenue associated with this agreement as sales of licensed products are reported 
upon expiration of the agreement at the end of  rim will become unlicensed as to all products covered under the agreement 
in addition  we expect that a patent license agreement with one of our per unit japanese licensees will expire in during  this licensee reported million of royalties and  based on those reports  at december  had a remaining prepaid balance of million under its agreement 
once this licensee has exhausted its remaining prepaid balance  this patent license agreement will expire 
we continue to place substantial focus on renewing agreements that have expired or will expire and on expanding our patent licensee base  both with the top tier handset manufacturers and other market participants 
patent licensing royalties patent licensing royalties in of million decreased from the prior year and represented the most significant portion of our total revenue of million 
this million year over year decrease in patent licensing royalties was primarily driven by a million decrease due to the expiration of the g portion of our patent license agreement with lg electronics  inc lg at the end of and a million decrease in past sales 
these decreases were partially offset by an aggregate increase in per unit royalties due to strong sales from our existing licensees with concentrations in smartphones 
refer to results of operations compared with for further discussion of our revenue 
technology solutions we are engaged in arbitration to determine whether royalties are owed on specific product classes pursuant to one of our technology solutions agreements 
as of december  and december   we have deferred related revenue of million and million  respectively 
these amounts have either been collected or recorded in accounts receivable on their respective balance sheet dates 
united states international trade commission proceedings nokia  huawei  zte and lg us international trade commission usitc proceeding and related delaware district court proceeding on july   interdigital s wholly owned subsidiaries interdigital communications  llc  interdigital technology corporation and ipr licensing  inc collectively  the company  interdigital  we  or our for the purposes of the discussion of this matter filed a complaint with the usitc against nokia corporation and nokia inc collectively  nokia  huawei technologies co  ltd 
and futurewei technologies  inc d b a huawei technologies usa collectively  huawei and zte corporation and zte usa inc collectively  zte and together with nokia and huawei  respondents  alleging that they engaged in unfair trade practices by making for importation into the united states  importing into the united states  and selling after importation into the united states  certain g wireless devices that infringe seven of interdigital s us patents the asserted patents 
the action also extends to certain wcdma and cdma devices incorporating wifi functionality 
on august   the usitc formally instituted an investigation against respondents 
on october   interdigital filed a motion requesting that the usitc add lg electronics  inc  lg electronics usa  inc 
and lg electronics mobilecomm usa  inc collectively  lg as respondents to the company s usitc complaint  and that the usitc add an additional patent to the usitc complaint as well 
on december   the administrative law judge alj granted this motion  and on december  the usitc determined not to review the alj s determination  thus adding the lg entities as respondents and including allegations of infringement of the additional patent 
the alj has set a trial date of october to november  and has set a target date of june  for completion of the usitc investigation 
on the same date that interdigital filed the present usitc action referenced above  we filed a parallel action in the united states district court for the district of delaware the delaware district court against the respondents alleging infringement of the same asserted patents identified in the usitc complaint 
on october   interdigital amended the delaware district court complaint  adding lg as a defendant and adding the same additional patent that interdigital requested be added to the usitc complaint referenced above 
the delaware district court action has been stayed pending the parallel proceedings in the usitc 

table of contents prior nokia usitc proceeding federal circuit appeal the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit has not yet issued a decision in our appeal of certain rulings by the usitc in connection with the usitc investigation initiated by us against nokia in please see item legal proceedings in part i of this annual report on form k for further discussion of the usitc proceedings 
cash and short term investments at december   we had million of cash and short term investments 
a substantial portion of this balance relates to fixed and prepaid royalty payments we have received that relate to future sales of our licensees products 
as a result  our cash receipts from existing licenses subject to fixed and prepaid royalties will be reduced in future periods 
additionally  on april   we completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due the notes 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million  after deducting the initial purchaser s discount and offering expenses 
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering were used to fund the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the offering of the notes 
we expect to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  which may include  among other things acquisitions of intellectual property related assets or businesses or securities in such businesses  capital expenditures  payment of cash dividends  and working capital 
we currently plan to preserve a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to finance our business in the near future and will continue to periodically review our cash and short term investment position and our dividend policy  including upon the receipt of any new prepaid royalty payments or any new patent license agreements we may sign 
during  we recorded million of cash receipts related to patent licensing and technology solutions agreements as follows in thousands cash in fixed royalty payments current royalties and past sales prepaid royalties technology solutions these cash receipts contributed to a million increase in our cash and short term investments and  together with a million accrual of accounts receivable related to scheduled fixed fee payments  partially offset the million in deferred revenue recognized  resulting in a net million decrease in deferred revenue to million at december  our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances do not include million of receivables from existing agreements due to us more than twelve months from our current balance sheet date 
approximately million of our million deferred revenue balance relates to fixed royalty payments that are scheduled to amortize as follows in thousands thereafter the remaining million of deferred revenue primarily relates to prepaid royalties that will be recorded as revenue as our licensees report their sales of covered products and prepaid royalties that may be recorded as revenue upon the resolution of the arbitration related to one of our technology solutions agreements 
repurchase of common stock in march  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program the repurchase program 
the company may repurchase shares under the repurchase program through open market purchases  pre arranged trading plans  or privately negotiated purchases 
during  we repurchased million shares for million 
table of contents under the repurchase program 
we made no share repurchases during or from january  through february   we repurchased million shares for million  bringing the cumulative repurchase total under the repurchase program to million shares at a cost of million 
intellectual property rights enforcement if we believe any party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture and sell certain products and such party refuses to do so  we may institute legal action against them 
this legal action typically takes the form of a patent infringement lawsuit or an administrative proceeding such as a section proceeding before the usitc 
in addition  we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  might seek to resolve disagreements between the parties with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement through arbitration or litigation 
in  our intellectual property enforcement costs increased to million from million and million in and  respectively 
this represented of our total patent administration and licensing costs of million 
intellectual property enforcement costs will vary depending upon activity levels  and it is likely they will continue to be a significant expense for us in the future 
comparability of financial results when comparing financial results against other periods  the following items should be taken into consideration our revenue included million of past sales recognized primarily in connection with the resolution of audits of existing licensees 
our income tax expense included benefits of million and million related to the favorable resolution of tax contingencies and after tax interest income on tax refunds  respectively 
our other expense included a million charge related to impairments on our investments in other entities 
our operating expense included a million reduction to long term compensation expense to decrease the accrual rates for two of our performance cycles from to 
this reduction was driven by the impact of our strategic alternatives review process on the timing of license agreements and includes a million adjustment to amounts accrued through december  our operating expense included a million charge to adjust the accrual rate under our long term compensation program ltcp for the incentive period covering january  through december  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from these estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and are included in item of part ii of this form k 
we believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others are those relating to revenue recognition  compensation  and income taxes 
if different assumptions were made or different conditions existed  our financial results could have been materially different 
revenue recognition we derive the vast majority of our revenue from patent licensing 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements are often complex and include multiple elements 
these agreements can include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents and or know how  patent and or know how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees  cross licensing terms between us and other parties  the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements  advanced payments and fees for service arrangements  and settlement of intellectual property enforcement 
for agreements entered into or materially modified prior to  due to the inherent difficulty in establishing reliable  verifiable  and objectively determinable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements of these agreements  the total revenue resulting from such agreements has often been recognized 
table of contents over the performance period 
beginning in january  all new or materially modified agreements are being accounted for under the financial accounting standards board fasb revenue recognition guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance requires consideration to be allocated to each element of an agreement that has stand alone value using the relative fair value method 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
we establish a receivable for payments expected to be received within twelve months from the balance sheet date based on the terms in the license 
our reporting of such payments often results in an increase to both accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
deferred revenue associated with fixed fee royalty payments is classified on the balance sheet as short term when it is scheduled to be amortized within twelve months from the balance sheet date 
all other deferred revenue is classified as long term  as amounts to be recognized over the next twelve months are not known 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications 
we account for patent license agreements in accordance with the guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and the guidance for revenue recognition 
we have elected to utilize the leased based model for revenue recognition  with revenue being recognized over the expected period of benefit to the licensee 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products consideration for past sales consideration related to a licensee s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
we may also receive consideration for past sales in connection with the settlement of patent litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
in each of these cases  we record the consideration as revenue when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed or determinable price  and determined that collectability is reasonably assured 
fixed fee royalty payments these are up front  non refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee s obligations to us under a patent license agreement for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement for specified products  under certain patents or patent claims  for sales in certain countries  or a combination thereof in each case for a specified time period including for the life of the patents licensed under the agreement 
we recognize revenues related to fixed fee royalty payments on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license 
we utilize the straight line method because we cannot reliably predict in which periods  within the term of a license  the licensee will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
prepayments these are up front  non refundable royalty payments towards a licensee s future obligations to us related to its expected sales of covered products in future periods 
our licensees obligations to pay royalties typically extend beyond the exhaustion of their prepayment balance 
once a licensee exhausts its prepayment balance  we may provide them with the opportunity to make another prepayment toward future sales or it will be required to make current royalty payments 
current royalty payments these are royalty payments covering a licensee s obligations to us related to its sales of covered products in the current contractual reporting period 
licensees that either owe us current royalty payments or have prepayment balances are obligated to provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us 
we typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
as a result  it is impractical for us to recognize revenue in the period in which the underlying sales occur  and  in most cases  we recognize revenue in the period in which the royalty report is received and other revenue recognition criteria are met due to the fact that without royalty reports from our licensees  our visibility into our licensees sales is very limited 
the exhaustion of prepayments and current royalty payments are often calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 
from time to time  licensees will not report revenues in the proper period  most often due to legal disputes 
when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenue could be affected 
in cases where we receive objective  verifiable evidence that a licensee has discontinued sales of products covered under a patent license agreement with us  we recognize any related deferred revenue balance in the period that we receive such evidence 
technology solutions revenue 
table of contents technology solutions revenue consists primarily of revenue from software licenses and engineering services 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the original and revised guidance for software revenue recognition 
when the arrangement with a customer includes significant production  modification  or customization of the software  we recognize the related revenue using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the accounting guidance for construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based on actual labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs related to the contract 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs  and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when such estimates indicate that costs will exceed future revenues and a loss on the contract exists  a provision for the entire loss is recognized at that time 
we recognize revenues associated with engineering service arrangements that are outside the scope of the accounting guidance for construction type and certain production type contracts on a straight line basis  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed  whichever is longer 
in such cases we often recognize revenue using proportional performance and measure the progress of our performance based on the relationship between incurred labor hours and total estimated labor hours or other measures of progress  if available 
our most significant cost has been labor and we believe both labor hours and labor cost provide a measure of the progress of our services 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined 
when technology solutions agreements include royalty payments  we recognize revenue from the royalty payments using the same methods described above under our policy for recognizing revenue from patent license agreements 
compensation programs we use a variety of compensation programs to both attract and retain employees  and to more closely align employee compensation with company performance 
these programs include  but are not limited to  short term incentive awards tied to performance goals and cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances  as well as  prior to  restricted stock unit rsu awards for non managers and the ltcp for managers  which included both time based and performance based rsus and a performance based cash incentive component 
prior to  ltcp awards would alternate annually between rsu and cash cycles  each of which generally covered a three year period and could overlap with another cycle by as many as two years 
in fourth quarter  the ltcp was amended to  among other things  increase the relative proportion of performance based compensation for executives and managers  extend participation to all employees  and eliminate alternating rsu and cash cycles 
effective with the cycle that began on january   executives and managers receive of their ltcp participation in the form of time based rsus that vest in full at the end of the respective three year cycle and the remaining in the form of performance based awards granted under the long term incentive plan ltip component of the ltcp 
ltip performance based awards may be paid out at the end of the three year cycle in the form of cash  equity or any combination thereof  as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
where the allocation has not been determined at the beginning of the cycle  as is the case of both cycle and cycle each as defined below  the allocation is assumed to be cash for accounting purposes 
all employees below manager level receive of their ltcp participation in the form of time based rsus that vest in full at the end of the respective three year cycle 
the following ltcp cycles were active for all or some portion of the three years ended december  rsu cycle time based and performance based rsus granted on january   with a target vest date of january   cash cycle a long term performance based cash incentive covering the period january  through december   rsu cycle time based and performance based rsus granted on january   with a target vest date of january   cycle time based rsus granted on november   which vest on january   and a long term performance based incentive covering the period from january  through december   and cycle time based rsus granted on january   which vest on january   and a long term performance based incentive covering the period from january  through december  we recognized share based compensation expense of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
included in is a charge of million to increase the accrual rate for the performance based rsu grant under rsu cycle from to based on the final payout associated with this grant 
the majority of our share based compensation expense  for all years  is associated with rsu awards granted under our ltcp 
we also recognized million  million  and million of compensation expense in   and  respectively  related to the performance based cash incentive under our ltcp 

table of contents in  performance based cash incentive cost of million is net of a reduction of million to decrease the accrual rates for cycle and cycle from to 
this reduction was driven by the impact of our strategic alternatives review process on the timing of license agreements and includes a million adjustment to amounts accrued through december  in  the performance based cash incentive cost includes a charge of million to increase the accrual rate for cash cycle from the previously estimated payout of to the actual payout of 
the increase in the incentive payout from to was driven by the company s success in achieving a number of key goals  including the signing of five new or amended g patent license agreements  after we had reduced the accrual rate to in third quarter in  the performance based cash incentive cost includes a credit of million to reduce the accrual rate for cash cycle from to based on revised expectations for a lower payout at that time 
at december   accrued compensation expense associated with the ltcp s performance based incentives was based on estimated payouts of for both cycle and cycle under both the current and prior versions of the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout under the current program of  a maximum payout of under the prior program and no payout under either program for performance that falls below achievement 
the following table provides examples of the performance based incentive payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater current program maximum or greater prior program maximum if we had assumed that goal achievement for cycle would be either or less than  we would have accrued either million more or less  respectively  of related compensation expense through december  if we had assumed that goal achievement for cycle would be either or less than  we would have accrued either million more or less  respectively  of related compensation expense through december  for ltcp rsu cycles that began prior to  executives received of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based rsus  and the company s managers received of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based rsus 
under the prior ltcp program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors resulted in a payout of the performance based rsu incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the rsu payout was adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout of 
for performance that fell below achievement  no payout would occur 
the following table provides examples of the performance based rsu payout that would have been earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary 
table of contents differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters  including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable tax authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
during fourth quarter  we completed a study to assess the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryovers into the tax year as a result of the study  we amended our united states federal income tax returns for the periods to reclassify million of foreign tax payments we made during those periods from deductions to foreign tax credits 
we also amended our federal tax returns for the periods to utilize the resulting tax credits 
when we completed the study  we established a basis to support amending the returns and estimated that the maximum incremental benefit would be million 
we recognized a net benefit of million after establishing a million reserve for related tax contingencies 
in  we recorded an additional tax benefit of million to eliminate this and other tax contingencies and recognize interest income on the associated refund 
between and  we paid approximately million in foreign taxes for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our us tax obligations 
it is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures  the us government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits 
due to both foreign currency fluctuations and differences in the interest rate charged by the us government compared to the interest rates  if any  used by the foreign governments  any such agreement could result in interest expense and or foreign currency gain or loss 
new accounting guidance accounting standards updates revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in september  the fasb finalized revenue recognition guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables  the accounting standard update related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables allows companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted under this new guidance 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements or retrospectively 
we adopted this guidance effective january   and have been applying this guidance on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables entered into on or after january  as a result of this new guidance  we will recognize revenue from new or materially modified agreements with multiple elements and fixed payments earlier than we would have under our old policy 
during  we entered into one new agreement with multiple elements and fixed payments 
the application of this guidance to the new agreement did not have a material impact on the timing or pattern of revenue recognition 
accounting standards updates fair value measurements amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that is more closely aligned with the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance issued by the international accounting standards board iasb 
the issuance of this standard results in global fair value measurement and disclosure guidance that minimizes the differences between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
many of the changes in the final standard represent clarifications to existing guidance  while some changes related to the valuation premise and the application of premiums and discounts and new required disclosures are more significant 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  based upon our preliminary assessment  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements or related disclosures 

table of contents accounting standards updates presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring most entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity was eliminated 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  based upon our assessment of the impact of this guidance  the manner in which we present other comprehensive income in our financial statements will be modified upon adoption 
legal proceedings we are routinely involved in disputes associated with enforcement and licensing activities regarding our intellectual property  including litigations and other proceedings 
these litigations and other proceedings are important means to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we are a party to other disputes and legal actions not related to our intellectual property  but also arising in the ordinary course of our business 
refer to item of part i of this form k for a description of our material legal proceedings 
financial position  liquidity and capital requirements our primary sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as cash generated from operations 
we have the ability to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity financings 
based on our past performance and current expectations  we believe our available sources of funds  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from our operations  will be sufficient to finance our operations  capital requirements  debt obligations  existing stock repurchase program and dividend program in the next twelve months 
on april   we completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due the notes 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million  after deducting the initial purchaser s discount and offering expenses 
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering were used to fund the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the offering of the notes 
we expect to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  which may include  among other things acquisitions of intellectual property related assets or businesses or securities in such businesses  capital expenditures  payment of cash dividends  and working capital 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  and december   we had the following amounts of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands december  december  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to the net proceeds of million from the notes discussed above and was partially offset by million used in operating activities  million in capital investments  and million of dividend payments 
cash flows from operations we used or generated the following cash flows from our operating activities in and in thousands for the year ended december  decrease cash flows used in provided by operating activities 
table of contents cash used in operating activities during included cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of patents  non cash compensation  accretion of debt discount  impairment of long term investments  and amortization of financing costs of million  cash payments for short term and long term incentive compensation accrued in prior periods of million  and tax payments of million 
these items were partially offset by million of cash receipts from patent license and technology solutions agreements  tax refunds  and other changes in working capital 
we received million of fixed fee payments and million of per unit royalty payments  including past sales and prepayments  from existing licensees and a new licensee 
cash receipts from our technology solutions agreements totaled million  primarily related to royalties and other license fees associated with our slimchip modem core

working capital we believe that working capital  adjusted to exclude cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and current deferred revenue provides additional information about non cash assets and liabilities that might affect our near term liquidity 
while we believe cash and short term investments are important measures of our liquidity  the remaining components of our current assets and current liabilities  with the exception of deferred revenue  could affect our near term liquidity and or cash flow 
we have no material obligations associated with our deferred revenue  and the amortization of deferred revenue has no impact on our future liquidity and or cash flow

based on current license agreements  we expect the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments to reduce the december  deferred revenue balance of million by million over the next twelve months 
additional reductions to deferred revenue will be dependent upon the level of per unit royalties our licensees report against prepaid balances and the resolution of the technology solutions agreement arbitration 
at december  and december   we had million and million options outstanding  respectively  that had exercise prices less than the fair market value of our stock at each balance sheet date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash equivalents and investments the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time capturing a market rate of return 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government obligations  corporate bonds  and commercial paper 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a number of diversified high quality investment grade fixed and floating rate securities with a fair value of million at december  our exposure to interest rate risks is not significant due to the short average maturity  quality  and diversification of our holdings 
we do not hold any derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other similar financial instruments in our portfolio 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is generally limited to our investment portfolio 
we believe that a hypothetical change in period end interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
the following table provides information about our interest bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates in millions thereafter total money market and demand accounts cash equivalents short term investments interest rate cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
bank liquidity risk as of december  we had approximately million in operating accounts and money market funds that are held with domestic and international financial institutions 
the majority of these balances are held with domestic financial institutions 
while we monitor daily cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be lost or become inaccessible if the underlying financial institutions fail or if they are unable to meet the liquidity requirements of their depositors 
notwithstanding  we have not incurred any losses and have had full access to our operating accounts to date 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies  which might change over time as our business practices evolve  that could impact our operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
we operate and invest globally 
adverse movements in currency exchange rates might negatively affect our business due to a number of situations 
currently  our international licensing agreements are typically made in us dollars and are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions at this time 

table of contents between and  we paid approximately million in foreign taxes for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our us tax obligations 
it is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures  the us government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits 
due to both foreign currency fluctuations and differences in the interest rate charged by the us government compared to the interest rates  if any  used by the foreign governments  any such agreement could result in interest expense and or foreign currency gain or loss 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our short term and long term investments in addition to the liquidity and creditworthiness of the underlying issuers of our investments 
we hold a diversified investment portfolio  which includes  fixed and floating rate  investment grade marketable securities  mortgage and asset backed securities  and us government and other securities 
the instruments included in our portfolio meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
this policy also limits our amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
given that the guidelines of our investment policy prohibit us from investing in anything but highly rated instruments  our investments are not subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates for such securities 
our marketable securities  consisting of government obligations  corporate bonds  and commercial paper  are classified as available for sale with a fair value of million as of december  equity risk we are exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the calculation of earnings per share 
in connection with the offering of the notes  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with an affiliate of the initial purchaser the option counterparty 
we also sold warrants to the option counterparty 
these transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders equity 
the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes 
the warrants along with any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the average market price of our common stock for a given reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price or conversion price of the warrants or convertible notes  respectively
