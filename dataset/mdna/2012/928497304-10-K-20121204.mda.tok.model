item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed in the section titled risk factors included in part i  item a 
of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading supplier of high performance ics that are used primarily by manufacturers of networking systems for carrier and enterprise networking applications 
we design  develop and market a diverse portfolio of high performance  low power and cost competitive networking and connectivity ic solutions 
for more than years  we have been a leader in the adoption of new technologies in carrier and enterprise networking 
carrier and enterprise networks have experienced a dramatic increase in both bandwidth demands and complexity driven by the introduction of new content rich services  the convergence of voice  video and data and enhanced g lte mobile networks 
media rich devices such as smartphones and game consoles require increased bandwidth 
new enterprise deployment options such as cloud based servers and social media and tele presence have also increased demand 
these trends have forced a significant transition and consolidation of both carrier and enterprise networks to all ip and packet based ethernet networks that can scale in terms of services  bandwidth and capability while lowering power consumption and acquisition and operations costs 
these networks are based on technology that is significantly more sophisticated  service aware  secure and reliable than traditional enterprise grade ethernet lan technology 
such networks are built on new technology that is often referred to as carrier ethernet in carrier networks and converged enhanced ethernet in enterprise networks 
industry trends and characteristics that affect our business in order to achieve sustained  increasing profitability  we must achieve a combination of revenue growth  consistent or improving margins and careful control of our operating expenses 
we continue to focus on improving each of these components of our financial model 
our new products  generally defined as products introduced since  address the two largest and fastest growing segments of the communications industry carrier ethernet and enterprise networking 
many of our products also serve the biggest market within these segments  carrier mobile infrastructure  which is beginning to require carrier ethernet capabilities 
our future revenue opportunities are  in part  determined by our continuing ability to participate and capture new design wins within our major customer base 
this opportunity depends in large part on our ability to develop  deploy and sell products in a timely manner with features that compete effectively in our markets 
we compete for market share based on our customers selection of our components over those of our competitors during the design phase of our customers systems 
our ability to compete is dependent on the needs of our customers  how well our products address these needs  our corporate relationships and a variety of other factors 
once selected for a design win  we have a high probability of holding the majority market share for this product  typically for the lifetime of the customer s system 
the design win is a critical milestone in the path to generating revenue  as our products  and our customers products  are highly complex and typically require many years of development  testing and qualification before they reach full production 
as a result  it may be difficult to forecast the potential revenue from new and existing products at the time we begin our development efforts or achieve our design wins 
our ability to improve gross margins depends upon several factors  including our ability to continue to reduce our cost of materials  assembly and test  improve manufacturing yields  migrate our products to next generation process technology  and limit price erosion 
we have active programs in place to address each of these factors 

table of contents as a fabless semiconductor company  we outsource the substantial majority of our manufacturing 
we must manage our supply chain efficiently to ensure competitive materials pricing and effective lead times for the materials that we purchase 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
in periods of strong demand  we may experience longer lead times  and difficulties in obtaining capacity and or meeting commitments for our required deliveries 
today  almost all of our wafer fabrication and assembly is outsourced 
this production model provides us substantial advantages in terms of lower fixed costs  reduced cycle times and lower inventory levels 
improving product yields is critical to maintaining and improving our cost of revenues 
we have a team of engineers focused on yield improvements 
yields are affected by a variety of factors including design quality  wafer fabrication  assembly and test processes and controls  product volumes  and life cycles 
we work closely with all our manufacturing subcontractors to improve product manufacturability and yields 
we manufacture a wide variety of products  some at low volumes  which likely limits our ability to improve yields on some products 
gross margin is also impacted by the selling prices of our products  which is primarily determined by competitive factors within the specific markets we serve 
average margins vary widely within the markets we serve  with the carrier networking market having the highest average margins and the enterprise networking market having the lowest average margins 
we endeavor to increase margins by providing products that have substantial added value relative to our competition 
we also increase margins with sales from our intellectual property portfolio in the form of licensing  royalties and patent sales 
to remain competitive  we must efficiently deploy our engineering  research and development r d resources into markets that will provide our future revenue growth 
the percentage of our total headcount that is attributed to r d has steadily increased during the last three years from in to in and to in a large part of this growth is in our hyderabad  india design center where we can more efficiently design software and execute product verification and validation 
our r d costs increased from million in to million in to million in  as a result of our developing and releasing over new products 
our r d costs decreased to million in as we consolidated our r d locations to better focus our r d efforts 
although we decreased our r d costs  we have increased our headcount levels by expanding our teams in lower cost regions that have technical talent pools and proximity to our customers 
we intend to continue to focus our r d efforts and to seek opportunities to more efficiently deploy our r d resources into larger  growing markets 
as is common in the industry  we sell semiconductor products direct to oems and also use a number of distributors and logistics providers to sell products indirectly to our customer base 
product revenues from direct customer sales were million or of product revenue in fiscal year  compared to million or of product revenue in fiscal year  and million or of product revenue in fiscal year revenues from direct customer sales  as a percentage of total sales  declined in due to declining sales to our largest direct customers 
in the normal course of business  we regularly assess our product portfolio to ensure it aligns with our strategy 
at such time  we may make the determination to phase out products end of life 
when we end of life a product  we typically provide up to six months notice for our customers to make a last time buy of product and six additional months to take receipt of that product 
as a result  the end of life announcement can result in near term increases in our revenues as customers typically respond to these announcements by making last time buys to ensure that they have adequate stock on hand to support their production forecast 
in  we announced the end of life of several legacy products  allowing us to focus our manufacturing and distribution on our new products 
our accounting policy generally uses the sell through model for sales to our distributors 
the sell through model recognizes revenue only upon shipment of the merchandise from our distributor to the final customer 
because we use the sell through methodology we may have variability in our revenue from quarter to quarter as customers have substantial flexibility to reschedule backlog with most of our channel partners as part of the terms and conditions of sale 
in addition  the sell through policy requires that we include all distributor channel inventory on our balance sheet as part of our reported inventory 
our product revenues from channel sales were million  million and million  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our sales are distributed geographically around the world 
revenue by geographic region is based upon country of billing 
the geographic locations of distributors and third party manufacturing service providers may be different from the geographic location of the ultimate end users 
we believe a substantial portion of the products billed to oems and third party manufacturing service providers in the asia pacific region are ultimately shipped to end markets in the united states and europe 
in  of our sales were to the united states  to asia and to europe  the middle east and africa 
table of contents emea 
in  of our sales were to the united states  to asia and to emea 
in  of our sales were to the united states  to asia  and to emea 
realization of our strategy several years ago  we embarked on the strategic mission of re inventing vitesse to take advantage of the dramatic ongoing transformation of our target networking markets 
our objective is to be the leading supplier of high performance ics for the global communications infrastructure markets 
towards that goal  we re positioned our r d teams and invested heavily to enter new markets  develop new products and penetrate new customers in an effort to diversify ourselves and provide new opportunities for growth 
in order to optimize the efficiency of our r d team we chose to serve two large  growing  independent markets which rely increasingly on ethernet technology carrier networking and enterprise networking 
we estimate our total addressable market to have a cagr of and will approach billion by the carrier networking market includes core  metro and access equipment used for transport  switching  routing and backhaul in service provider networks 
the enterprise networking market covers ethernet switching and routing equipment used within lans in sme networks  smb  and cloud and security appliances 
while both market segments are unique  there is tremendous synergy and cost savings in terms of r d effort for ethernet switch and phy devices allowing us to address these two large markets 
within the carrier networking segment  our focus and growth is driven by mobile backhaul applications  and within the enterprise segment our focus and growth is driven by the migration from mbps to ge and ge port speeds 
in both markets  vitesse provides unique low power and low cost solutions by optimizing the feature set for target applications 
as with any high technology company  growth opportunities begin with new products 
over the past three years  we introduced over new products 
these included many new platform products and technologies that will serve as the basis for future product development 
these new products allowed us to substantially increase our served markets in both carrier and enterprise networking 
the next step to generating growth is creating market traction and design wins where we are selected by our customers over our competitors 
as we have taken our new products to market  we have seen an increase in our customer engagements and the number of design opportunities that were being identified by our sales team 
early adoption of our products by our customers has exceeded our goals 
in the past two years  we recorded over new design wins 
together with our customers  we are now preparing to ramp these new products 
in our industry it typically takes six to twenty four months for our customers to go from first product sample received to first customer shipment as customers do the necessary development work to complete and qualify their systems in the network 
in  we shipped samples and pre production on the majority of these new products  and we expect our customers to phase into volume production over the course of in  we began a migration of our revenues to our new product portfolio 
in  only of our product revenue was from our new product portfolio 
in  this grew to of product revenues 
we expect revenue from our new products to double in compared to and double again in augmenting our product revenues  we leverage our substantial intellectual property portfolio to generate revenues 
our primary focus for intellectual property licensing has been our gigabit ethernet copper phy and switch cores and efec technology 
we license to non competing third parties in adjacent or similar markets 
we have also made progress on our strategy to strengthen our operational performance and execution 
our efforts in operations include reduction in materials costs and cycle times  improved product yields  implementation of programs such as lean manufacturing  and an enhanced customer centric focus 
during the last three years  we accelerated our comprehensive efforts to increase our product gross margins and operating margins  which together have substantially increased our operating leverage 
in addition  we strengthened our cash balance by reducing inventory at september   by million compared to september  critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we base our estimates on 
table of contents historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
these estimates could change under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition product revenues in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition  we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
revenue recognition is deferred where the earnings process is incomplete 
a substantial portion of our product sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or right of return 
our past history with these pricing credits and or right of return provisions prevent us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of our inventory to be sold and the amount of inventory that could be returned pursuant to these agreements 
as a result  the fixed and determinable revenue recognition criterion has not been met at the time we deliver products allowing for pricing credits or right of returns 
accordingly  product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
we also maintain inventory  or hub  arrangements with certain customers 
pursuant to these arrangements  we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize revenue unless and until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse and taken title and risk of loss 
from time to time  we may ship goods to our distributors with no pricing credits and or no or limited right of return 
under these circumstances  at the time of shipment  product prices are fixed or determinable and the amount of future returns and pricing allowances to be granted in the future can be reasonably estimated and are accrued 
accordingly  revenues are recorded net of these estimated amounts 
intellectual property revenues we derive intellectual property revenues from the sale and licensing of our intellectual property  maintenance and support fees and royalty revenue following the sale by our licensees of products incorporating the licensed technology 
we enter into intellectual property licensing agreements that generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our intellectual property components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee 
our intellectual property licensing agreements may include multiple elements with an intellectual property license bundled with support services 
for such multiple element intellectual property licensing arrangements  we follow the guidance in asc topic  multiple element arrangements  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
we recognize revenue from the sale of patents when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectability is reasonably assured 
all of the requirements are generally fulfilled upon execution of the patent sale arrangement 
license and contract revenues are recorded upon delivery of the technology when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the timing of delivery is dependent on  and varies with  the terms of each contract 
other than maintenance and support  there is no continuing obligation under these arrangements after delivery of the intellectual property 
deferred revenue is created when we bill a customer in accordance with a contract prior to having met the requirements for revenue recognition 
certain of our agreements may contain support obligations 
under such agreements we provide unspecified bug fixes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products  or post contract support are provided 
these arrangements may be renewable annually by the customer 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months or less 
we recognize royalty revenue in the period in which the licensee reports shipment of products incorporating our intellectual property components 
royalties are calculated on a per unit basis  as specified in our agreement with the licensee 
we may  at 
table of contents our discretion and in accordance with our agreements  engage a third party to perform royalty audits of our licensees 
any correction of royalties previously reported would occur when the results are resolved 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenues to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and revenue is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable 
generally  we are not able to determine tpe because our licensing arrangements differ from that of our peers 
we have concluded that no vsoe or tpe exists because it is rare that either we or our competitors sell the deliverables on a stand alone basis 
esps reflect our best estimate of what the selling prices of the elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement  any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition  which could affect our results of operations 
in determining esps  we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors  based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
the facts and circumstances we may consider include  but are not limited to  prices charged for similar offerings  if any  our historical pricing practices as well as the nature and complexity of different technologies being licensed  geographies and the number of uses allowed for a given license 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
inventory costs are determined using standard costs which approximate actual costs under the first in  first out method 
costs include the costs of purchased finished products  sorted wafers  and outsourced assembly and test  and internal overhead 
we evaluate inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
our evaluation considers market and economic conditions  technology changes  new product introductions  and changes in strategic business direction  and requires estimates that may include elements that are uncertain 
in order to state the inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain reserves against individual stocking units 
inventory write downs  once established  are not reversed until the related inventories have been sold or scrapped 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
fair value asc topic  fair value measurements asc  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurement 
asc emphasizes that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  asc established the following fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level other inputs observable directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market corroborate inputs  and level unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which requires the owner of the assets or liabilities to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would price these assets or liabilities 
we only have one level recurring fair value measurement  the compound embedded derivative 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
financial instruments asc topic  financial instruments  defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties 
our financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued expenses 
these financial instruments are stated at their carrying values  which are estimates of their fair values because of their nearness to cash settlement or the comparability of their terms to the terms we 
table of contents could obtain  for similar instruments  in the current market 
our debt instruments are included in long term debt  net  and convertible subordinated debt  net  on our consolidated balance sheets 
senior term a loan at its inception  the fair value of the term a loan was computed using a cash flow analysis in which the periodic cash coupon payments and the principal payment at maturity were discounted to the valuation date using an appropriate market discount rate 
the discount rate was determined by analyzing the seniority and securitization of the instrument  our financial condition and observing the quoted bond yields in the fixed income market as of the valuation date 
the valuation was determined using level inputs 
senior term b loan at its inception  the fair value of the term b loan was computed using a binomial lattice model 
the valuation was determined using level inputs 
the valuation model combined expected cash outflows with market based assumptions regarding risk adjusted yields  stock price volatility  recent price quotes and trading information of our common stock into which the term b loan is convertible 
convertible subordinated debt the compound embedded derivative included in our convertible subordinated debentures due october debentures required bifurcation and accounting at fair value because the economic and contractual characteristics of the compound embedded derivative met the criteria for bifurcation and separate accounting due to the conversion price not being indexed to our own stock 
the compound embedded derivative is comprised of the conversion option and a make whole payment for foregone interest if the holder converts the debenture early 
the make whole payment for foregone interest expired october   and upon its expiration  the compound embedded derivative no longer met the criteria for bifurcation as all components of the conversion feature are now indexed to our own stock 
a final valuation was completed on october  we recorded a gain of million into earnings due to the change in value and reclassified the final liability value of million from other long term liabilities into equity 
at its inception  the approximate fair value of the compound embedded derivative included in our debentures was computed as the difference between the estimated value of the debentures with and without the compound embedded derivative features 
the fair value of the debentures was estimated using a convertible bond valuation model within a lattice framework 
these valuations were determined using level inputs 
the valuation model combines expected cash outflows with market based assumptions regarding risk adjusted yields  stock price volatility  recent price quotes  and trading information of our common stock into which the debentures are convertible 
significant increases decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement 
the compound embedded derivative is presented on the balance sheet at fair value and the compound embedded derivative is marked to market 
the change in the fair value of the compound embedded derivative is a non cash item primarily related to the change in price of the underlying common stock and is reflected in earnings 
the compound embedded derivative expired on october  as we intended to  and had the ability to  satisfy the obligations with equity securities  in accordance with asc topic  debt  we classified the liability as a long term liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of september  and september  the valuation methodologies we use as described above require considerable judgment and may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values 
furthermore  although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under asc topic  compensation stock compensation  which requires us to record related compensation costs 
calculating the fair value of stock based compensation awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the awards and expected volatility of our stock price 
expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period 
our estimates of expected volatilities are based on weighted historical implied volatility 
the expected forfeiture rate applied in calculating stock based compensation cost is estimated using historical data and is updated annually 

table of contents the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards involve estimates that require management judgment 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could change significantly in the future 
in addition  if our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could change significantly in the future 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of historical losses and projected operating results in future periods on a more likely than not basis 
if and when we generate future taxable income in our tax jurisdictions against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit  the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  new audit activity  and effectively settled issues 
determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period in which a change in judgment occurs 
restructuring charges facility in calculating the cost to abandon our under utilized facility  we had to estimate the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  and the amount  if any  of sublease revenues 
this calculation required us to estimate the timing and costs of the lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs for the affected facility and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease or complete negotiations of a lease termination agreement 
to form our estimates for these costs we performed an assessment of the affected facility and considered the current market conditions 
in determining if an event or circumstance occurs that discharges or removes an entity s responsibility to settle a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity recognized in a prior period  we followed the guidance in asc  that required that the related costs shall be reversed through the same line item s in the income statement used when those costs were recognized initially

table of contents fiscal years ended september  and product revenues we sell our products into the following markets i carrier networking  ii enterprise networking  and iii non core 
the carrier networking market includes core  metro  edge  and access equipment used for transport  switching  routing  mobile access  and backhaul in service provider networks 
the enterprise networking market covers ethernet switching and routing equipment used within lans in sme and smb networks and cloud access services 
the non core market is comprised of products that have not received additional investment over the last five years and  as a result  have generally been in decline 
the demand for our products is affected by various factors  including our development and introduction of new products  availability and pricing of competing products  capacity constraints at our suppliers  end of life product decisions  and general economic conditions 
therefore  our revenues for the fiscal years ended and may not necessarily be indicative of future revenues 
product revenue by market is as follows september  amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages carrier networking enterprise networking non core product revenues the decrease in carrier networking revenues is largely attributable to a broad based weakness in our end customer markets for carrier networking  particularly a decline in our sonet sdh products  including framers  eos mappers  and ftth products 
the declines were partially offset by increases in transport products going through end of life and in our newer technologies and products  particularly in ethernet copper phys for carrier applications 
the decrease in enterprise networking revenues is driven by declines in gigabit ethernet switch and phy products selling into low end sme smb applications due to overall weak market conditions  primarily in the united states and asia 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in enterprise processing due to revenues from switch fabrics going through end of life and an increase in new products 
the increase in non core revenues is largely attributable to an increase of our legacy network processors and fibre channel phys as some of these products moved into end of life 
revenue from end of life products totaled million and million in the fiscal year ended september  and  respectively 
product phase outs are part of our normal course of business  and we will continue this practice in the future 
we expect revenues from end of life products to decline in fiscal year however  we cannot predict the degree and or timing of the impact of product phase out on future revenues 
from time to time  upon customer request or due to a change in our product strategy  we may decide to resume producing a part we previously phased out 
we also classify our product revenues based on our three product lines i connectivity  ii ethernet switching  and iii transport processing 

table of contents product revenue by product line is as follows september  amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages connectivity ethernet switching transport processing product revenues the decrease in connectivity revenues is largely attributable to the broad based decline in the networking equipment market  which negatively impacted the demand for our more mature products  particularly sonet sdh based products 
the decrease in ethernet switching revenues is largely attributable to declines in our gigabit ethernet copper phys selling primarily into the enterprise market  and ethernet mac products selling into both the carrier and enterprise markets 
the decrease was partially offset by sales of our new copper phy products to the carrier market 
the decrease in transport processing revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely attributable to the broad based market decline for our mature sonet sdh framers and mappers  offset by increased sales of switch fabric products to customers increasing inventories of these products as they approach end of life 
intellectual property revenue september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages intellectual property revenues intellectual property includes licenses  royalties  and patents  and for the year ended september  also included the settlement of all future royalties under an existing agreement 
costs associated with intellectual property revenue are included in selling  general and administrative expenses

distributors 
table of contents net revenue by geographic area is as follows september  amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages united states asia pacific emea total net revenues europe  middle east and africa revenue by geographic area is based upon the country of billing 
the geographic location of distributors and third party manufacturing service providers may be different from the geographic location of the ultimate end users 
we believe a substantial portion of the products billed to oems and third party manufacturing service providers in the asia pacific region are ultimately shipped to end markets in the united states and europe 
cost of product revenue september  ti amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages cost of product revenues we use third parties for wafer fabrication and assembly services 
cost of product revenues consists predominantly of i purchased finished wafers  ii assembly services  iii test services  and iv labor and overhead costs associated with product procurement  planning and quality assurance 
the overall decrease in cost of product revenues is largely attributable to lower product revenues  slightly offset by a mix of products that had an overall higher cost 
our cost of product revenues is affected by various factors  including product mix  volume  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  material costs  manufacturing efficiencies  and the position of our products within their life cycles 
our cost of product revenues as a percent of net product revenues is affected by these factors  as well as customer mix  volume  pricing  and competitive pricing programs 
we continue to focus our efforts on improving operating efficiencies  including improving product yields  reducing scrap and improving cycle times 
engineering  research and development september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages engineering  research and development r d expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
r d also includes costs of mask sets  which we fully expense in the period  and electronic design automation eda tools  software licensing contracts  subcontracting and fabrication costs  depreciation and amortization  and facilities expenses 

table of contents the level of r d expense will vary from period to period  depending on timing of development projects and the purchase of masks aligned to those projects 
the level of r d expense as a percentage of net revenues will vary  depending  in part  on the level of net revenues 
our r d efforts are critical to maintaining a high level of new product introductions and are critical to our plans for future growth 
the decrease in r d expense for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely attributable to lower compensation and facility expense of million resulting from our consolidation of multiple locations and shift in activities to lower cost areas  lower mask and test wafer expense of million  and lower eda tools expense of million 
we continue to concentrate our spending in r d to meet customer requirements and to respond to market conditions  and we do not anticipate that the reduction in r d spending in fiscal year will impact product development 
selling  general and administrative september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expense consists primarily of compensation expense  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses  outside labor  and communication expenses 
the decrease in sg a expense for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely attributable to lower compensation related expenses of million  a million change in bad debt expense due to successful collection of million of the million of bad debts reserved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  million in lower legal and accounting fees  and lower facility and depreciation expenses of million due to our consolidation of facilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our market risk exposure is solely a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk our term a and b loans and debentures bear fixed interest rates  and therefore  would not be subject to interest rate risk foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the european union and asia 
our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the united states dollar  primarily the euro  danish kroner  taiwanese dollar and indian rupee 
we primarily incur research and development  sales and customer support and administrative expenses in these foreign currencies 
all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  and we are therefore subject to limited foreign currency exchange rate risks as a result of commercial operations in europe and asia 
fluctuations in the united states dollar exchange rate for euro  danish kroner  taiwanese dollar and indian rupee could result in increased or decreased costs for commercial operations in europe and asia 
had exchange rates of these foreign currencies been higher or lower relative to the united states dollar during  total r d and sg a expenses would have been approximately million higher or lower 
a relatively small amount of our monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies 
the impact on these assets and liabilities from fluctuations in related foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would not have had a material impact on our results of operations 
we outsource our wafer manufacturing  assembly and testing  warehousing and shipping operations to third parties in foreign jurisdictions pursuant to short term contracts that allow for changes in the fees we are charged for these services 
while the expenses related to these services are denominated in united states dollars  if the value of the united states dollar decreases relative to the currencies of the countries in which such contractors operate  the prices we are charged for their services may increase 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future 
currently  we have not implemented any hedging strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates
