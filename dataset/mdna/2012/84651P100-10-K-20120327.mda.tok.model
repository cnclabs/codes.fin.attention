we believe we have sufficient cash resources on hand to accomplish the enhancements currently contemplated 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  cost of revenue  prepaid advertising  web site and software development costs  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  accounting for business combinations  legal contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions with our board of directors and the board has reviewed these disclosures 
past estimates have been in line with actual results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from subscription fees 
revenue is presented net of credits and credit card chargebacks 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
revenue recognition occurs ratably over the subscription period  beginning when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred access has been granted  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
paying subscribers primarily pay in advance using a credit card and  subject to certain conditions identified in our terms and conditions  all purchases are final and nonrefundable 
subscription fees collected in advance are deferred and recognized as revenue  using the straight line method  over the term of the subscription 
we reserve for potential credit card chargebacks based on our historical chargeback experience 
we also earn a small amount of revenue from advertising sales and offline events 
we record advertising revenue as it is earned and included it in the total revenue of each segment that generates advertising sales 
revenue and the related expenses associated with offline events are recognized at the conclusion of each event 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of direct marketing costs  compensation and other employee related costs including stock based compensation for personnel dedicated to maintaining our data centers  data center expenses and credit card fees 
we incur substantial expenses related to our advertising in order to generate traffic to our web sites 
these advertising costs consist of television and online advertising  including affiliate and co brand arrangements  and are directly attributable to the revenue we receive from our subscribers 
we have 
table of contents entered into numerous affiliate arrangements  under which our affiliates advertise or promote our web site  and earn a fee whenever visitors click through the affiliate s advertisement to one of our web sites and register or subscribe  on our web site 
we do not typically have any exclusivity arrangements with our affiliates  and some of our affiliates may also be affiliates for our competitors 
under our co branded arrangements  our co brand partners may operate their own separate web sites where visitors can register and subscribe to our web sites 
affiliate deals  co brand deals and online advertising arrangements may fall in the categories of cps  cpa  cpc  or cpm  as discussed below 
our advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of each individual contract 
the majority of our advertising expenses are based on four pricing models cost per subscription cps where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based upon the number of new paying subscribers it generates  cost per acquisition cpa where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of new member registrations it generates  cost per click cpc where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of clicks to our web sites it generates  and cost per thousand for banner advertising cpm where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of times it displays our advertisements 
we estimate  in certain circumstances  the total clicks or impressions delivered by our vendors in order to determine amounts due under these contracts 
prepaid advertising expenses in certain circumstances  we pay in advance for online and offline advertising  and expense the prepaid amounts as cost of revenue over the contract periods as the vendor delivers on its commitment 
we evaluate the realization of prepaid amounts at each reporting period and expense prepaid amounts if the vendor is unable to deliver on its commitment and is not willing or able to repay the undelivered prepaid amounts 
web site and software development costs we capitalize costs related to developing or obtaining internal use software 
capitalization of costs begins after the preliminary project stage has been completed 
product development costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment 
costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of an internal use software project are expensed as incurred and certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project are capitalized 
we expense costs related to the planning and post implementation phases of web site development efforts 
direct costs incurred in the development phase are capitalized 
costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for a web site are included in expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of goodwill  identified intangibles and other long lived assets we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and test property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant decline in actual projected revenue  a significant decline in the market value of our common stock  
table of contents a significant decline in performance of certain acquired companies relative to our original projections  an excess of our net book value over our market value  a significant decline in our operating results relative to our operating forecasts  a significant change in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decrease in the fair value of an asset  a shift in technology demands and development  and a significant turnover in key management or other personnel 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in the case of the other intangible assets and other long lived assets  this measurement is only performed if the projected undiscounted cash flows for the asset are less than its carrying value 
in and  the company performed its annual impairment analysis and determined the fair value of each reporting unit and compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the market approach and income approach 
the income approach relies upon discounted future cash flows which are derived from various assumptions including projected cash flows  discount rates  projected long term growth rates and terminal values 
we used a discount rate which we believe reflects the risks and uncertainty related to each reporting unit 
the analysis concluded that the estimated fair value of the jewish networks business was higher than its carrying value and the estimated fair value of the other affinity networks business was higher than its carrying value 
at the conclusion of the analysis  it was determined that impairment was not warranted 
as of december   jewish networks and other affinity networks carried goodwill balances of million and million  respectively 
in  we performed our annual impairment analysis and determined the fair value of each reporting unit and compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the jewish networks reporting unit was higher than the carrying value as of december  and thus did not require any impairment 
based upon several valuation assumptions  including lower expected performance and lower industry multiples  the analysis concluded that the book carrying value of the other affinity networks business was higher than its estimated fair value 
as a result  the company performed the second step under the guidance to assess the fair value of the assets and liabilities of other affinity networks 
the analysis resulted in impairment to goodwill and domain names of million and million  respectively 
in  we paid the final million in earn out payments for the acquisition of the hurrydate business in the earn out payments were recorded as impairment expense based on business performance 
there were no additional impairments as a result of the assessment 
in and  we impaired approximately  and  respectively  of capitalized software development costs when we determined that a web based product failed to perform to company standards 
in and  the company determined that certain domain names and computer software acquired from prior period acquisitions had no value based upon the expected future cash flows generated from the businesses associated with these assets  resulting in impairment charges of approximately million and  respectively 
accounting for business combinations we acquired the stock or specific assets of a number of companies from through some of which were considered to be business acquisitions 
under the purchase method of accounting  the costs are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

table of contents the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful life assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income 
different classes of assets will have varying useful lives 
for example  the useful life of a member database  which is typically three years  is not the same as the useful life of a paying subscriber list  which is typically three months  or a domain name  which is indefinite 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  there may be less amortization recorded in a given period or no amortization for indefinite lived intangibles 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the value of our intangible and other long lived assets  including goodwill  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends or if future performance is below historical trends 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in the notes to the financial statements and under legal proceedings 
to the extent that a loss related to a contingency is reasonably estimable and probable  we accrue an estimate of that loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on certain pending litigation  we may be unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome of such litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and make or  if necessary  revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
at december   we had gross net operating loss nol carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately million and million available to reduce future federal and state taxable income  respectively  which expire beginning in the years for federal purposes and for state purposes 
under section of the internal revenue code  the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards can be limited based on changes in the percentage ownership of the company 
as a result of the adoption of the share based payment guidance  the company will recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for nol carry forwards resulting from excess tax benefits 
as of december   deferred tax assets do not include approximately million of these excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of the company s nol carry forwards 
additional paid in capital will be increased up to an additional million if and when such excess tax benefits are realized 
during  approximately  of net excess tax benefits were realized 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside the united states 
we have filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities 
these positions relate to  among others  transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions as well as other matters 

table of contents although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  we regularly assesses our tax position for such matters and  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
to the extent reserves are recorded  they will be utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired and or at the conclusion of the tax examination 
we believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial position or liquidity 
we recognize the tax effects from an uncertain tax position in our financial statements  only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
tax positions that meet the recognition threshold are reported at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
stock based compensation we adopted the share based payment guidance in using the modified prospective approach 
prior to our adoption of the guidance  we did not record tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our deferred tax assets in future tax returns 
the guidance requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
in and  we recognized cash inflows of approximately  and million  respectively  related to tax provision or benefit from stock based compensation 
we calculate the fair value of stock options by using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected dividend yield and the expected stock option exercise behavior 
additionally  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we used historical and empirical data to assess different forfeiture rates for three different groups of employees 
we must reassess forfeiture rates when deemed necessary and we must calibrate actual forfeiture behavior to what has already been recorded 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility 
the volatility rate was derived by examining historical stock price behavior and assessing management s expectations of stock price behavior during the term of the option 
the term of the options was derived based on the simplified method calculation 
we are using the simplified method calculation  which is derived by averaging the vesting term with the contractual terms 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we believe the accounting for stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy because it requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
segment reporting segment reporting requires the use of the management approach in determining the reportable operating segments 
the management approach considers the internal organization and reporting used by our chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
the company s financial reporting includes detailed data on four separate operating segments which were principally determined based on similarity of economic characteristics 
for the periods covered by the financial statements in this report  our financial reporting data consists of four reportable segments jewish networks  which consists of jdate

this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses  budget  forecast and compensate management 
we believe this measure provides management and investors with a consistent view  period to period  of the core earnings generated from on going operations and excludes the impact of i non cash items such as stock based compensation  asset impairments  non cash currency translation adjustments related to an inter company loan and ii one time 
table of contents items that have not occurred in the past two years and are not expected to recur in the next two years 
adjusted ebitda has inherent limitations in evaluating the performance of the company  including  but not limited to the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect the cash capital expenditures during the measurement period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect any changes in working capital requirements during the measurement period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the cash tax payments during the measurement period  and adjusted ebitda may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry  thus limiting its value as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as a substitute for net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance or financial position  as adjusted ebitda is not defined by gaap

recent accounting developments in may  the fasb issued a new accounting standard update  which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements 
the most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for level measurements based on unobservable inputs 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this standard in the first quarter of and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
instead  an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in addition  in december  the fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
the new guidance will be effective for the company beginning january  and will only impact the presentation of financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard  which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary 
specifically  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
this standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this standard in the first quarter of and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements
