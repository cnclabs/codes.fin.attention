risk factors contained in this annual report 
overview we develop  design  manufacture and service custom engineered to order equipment and systems for the management and control of electrical energy and other critical processes 
headquartered in houston  texas  we serve the transportation  environmental  energy  industrial and utility industries 
our business operations are consolidated into two business segments electrical power products and process control systems 
revenues and costs are primarily related to engineered to order equipment and systems which precludes us from providing detailed price and volume information 
the markets in which powell participates in are capital intensive and cyclical in nature 
cyclicality is predominantly driven by customer demand  global economic conditions and anticipated environmental or regulatory changes which affect the manner in which our customers proceed with capital investments 
our customers analyze various factors including the demand for oil  gas and electrical energy  the overall financial environment  governmental budgets  regulatory actions and environmental concerns 
these factors influence the release of new capital projects by our customers 

table of contents we entered fiscal with a backlog of unfilled orders of million  an increase of million over the prior year  which provided our revenue growth during fiscal as of september   our order backlog remains strong  however  the quotation to order period is beginning to lengthen 
we enter fiscal with a backlog of unfilled orders of million 
our backlog includes various projects  some of which are for petrochemical  oil and gas construction and transportation infrastructure projects which take a number of months to produce 
results of operations twelve months ended september  fiscal compared to twelve months ended september  fiscal revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal domestic revenues increased by  or million  to million in fiscal and international revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in activity in complex petrochemical and oil and gas construction projects  as a result of our electrical power products business segment 
gross profit in fiscal increased  or million  to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal primarily as a result of our electrical power products business segment 
electrical power products electrical power products business segment revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in project activity in certain markets 
revenues from public and private utilities decreased million to million in fiscal revenues from commercial and industrial customers increased million to million in fiscal revenues from municipal and transit projects increased million to in fiscal electrical power products business segment gross profit increased  or million  to million in fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  as a result of favorable operational execution and project management on certain large complex projects that were completed or near completion 
our increase in project activity in fiscal also improved our ability to cover fixed and overhead operating costs  partially offset by the challenges on certain large projects at powell canada 
these challenges resulted from scope changes and cost overruns on certain canadian projects 
we are currently pursuing recovery of certain of these costs  however  there is no assurance these costs can be recovered 
revenues have not been recognized on such costs as recovery has not been deemed probable until change orders are approved by the customer 
process control systems process control systems business segment revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal business segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is related to the mix of project types 
for additional information related to our business segments  see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as a result of our increase in revenues 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal this increase is primarily related to increased personnel costs and incentive compensation resulting from higher levels of operating performance 
additionally  separation payments of million to our former ceo were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from the impairment of the intangible assets recorded in fiscal related to powell canada 
income tax provision our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate for both fiscal and were negatively impacted by our inability to record the tax benefit related to pre tax losses in canada  offset by the favorable impact on our effective tax rate for the domestic production activities deduction in the united states 
net income loss attributable to powell industries  inc in fiscal  we recorded net income of million  or earnings of per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or a loss of per diluted share  in fiscal net income improved in fiscal as a result of increased revenue and earnings from increased activity and favorable operational and project execution in fiscal fiscal was negatively impacted by the impairment of intangible assets for powell canada of million  the million separation charge with our former ceo and our inability to record the tax benefits related to the pre tax losses in canada 
backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal the backlog for fiscal decreased slightly due to the completion of certain complex oil and gas production and petrochemical projects 
twelve months ended september  fiscal compared to twelve months ended september  fiscal revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues increased primarily as a result of the million full year impact of revenues from powell canada which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal domestic revenues decreased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to reduced manufacturing and service activities because of the lower level of backlog at the beginning of fiscal international revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit in fiscal decreased by million compared to fiscal  as a result of the competitive pressure on margins  as well as execution related challenges on certain large projects at powell canada 
these factors also contributed to the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal electrical power products our electrical power products business segment recorded revenues of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal revenues increased as a result of the million full year impact of revenues from powell canada which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal excluding the increase related to the revenues at powell canada  revenues decreased primarily due to reduced manufacturing and service activities because of the lower level of backlog at the beginning of fiscal in fiscal  revenues from public and private utilities were million compared to million in fiscal revenues from commercial and industrial customers totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to fiscal municipal and transit projects generated revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal business segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from the competitive pressure on margins  as well as execution related challenges on certain large projects at powell canada 
gross profit in fiscal benefitted from the favorable execution of large projects  as well as cancellation fees and the successful negotiation of change orders on projects which were substantially completed in prior periods 

table of contents process control systems in fiscal  our process control systems business segment recorded revenues of million  a decrease from million in fiscal business segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal this decrease in revenues and gross profit as a percentage of revenues resulted from a less favorable mix of projects 
for additional information related to our business segments  see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal decreases in short term and long term incentive compensation resulting from lower earnings compared to fiscal were offset by increased depreciation expense related to the company s erp system in fiscal  compared to fiscal additionally  separation payments of million to our former ceo were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of which million was paid in october  with the balance being comprised of deferred payments and compensation expense related to the vesting of outstanding equity based awards 
in the prior year there were acquisition related costs of million related to the acquisition of powell canada 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as a result of the increase in revenue of million 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this increase was from the full year impact of the amortization of the intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions in canada 
gain on sale of investment gain on sale of investment resulted from a million gain recorded in the second quarter of fiscal from cash received for the sale of our equity investment in kazakhstan which was previously a part of the acquisition of powell canada in fiscal impairments an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal related to the impairment of the intangible assets related to powell canada 
this impairment of intangible assets was the result of continued operating losses from powell canada and the execution related challenges on certain large projects  which reduced the company s projections for future revenues and cash flows from powell canada 
an impairment of goodwill of million was recorded in fiscal related to the powell canada acquisition 
the company s strategic decision to exit the owned joint venture in kazakhstan and delays in the anticipated growth in capital investments in the oil sands region of western canada  relative to our expectations  resulted in the impairment charge 
income tax provision our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively impacted by our inability to record the tax benefit of million related to pre tax losses in canada  offset by the favorable impact on our effective tax rate for the domestic production activities deduction and the research and development credit in the united states 
net income loss attributable to powell industries  inc in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million  or a loss of per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or earnings of per diluted share  in fiscal the impairment of intangible assets for powell canada of million  and our inability to record the tax benefits of million related to the pre tax losses in canada contributed to our net loss in fiscal fiscal was also negatively impacted by execution related challenges on certain large projects at powell canada 
the overall decrease in net income in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from competitive pressure on gross margins compared to fiscal which benefitted from the favorable execution of large projects  as well as cancellation fees and the successful negotiation of change orders on projects which were substantially completed in prior periods 
net income for fiscal was negatively impacted by the impairment of goodwill of approximately million and our inability to record the tax benefit of million related to the pre tax losses in canada 

table of contents backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal backlog increased primarily due to increased activity in petrochemical and offshore oil and gas construction projects 
some of our recent orders received were for large petrochemical and offshore oil and gas construction projects which take several months to produce  and most were awarded in competitive bid situations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at september   compared to million at september   primarily as a result of the recent purchases of land to build facilities in the united states and canada during fiscal to support our continued expansion of the offshore production markets and the canadian oil sands market 
as of september   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to total capitalization ratio was we have a million revolving credit facility in the us  which expires in december as of september   there were no amounts borrowed under this line of credit 
we also have a million revolving credit facility in canada 
at september   there was no balance outstanding under the canadian revolving credit facility 
total long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  totaled million at september   compared to million at september  letters of credit outstanding were million and million at september  and  respectively  which reduce our availability under our us credit facility and our canadian revolving credit facility 
amounts available under the us revolving credit facility were million at september  amounts available under the canadian revolving credit facility were million at september  for further information regarding our debt  see notes g and k of notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately million of our cash at september   was held internationally for international operations 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings internationally in order to ensure sufficient working capital and support and expand these operations 
in the event that the company elects to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us  under current tax laws we would incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation 
we believe that cash available and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities should be sufficient to finance anticipated operating activities  capital improvements and expansions  as well as debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to monitor the factors that drive our markets and strive to maintain our leadership and competitive advantage in the markets we serve while aligning our cost structures with market conditions 
operating activities during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was million 
during fiscal and fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was million and million  respectively 
cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our products and services and is impacted as our progress payment terms with our customers are matched with the payment terms with our suppliers 
during fiscal  the cash used in operations of million was primarily the result of increased unbilled contract receivables based on progress billing milestones 
the decrease in fiscal cash flow from operations resulted primarily from the net loss and increase in accounts receivable 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was million and resulted primarily from net income and decreases in accounts receivable  offset by decreases in accounts payable and income taxes payable 
investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
a significant portion of the investments in fiscal was to acquire land and build facilities in the united states and canada to support our continued expansion in the offshore production markets and canadian oil sands 
during fiscal  we received cash of million from the sale of our equity investment in kazakhstan and established a restricted cash account of million for the purchase of land near houston  texas  which subsequently occurred in october during fiscal  our capital expenditures primarily related to the implementation of erp systems and construction of a warehouse at one of our us facilities 
during fiscal  we paid cash of million  excluding debt assumed and acquisition related expenses  to acquire powell canada 
additionally  million was paid to acquire the noncontrolling interest related to our joint venture in singapore powell asia  which has been strategically realigned from an operating entity to a sales and marketing function within powell 
there were no significant proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in fiscal  or financing activities 
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal due to cash being received from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  as we paid down our canadian revolving line of credit and term loan from the cash flow provided by our operating activities 
contractual and other obligations at september   our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the table below details our commitments by type of obligation  including interest if applicable  and the period that the payment will become due in thousands 
as of september   payments due by period long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total less than year to years to years more than years total long term contractual obligations as of september   the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was million 
we estimate that none of this will be paid within the next months 
however  we believe that it is reasonably possible that within the next months  the total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations in various state and local jurisdictions 
we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of future cash outflows  if any  associated with the remaining unrecognized tax benefits 
other commercial commitments we are contingently liable for secured and unsecured letters of credit of million as of september   of which million reduces our borrowing capacity 
the following table reflects potential cash outflows that may result in the event that we are unable to perform under our contracts in thousands as of september   payments due by period letters of credit less than year to years to years more than years total long term commercial obligations we also had performance and maintenance bonds totaling million that were outstanding at september  performance and maintenance bonds are used to guarantee contract performance to our customers 
outlook the markets in which powell participates are capital intensive and cyclical in nature 
cyclicality is predominantly driven by customer demand  global economic conditions and anticipated environmental or regulatory changes which affect the manner in which our customers proceed with capital investments 
market cycles are many months or years in length and require our customers to analyze factors which include the demand for oil  gas and electrical energy  the overall financial environment  governmental budgets  the outlook for regulatory actions and environmental concerns 
orders take a number of months to produce  are traditionally awarded in competitive bid situations and scheduling is matched to the customer requirements which may change during the course of any particular project 
growth in demand for energy is expected to continue over the long term 
this  when coupled with the need for replacement of existing infrastructure that is at the end of its life cycle  demonstrates a continued need for products and services produced by us 
a heightened environmental concern  together with upward pressure on gasoline prices  has expanded the popularity of urban transit systems 
this should increase demand for investment in transit infrastructure  contingent upon the availability of government financing 
a sluggish global economy and uncertain market conditions in various locations around the world will place competitive market pressure on margins 
the outlook for continued opportunities for our products and services remains positive  however  the timing and pricing of many of these projects is difficult to predict 

table of contents our operating results are frequently impacted by the timing and resolution of change orders and project close out which could cause gross margins to improve during the period in which these items are approved and finalized with customers 
as a result of these issues  the timing and ultimate financial outcome on some projects is often difficult to predict 
we believe that cash available and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements and debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
during this period of economic and market uncertainty  we will continue to monitor our markets and will strive to maintain our leadership and competitive advantage in the markets we serve while aligning our cost structures with market conditions 
effects of inflation we are impacted by inflation which has caused increases in our costs of raw materials  primarily copper  aluminum and steel  during the past three years 
fixed price contracts can limit our ability to pass these increases to our customers  thus negatively impacting our earnings 
we anticipate that the inflation in commodity prices could impact our operations in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from one month to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues are recognized as work is performed primarily based on the estimated completion to date calculated by multiplying the total contract price by percentage of performance to date  based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the method used to determine the percentage of completion is typically the cost method  unless the labor method is a more accurate method of measuring the progress of the project 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience our engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in our project performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements  including our estimate of liquidated damages  if any  may result in revisions to costs and income  with their effects being recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
revenues associated with maintenance  repair and service contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
expenses related to these types of services are recognized as incurred 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also include certain costs associated with unapproved change orders 
these costs are included when change order approval is probable 
amounts are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred when recovery is probable 
the amounts recorded involve the use of judgments and estimates  thus  actual recoverable amounts could differ from original assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and continually assess the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us 
this estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
however  future changes in our 
table of contents customers operating performance and cash flows  or in general economic conditions  could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts  which  among other things  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be realizable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary 
this requires us to make long term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment  and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
the effect of any impairment would be reflected in income loss from operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets and other intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate 
intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that impairment could exist 
the evaluation requires a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss 
the first step of the test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
both steps of the goodwill impairment testing involve significant estimates 
the costs of intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our impairment recorded related to the acquisition of powell canada 
accruals for contingent liabilities from time to time  contingencies such as insurance  liquidated damages and legal claims arise in the normal course of business 
pursuant to current accounting standards  we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  as well as evaluating whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the likelihood is determined to be probable and it can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss is recorded 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability  in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
warranty costs we provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based upon historical rates applicable to individual product lines 
in addition  specific provisions are made when the costs of such warranties are expected to exceed accruals 
our standard terms and conditions of sale include a warranty for parts and service for the earlier of months from the date of shipment or months from the date of initial operations 
occasionally projects require warranty terms that are longer than our standard terms due to the nature of the project 
extended warranty terms may be negotiated and included in our contracts 
we use past experience and historical claims to determine the estimated liability 
actual results could differ from our estimate 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  based on the income tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal  international and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we believe that the net deferred tax asset recorded as of september   is realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 
if we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net 
table of contents recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase earnings for the period in which such determination was made 
we will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 
see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to the valuation allowance recorded related to foreign deferred taxes 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in which the entity is located 
the financial statements of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar have been translated into us dollars 
all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the respective period 
the us dollar results that arise from such translation  as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long term investment nature  are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
derivative financial instruments as part of managing our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we periodically utilize foreign exchange forward contracts 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable  accounts payable and forecasted cash transactions 
these contracts are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  which is based upon an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow model that takes into account the present value of the future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information  such as foreign currency spot and forward rates  as of the reporting date 
we formally document our hedging relationships  including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
when the hedged item affects the consolidated statement of operations  the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is reported on the same line in the consolidated statements of operations as the hedged item 
in addition  any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges is reported in the consolidated statements of operations as the changes occur 
if it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  or it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur  we discontinue hedge accounting and any unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we provide qualitative disclosures regarding the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments and engaging in hedging activities in the context of our overall risk exposure  quantitative disclosure in tabular format of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
new accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb  which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  management believes that the impact of recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on our consolidated statements upon adoption 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this update requires new disclosures about significant transfers of assets and liabilities between level and level of the fair value hierarchy including the reasons for these transfers and the reasons for any transfers in or out of level this update also requires a reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
in addition to these new 
table of contents disclosure requirements  this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements 
for example  this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities  rather than each major category of assets or liabilities 
this update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements 
this update became effective for us with the interim and annual reporting period beginning after december   our fiscal year  except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis  which became effective for us with the interim and annual reporting period beginning after december   our fiscal year we were not required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes 
other than requiring additional disclosures  adoption of this update has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued accounting guidance related to fair value measurement  which amends current guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this guidance generally represents clarification of fair value measurement standards  but also includes instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value of disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we will adopt this guidance for our fiscal year beginning october  we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements 
entities are required to present total comprehensive income either in a single  continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
under the single statement approach  entities must include the components of net income  a total for net income  the components of other comprehensive income and a total for comprehensive income 
under the two statement approach  entities must report an income statement and  immediately following  a statement of other comprehensive income 
under either method  entities must display adjustments for items reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in both net income and other comprehensive income 
the provisions for this guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt this guidance for our fiscal year beginning october  in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment 
under this guidance  an entity would be allowed to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
this new guidance includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   our fiscal early adoption is permitted  however  we will not adopt this guidance until october  this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued an accounting standards update regarding the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
under this update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if any entity concludes otherwise  it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment testing by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 
an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
this update is effective for annual and interim tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   our fiscal year early adoption is permitted  however  we will not adopt this guidance until october  this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial position 
in august  the sec adopted a rule mandated by the dodd frank act to require companies to publicly disclose their use of conflict minerals that originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country 
the final rule applies to a company that uses minerals including tantalum  tin  gold or tungsten 
the final rule requires companies to provide disclosure on a new form filed with the sec  with the first specialized disclosure report due on may   for the calendar year  and annually on may each year thereafter 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk 
table of contents if we decide to borrow under one of our credit facilities  we will be subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our floating rate bank credit facility 
if we were to make such borrowings  a hypothetical basis point increase in variable interest rates may result in a material impact to our financial statements 
while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency transaction risk we have operations that expose us to currency risk in the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective currencies or us dollars 
our international operations are financed utilizing local credit facilities denominated in local currencies 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies 
a unfavorable change in the us dollar exchange rate  relative to other functional currencies in which we operate  would not materially impact our consolidated balance sheet at september  during fiscal and fiscal  we entered into eight foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of future cash flows on certain long term contracts that are denominated in the british pound sterling 
the contracts were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
the changes in fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
at september   all foreign currency forward contracts have been settled  with no balances recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to these transactions
