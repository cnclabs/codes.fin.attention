the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in part ii  item of this report 
overview we are the leading independent provider of enterprise data integration and data quality software and services 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses for our enterprise data integration software products  including product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  and from sales of services  which consist of maintenance  consulting  education  and subscription services 
we receive revenues from licensing our products under perpetual licenses directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors  and oems in the united states and internationally 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services  and education services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly or indirectly 
we also receive a small but increasing amount of revenues from our customers and partners under subscription based licenses for a variety of cloud and address validation offerings 
most of our international sales have been in europe  and revenues outside of europe and north america have comprised less than of total consolidated revenues during the past three years 
we license our software and provide services to many industry sectors  including  but not limited to  energy and utilities  financial services  healthcare  high technology  insurance  manufacturing  public sector  retail  services  telecommunications  and transportation 
we grew our total revenues in by to million compared to million in license revenues grew by to million from million on a year over year basis 
our growth in license revenues reflects the continued market acceptance of our products for broader data integration projects  growth in our core data warehousing business  and growth 
table of contents in our ongoing compliance program 
service revenues increased by year over year due to a growth in maintenance revenues and a increase in consulting  education  and subscription services 
the maintenance revenue growth was attributable to the increased size of our installed customer base  and the increase in consulting  education  and subscription services was due to higher customer demand and increased subscriptions 
our operating income as a percentage of revenues increased slightly to in from in due to our dynamic market  we face both significant opportunities and challenges  and as such  we focus on the following key factors macroeconomic conditions the united states and many foreign economies continue to experience uncertainty driven by varying macroeconomic conditions 
although some of these economies have shown signs of improvement  macroeconomic recovery remains uneven 
uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and associated global economic conditions have resulted in extreme volatility in credit  equity  and foreign currency markets  particularly with respect to the european sovereign debt markets and potential ramifications of the recent us debt issues  budget concerns  and potential delays in approving the us budget 
such uncertainty and associated conditions have also resulted in volatility in various vertical markets  particularly the financial services and public sectors  which are typically two of the larger vertical segments that we serve 
furthermore  we have made incremental investments in asia pacific and latin america  and have maintained a high level of investments in europe  the middle east  and africa emea 
there are significant risks with overseas investments  and our growth prospects in these regions are uncertain 
competition inherent in our industry are risks arising from competition with existing software solutions  including solutions from ibm  oracle  and sap  technological advances from other vendors  and the perception of cost savings by solving data integration challenges through customer hand coding development resources 
our prospective customers may view these alternative solutions as more attractive than our offerings 
additionally  the consolidation activity in our industry pose challenges as competitors market a broader suite of software products or solutions to our existing or prospective customers 
product introductions and enhancements to address the expanding data integration and data quality needs of our customers and prospective customers  we introduce new products and technology enhancements on a regular basis  including products we acquire 
the introduction of new products  integration of acquired products and enhancement of existing products  is a complex process involving inherent risks  and to which we devote significant resources 
we cannot predict the impact of new or enhanced products on our overall sales and we may not generate sufficient revenues to justify their costs 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations historically  purchasing patterns in the software industry have followed quarterly and seasonal trends and are likely to do so in the future 
specifically  it is normal for us to recognize a substantial portion of our new license orders in the last month of each quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks or days of each quarter  though such fluctuations are mitigated somewhat by recognition of backlog orders 
in recent years  the fourth quarter has had the highest level of license revenues and license orders  and we generally had weaker demand for our software products and services in the first and third quarters of the year 
fiscal and the first  second  and fourth quarters of followed these seasonal trends 
however  license revenues in the third quarter of were essentially flat with the second quarter 
the continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions make our historical seasonal trends more difficult to predict 
to address these factors  we focus on a number of key initiatives  including certain cost containment measures  the strengthening of our partnerships  the broadening of our distribution capability worldwide  the enablement of our sales force and distribution channel to sell new products and technologies  and strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  products  and technologies 
if we are unable to execute these key initiatives successfully  we may not be able to sustain the growth rates we have experienced recently 
we concentrate on maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our existing strategic partners and building relationships with additional strategic partners 
these partners include systems integrators  resellers and distributors  and strategic technology partners  including enterprise application providers  database vendors  and enterprise information integration vendors  in the united states and internationally 
for example  we are partners with cloudera  dun bradstreet  emc  hewlett packard  intel  microsoft  microstrategy  netsuite  oracle  salesforce 
com  sap  and symantec  among others 
see risk factors we rely on our relationships with our strategic partners 
if we do not maintain and strengthen these relationships  our ability to generate revenue and control expenses could be adversely affected  which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock in part i  item a of this report 
we have broadened our distribution efforts  and we have continued to expand our sales both in terms of traditional data warehousing products and more strategic data integration solutions beyond data warehousing  including enterprise data integration  
table of contents data quality  master data management  bb data exchange  application information lifecycle management  complex event processing  ultra messaging  and cloud data integration 
we also operate the informatica marketplace  which allows buyers and sellers to share and leverage data integration solutions 
to address the risks of introducing new products  we have continued to invest in programs to help train our internal sales force and our external distribution channel on new product functionalities  key differentiators  and key business values 
these programs include user conferences for customers and partners  our annual sales kickoff conference for all sales and key marketing personnel  webinars and other informational seminars and materials for our direct sales force and indirect distribution channel  in person technical seminars for our pre sales consultants  the building of product demonstrations  and creation and distribution of targeted marketing collateral 
additionally  we have expanded our international sales presence in recent years by opening new offices  increasing headcount  and through acquisitions 
as a result of this international expansion  as well as the increase in our direct sales headcount in the united states  our sales and marketing expenses have increased 
in the long term  we expect these investments to result in increased revenues and productivity and ultimately higher profitability 
if we experience an increase in sales personnel turnover  do not achieve expected increases in our sales pipeline  experience a decline in our sales pipeline conversion ratio  or do not achieve increases in sales productivity and efficiencies from our new sales personnel as they gain more experience  then it is unlikely that we will achieve our expected increases in revenue  sales productivity  or profitability from our international operations 
while we have not yet achieved the same level of sales productivity internationally as we have in the united states  we did experience a slight increase in international sales productivity in for further discussion regarding these and related risks  see risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states  which require us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments  and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these assumptions  judgments  and estimates are made 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any material differences between these estimates and actual results will impact our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  judgments  and assumptions and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the estimates  judgments  and assumptions involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  facilities restructuring charges  income taxes  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  business combinations  share based compensation  and allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our estimates  judgments  and assumptions relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further information on our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of such rules 
these rules and their interpretations are often subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition process requires management to make significant judgments  for example  to determine if collectability is probable 
we derive revenues from software license fees  maintenance fees which entitle the customer to receive product support and unspecified software updates  professional services  consisting of consulting and education services  and other revenues  primarily consisting of subscriptions for address validation and cloud services 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
the basis for recognizing software license revenue is determined by software revenue recognition asc  revenue recognition for construction type and production type contracts asc  and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which is discussed in the subsection revenue recognition in note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
substantially all of our software licenses are perpetual licenses under which the customer acquires the perpetual right to use the software as provided and subject to the conditions of the license agreement 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of software  maintenance  and professional services revenue to be recognized at each period 

table of contents we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer contracts and exercise judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
we consider factors including extended payment terms  financing arrangements  the category of customer end user customer or reseller  rights of return or refund  and our history of enforcing the terms and conditions of customer contracts 
if the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt  whichever is earlier 
we require evidence of sell through from resellers and distributors for order acceptance 
we then recognize revenue from resellers and distributors upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met  which in substantially all cases is when cash is collected or when the reseller or distributor is deemed credit worthy based on their payment history and credit profile to conclude that collectability is probable 
further  we make judgments in determining the collectability of the amounts due from our customers that could possibly impact the timing of revenue recognition 
we assess credit worthiness and collectability  and when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
our software license arrangements include the following multiple elements license fees from our core software products and or product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  maintenance fees  consulting  and or education services 
we use the residual method to recognize license revenue upon delivery when the arrangement includes elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered software product element of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered  or vsoe is established 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered services elements of the arrangement  all revenue is recognized ratably over the period that the services are expected to be performed 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining if vsoe exists for each undelivered element 
consulting services  if included as part of the software arrangement  generally do not require significant modification or customization of the software 
if  in our judgment  the software arrangement includes significant modification or customization of the software  then software license revenue is recognized as the consulting services revenue is recognized 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation of services and product configurations 
these services are performed on a time and materials basis and  occasionally  on a fixed fee basis 
revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed 
if uncertainty exists about our ability to complete the project  our ability to collect the amounts due  or in the case of fixed fee consulting arrangements  our ability to estimate the remaining costs to be incurred to complete the project  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
other revenues  primarily consisting of subscriptions for address validation and cloud services  are recognized as the services are delivered 
multiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement 
we recognize revenues net of applicable sales taxes  financing charges that we have absorbed  and amounts retained by our resellers and distributors  if any 
our agreements do not permit returns  and historically we have not had any significant returns or refunds  therefore  we have not established a sales return reserve at this time 
multiple element arrangements nonsoftware arrangements or arrangements with software and nonsoftware elements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amended the accounting standards applicable to revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that are outside the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
the new guidance amends the criteria for allocating the consideration in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the guidance also eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and requires that the arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we adopted this guidance on a prospective basis on january   and therefore  it is applicable to relevant revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after that date 
our multiple element arrangements are primarily software or software related  which are excluded from the new guidance 
multiple element arrangements that include non software related elements and software or software related elements  which are included in the new guidance  are not material to date 

table of contents for multiple element arrangements that include software and non software related elements  for example  on site software licenses sold together with subscriptions for our cloud and hosted address validation services  we allocate revenue to each software and non software element as a group based upon the relative selling price of each in accordance with the selling price hierarchy  which includes i vsoe if available  ii tpe if vsoe is not available  and iii esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
the manner in which we account for multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software related elements remains unchanged 
in certain limited instances  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements 
this may be due to the infrequent selling of each element separately  not pricing products or services within a narrow range  or only having a limited sales history 
when vsoe cannot be established  we attempt to establish a selling price based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of the arrangement consideration 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering both market conditions and entity specific factors 
this includes  but is not limited to  geographies  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  and pricing practices 
given the nature of our transactions  which are primarily software or software related  the adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have a significant impact on the timing and pattern of revenue recognition when applied to multiple element arrangements 
total net revenue as reported during the year ended december  is materially consistent with total net revenue that would have been reported if the transaction entered into or materially modified after december  were subject to previous accounting guidance 
the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition  if applied in the same manner to the year ended december   would not have had a material impact on total net revenues for the fiscal year facilities restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded significant charges restructuring plan related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  to take advantage of more favorable lease terms and reduce our operating expenses 
the accrued restructuring charges represent the net present value of lease obligations and estimated broker commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by actual and estimated gross sublease income  which is net of estimated broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances  expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 
in addition  we significantly increased the restructuring charges restructuring plan in the third and fourth quarters of due to changes in our assumptions used to calculate the original charges as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters 
in february  we purchased the property associated with our former corporate headquarters in redwood city  california for approximately million in cash  which reflects a purchase price of million less a rent credit of million 
as a result of the transaction  we will no longer have any further commitments relating to the original lease agreements  under which we were responsible for future payments of approximately million 
we will continue to receive rental payments from our tenants of approximately million as the owner of the buildings  which include rental income and reimbursement of certain property costs such as common area maintenance  insurance  and property taxes  through the remainder of their respective lease terms 
the purchase of the buildings discharges our future lease obligations that were previously accounted for under our and restructuring plans 
as a result  in the first quarter of we expect to reverse our accrued facilities restructuring liability of million  which will result in a corresponding facilities restructuring benefit on the consolidated statement of income 
during the first quarter of  we also expect to record a charge of approximately million representing the cost to terminate the operating lease in the consolidated statements of income 
the amount of sublease income we expect to receive during and include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions periodically to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the global economic downturn  time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases  and market rates at the time of subleases 
currently  we have subleased our excess facilities through july future adjustments to the estimates could result from any default by a sublessor  which could impact the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  and expected sublease terms 
see note facilities restructuring charges and note subsequent event of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of any future changes in tax laws or rates have not been taken into account 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable  and to the extent we believe that a deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for any additional valuation allowance  we considered all the evidence available to us  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  legislative developments  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
accounting for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we assess goodwill for impairment annually on october of each year and whenever an event or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit and goodwill for impairment at the entity level 
we test goodwill using the two step process required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
in the first step  we compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  goodwill is potentially impaired and the second step of the impairment test must be performed 
in the second step  if such comparison reflects potential impairment  we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by asc  to its carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests on october    and and concluded that there was no impairment 
we evaluate intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
we measure any amount of impairment based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we did not recognize any impairment charges of long lived assets in   or we have made assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives which are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe that the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
business combinations we record the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
the valuation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities  and pre acquisition contingencies 
we expense transaction costs and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition as incurred and identify pre acquisition contingencies and determine their respective fair values as of the end of the measurement period 
we record any adjustments to pre acquisition contingencies in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
furthermore  any adjustments to estimates of acquisition related tax contingencies are recorded to goodwill during the measurement period and in our operating results after the conclusion of the measurement period 
moreover  we identify in process research and development costs  determine their respective fair values and classify them as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the asset is put to use or deemed to be impaired 
accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions that we have made are reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical 
table of contents experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
the following are some of the examples of critical estimates that we have applied in our acquisitions future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions 
in connection with our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations 
the sum of these costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligations 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc  stock compensation 
share based awards granted include stock options  restricted stock units rsus  and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as an expense ratably on a straight line basis over its requisite service period 
it requires a certain amount of judgment to select the appropriate fair value model and calculate the fair value of share based awards  including estimating stock price volatility and expected life 
further  estimates of forfeiture rates could shift share based compensation expense from one period to the next 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our current estimate of volatility is based upon a blend of average historical and market based implied volatilities of our stock price 
our volatility rates were   and for   and  respectively 
the increase in volatility rates in from was due to an increase in the implied components of our volatility rates 
the decrease in volatility rates in from was due to a decline in the implied components of our volatility rates 
our historical volatility remained relatively unchanged in compared to and decreased slightly in compared to our implied volatility rates increased in compared to and decreased in compared to to the extent that the volatility rate in our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted will increase accordingly 
we do not expect that changes in the volatility rates to impact our future share based compensation expense materially due to the limited amount of recent option grants 
we derived our expected life of the options that we granted in from the historical option exercises  post vesting cancellations  and estimates concerning future exercises and cancellations for vested and unvested options that remain outstanding 
we increased our expected life estimate from years in to years in the higher expected life of options was mainly due to lower cancellations in we do not expect that changes in the expected life to impact our future share based compensation expense materially due to the limited amount of recent option grants 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate in determining the amount of share based compensation 
we use historical forfeitures to estimate our future forfeiture rates 
we increased our forfeiture rate for stock options from in to in and while the total number of stock options forfeited was relatively consistent  the number of stock options granted to employees decreased 
the impact on our share based compensation for due to the change in our forfeiture rate was negligible 
the forfeiture rate for rsus remained at for   and we believe that the estimates that we have used for the calculation of the variables to arrive at share based compensation expense are reasonable and appropriate 
the assumptions entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our share based awards are subjective estimates  and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our share based awards and related share based compensation expense that we record to vary 
we will continue to monitor the historical performance of these variables and will modify our methodology and assumptions in the future as needed 
see note share based compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for a description of the company s share based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of share based compensation

the increase of million or in from was primarily due to an increase in international license revenues in europe and asia pacific and an increase in maintenance revenue in all major geographic regions as a result of a larger and growing installed customer base 
we expect our international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in to be relatively consistent with the comparable levels 
potential future revenues new orders  backlog  and deferred revenues our potential future revenues include backlog consisting primarily of product orders both on a perpetual and subscription basis that have not shipped as of the end of a given quarter  product orders received from certain distributors  resellers  oems  and end users not included in deferred revenues  where revenue is recognized after cash receipt collectively and above are referred as aggregate backlog  and deferred revenues 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of the following maintenance revenues that we recognize over the term of the contract  typically one year  license product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the license agreement contain acceptance language or other terms that require that the license revenues be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met or recognized ratably over an extended period  and consulting and education services revenues that have been prepaid but for which services have not yet been performed 
we typically ship products shortly after the receipt of an order  which is common in the software industry  and historically our backlog of license orders awaiting shipment at the end of any given quarter has varied 
however  our backlog historically decreases from the prior quarter at the end of the first and third quarters and increases at the end of the fourth quarter 
aggregate backlog and deferred revenues at december  were approximately million compared to million at december  the increase in was primarily due to an increase in deferred maintenance revenues 
the international portion of aggregate backlog and deferred revenues may fluctuate with changes in foreign currency exchange rates

we have not provided for residual us taxes in all of these lower tax jurisdictions since we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings offshore with the exception of israel 
the effective tax rate of for differed from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to benefits of certain earnings from operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world  the recognition of current year research and development credits  and a prior year tax return true up offset by compensation expense related to non deductible share based compensation and the accrual of reserves related to uncertain tax positions 
we have not provided for residual us taxes in all of these lower tax jurisdictions since we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings offshore

we are a united states based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our netherlands subsidiaries 
our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions 
any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 
our effective tax rate in will be highly dependent on the result of our international operations  the execution of business combinations  the outcome of various tax audits  and the possibility of changes in tax law 
for example  our effective tax rate has benefited from an existing us research and development tax credit 
if this tax credit is not renewed for or in the future  we would expect our effective tax rate to increase 
asc  income taxes  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
in assessing the need for any additional valuation allowance in  we considered all available evidence both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  legislative developments  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
as a result of this analysis for the year ended december   consistent with prior years  it was considered more likely than not that our non share based payments related deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  the remaining valuation allowance is primarily related to deferred tax assets that were created through the benefit from stock option deductions on a with and without basis and recorded on the balance sheet with a corresponding valuation allowance prior to our adoption of asc  stock compensation 
pursuant to asc  the benefit of these deferred tax assets will be recorded in stockholders equity when they are utilized on an income tax return to reduce our taxes payable  and as such  they will not impact our effective tax rate

although we expect to continue to receive some proceeds from the issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors  including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan  and overall market conditions 
our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock 
purchases can be made from time to time in the open market and will be funded from our available cash 
the primary purpose of these programs is to enhance shareholder value  including to partially offset the dilutive impact of stock based incentive plans 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases are based on several factors  including the price of our common stock  our liquidity and working capital needs  general business and market conditions  and other investment opportunities 
the repurchased shares are retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock

as of march   none of the notes were outstanding 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may be required to raise or desire additional funds for selective purposes  such as acquisitions or other investments in complementary businesses  products  or technologies  and may raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
less than of our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from foreign operations  and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations 
in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if us tax has not already been previously provided  we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds

as a result  this amount is not included in the table above 
for further information  see note income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the preceding table 
we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements

our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above

we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based on existing sublease agreements and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
in february  we entered into lease agreements for two office buildings located at and seaport boulevard in redwood city  california  which we occupied from august through december as our former corporate headquarters 
these lease agreements expire in july as a result of the restructuring plan  we relocated our corporate headquarters and subsequently entered into a series of sublease agreements with tenants to occupy a portion of the vacated space

we will continue to receive rental payments from our tenants of approximately million as the owner of the buildings  which include rental income and reimbursement of certain property costs such as common area maintenance  insurance  and property taxes  through the remainder of their respective lease terms 
the purchase of the buildings discharges our future lease obligations that were previously accounted for under our and restructuring plans 
as a result  in the first quarter of we expect to reverse our accrued facilities restructuring liability of million  which will result in a corresponding facilities restructuring benefit on the consolidated statement of income 
during the first quarter of  we also expect to record a charge of approximately million representing the cost to terminate the operating lease in the consolidated statements of income 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners in north america  europe and middle east  asia pacific  latin america  and russia 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currencies  except for informatica cayman ltd  which uses euros as its functional currency 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in foreign currencies  in particular the euro and british pound sterling  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries in their non functional currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our foreign operations  however  in most instances act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are generally denominated in their respective local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenses will be lower as well 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates which exist as part of ongoing business operations 
cash flow hedge activities we have attempted to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations through certain cash flow hedge programs
