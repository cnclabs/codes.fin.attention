additional information related to the concentration of revenue among our collaborators is reported in note segments  geographic information and significant collaborations to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
all of our collaboration agreements are denominated in us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies and estimates that we believe involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on four criteria  each of which must be met  in order to recognize revenue for the performance of services or the shipment of products 
revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or as services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectability is reasonably assured 
we follow asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements to determine the recognition of revenue under collaboration agreements that include multiple elements  including research and development services  achievement of development and commercialization milestones and drug product manufacturing 
this standard provides guidance on the accounting for arrangements involving the delivery of multiple elements when the delivery of separate units of accounting occurs in different reporting periods 
this standard addresses the determination of the units of accounting for multiple element arrangements and how the arrangement s consideration should be allocated to each unit of accounting 
we adopted this accounting standard on a prospective basis for all multiple element arrangements entered into on or after july  and for any multiple element arrangements that were entered into prior to july  but materially modified on or after july  the adoption of this standard may result in revenue recognition patterns for future agreements that are materially different from those recognized for our past collaboration arrangements 
for our multiple element transactions entered into on or after july   we evaluate the deliverables to determine if they meet the separation criteria under the standard and have stand alone value and we allocate revenue to the elements that meet the separation criteria based on their relative selling prices 

table of contents we treat deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria in this standard as a single unit of accounting  generally applying applicable revenue recognition guidance for the final deliverable to the combined unit of accounting 
since the adoption of this standard  we have entered into one agreement with multiple elements 
we have had no material modifications to arrangements that were entered into prior to july  we recognize revenue from non refundable up front payments and license fees on a straight line basis over the term of performance under the agreement 
when the performance period is not specifically identifiable from the agreement  we estimate the performance period based upon provisions contained within the agreement  such as the duration of the research or development term  the existence  or likelihood of achievement of development commitments and any other significant commitments 
for agreements entered into prior to july   the performance period is generally the estimated research or development term 
for agreements entered into after this date  the performance period for up front license fees may be shorter because the performance period  measured as the time between the execution date and the completion of the inseparable technology transfer  is typically a shorter period  generally up to six months 
we defer the up front payments and record them as deferred revenue upon receipt  pending recognition 
the deferred portions of payments are classified as a short term or long term liability in the accompanying condensed balance sheets  depending on the period over which revenue is expected to be recognized 
most of our agreements provide for milestone payments 
in certain cases  we recognize all or a portion of each milestone payment as revenue when the specific milestone is achieved based on the applicable percentage earned of the estimated research or development effort  or other performance obligation that has elapsed  to the total estimated research and or development effort 
in other cases  when the milestone payment is attributed to our future development obligations  we recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining development effort 
we periodically review the expected performance periods under each of our agreements that provide for non refundable up front payments and license fees and milestone payments 
we adjust the amortization periods when appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the duration of expected performance periods 
we could accelerate revenue recognition for non refundable license fees  up front payments and milestone payments in the event of early termination of programs 
alternatively  we could decelerate such revenue recognition if programs are extended 
while changes to such estimates have no impact on our reported cash flows  our reported revenue is significantly influenced by our estimates of the period over which our obligations are expected to be performed and  therefore  over which revenue is recognized 
cost of revenue and research and development expenses for proprietary programs we incur costs in connection with performing research and development activities which consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation  preclinical and clinical outsourcing costs and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation costs and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
we allocate these costs between cost of revenue and research and development expenses for proprietary programs based upon the respective time spent by our scientists on development conducted for our collaborators and for our internal proprietary programs 
cost of revenue represents the costs associated with research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  conducted by us for our collaborators 
research and development for proprietary programs consists of direct and indirect costs for our specific proprietary programs 
we do not bear any risk of 
table of contents failure for performing these activities and the payments are not contingent on the success or failure of the research program 
accordingly  we expense these costs when incurred 
where our collaboration agreements provide for us to conduct research and development on a number of programs and for which our partner has an option to obtain the right to conduct further development and to commercialize a portion of the programs subject to the agreement  we attribute a portion of its research and development costs to cost of revenue based on the percentage of total programs under the agreement that we conclude is likely to continue to be funded by the partner 
these costs may not be incurred equally across all programs 
in addition  we continually evaluate the progress of development activities under these agreements and if events or circumstances change in future periods that we reasonably believe would make it unlikely that a collaborator would continue to fund the same percentage of programs  we will adjust the allocation accordingly 
see note deferred revenue  for further information about our collaborations 
accrued outsourcing costs substantial portions of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are performed by third party laboratories  medical centers  contract research organizations and other vendors collectively cros 
these cros generally bill monthly or quarterly for services performed or bill based upon milestone achievement 
for preclinical studies  we accrue expenses based upon estimated percentage of work completed and the contract milestones remaining 
for clinical studies  expenses are accrued based upon the number of patients enrolled and the duration of the study 
we monitor patient enrollment  the progress of clinical studies and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews of data reported to us by the cros  correspondence with the cros and clinical site visits 
our estimates depend on the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by the cros regarding the status of each program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate our estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive 
fair value measurements our financial instruments are recognized and measured at fair value in our financial statements and primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments  trade receivables and payables  long term debt  embedded derivatives associated with the long term debt and warrants 
we measure the fair value of assets and liabilities based on a three level hierarchy that reflects market information available and the level of judgment involved in estimating fair values for various types of assets and liabilities 
the valuation techniques we use to measure fair value are discussed in more detail in note overview and basis of presentation to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market and other data to develop estimates of fair value for assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices in active markets  which include our ars  warrants issued by us in connection with our long term debt and the embedded derivatives associated with the long term debt 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on their estimated fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimates we disclose may not be indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange 
we periodically review the realizability of each investment when impairment indicators exist with respect to the investment 
if an other than temporary impairment of the value of an investment is deemed to exist  the cost basis of the investment is written down to its then estimated fair value 

table of contents long term debt and embedded derivatives the terms of our long term debt are discussed in detail in note long term debt to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the accounting for these arrangements is complex and is based upon significant estimates by management 
we review all debt agreements to determine the appropriate accounting treatment when the agreement is entered into and review all amendments to our debt agreements to determine if the changes require accounting for the amendment as a modification  or as an extinguishment and new debt 
we also review each long term debt arrangement to determine if any feature of the debt requires bifurcation and or separate valuation 
these may include hybrid instruments  which are comprised of at least two components a debt host instrument and one or more conversion features  warrants and other embedded derivatives  such as puts and other rights of the debt holder 
we currently have two embedded derivatives related to our long term debt with deerfield private design fund  lp and deerfield private design international fund  lp who we refer to collectively as deerfield 
one of the embedded derivatives is a variable interest rate structure that constitutes a liquidity linked variable spread feature 
the other is a significant transaction contingent put option relating to deerfield s ability to accelerate the repayment of the debt in the event of certain changes in control of our company 
such event would occur if the acquirer did not meet certain financial conditions  based on size and credit worthiness 
collectively  they are referred to as the embedded derivatives 
under the fair value hierarchy  we measure the fair value of the embedded derivatives using level iii  or unobservable inputs  as there is no active market for them  and calculate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and the black derman toy interest rate model 
the fair value of the variable interest rate structure is based on our estimate of the probable effective interest rate over the term of the deerfield credit facilities 
because the applicable interest rate is based on our cash position during the term of the loan  the determination of the probably effective interest rate requires us to estimate our cash flow forecasts  which include our expectations of future cash inflows from up front fees  milestone payments and issuances of equity 
the fair value of the put option is based on our estimate of the probability that a change in control that triggers deerfield s right to accelerate the debt will occur 
with those inputs  the fair value of each embedded derivative is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the deerfield credit facilities if the embedded derivatives are included and the fair value of the deerfield credit facilities if the embedded derivatives are excluded 
due to the inherent complexity in valuing the deerfield credit facilities and the embedded derivatives  we engaged a third party valuation firm to perform the valuation as part of our overall fair value analysis 
the assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives were based on management s judgment and the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different estimated fair values 
the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded as derivative liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
we recorded fair values for the embedded derivatives of thousand and thousand at june  and  respectively 
the initial fair value of the embedded derivatives was recorded as derivative liabilities and as debt discount in our balance sheets 
each quarter  we determine whether any adjustments to the fair value of the embedded derivatives based on management s then current assumptions are necessary and record any changes in value to derivative liabilities in the balance sheets and interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
warrants that we have issued in connection with our long term debt arrangements have been classified as equity 
we valued the warrants at issuance based on a black scholes option pricing model and then 
table of contents allocated a portion of the proceeds under the debt to the warrants based upon their relative fair values 
the warrants are recorded in stockholders deficit with the offset to debt discount 
the debt discount is being amortized from the respective draw dates to the end of the term of the deerfield credit facilities using the effective interest method and recorded as interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
transaction fees paid in connection with our long term debt arrangements that qualify for capitalization are recorded as other long term assets in the balance sheets and amortized to interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss using the effective interest method over the term of the underlying debt agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
this asu provides a consistent definition of fair value between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
additionally  the asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is to be applied prospectively 
we adopted this disclosure standard in the third quarter of fiscal and adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income in us gaap and ifrs 
this asu provides companies the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the provisions of this new guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this new guidance will not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force and the securities exchange commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on our present or future financial statements

change vs 
license revenue milestone revenue total license and milestone revenue 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal license revenue increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
we recognized increased license revenue of million during the current fiscal year due to our new licensing agreement with genentech for our chk program  arry there was no corresponding revenue for the chk program in fiscal partially offsetting this increase was reduced revenue from the suspended amortization of the up front license fees previously received from celgene following temporary suspension of the associated research activities see note deferred revenue celgene corporation to the accompanying financial statements 
milestone revenue increased million  or  over the prior year primarily due to the recognition of million of the million milestone payment we received from amgen during the fourth quarter of fiscal for enrollment of patients in a phase study of amg arry during fiscal  we also recognized million additional revenue related to a full year of amortization for the million celgene milestone payment received in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  license revenue increase by approximately million  or 
we recognized million and million during the current fiscal year in additional license revenue under our collaborations with amgen and novartis  respectively 
the fiscal amounts represented a full year of revenue compared to only six and three months of revenue  respectively  recognized under the these collaborations during fiscal as the collaborations were not in place for the full year 
this increased revenue was partially offset by decreased revenue of million recognized under our collaboration with celgene due to the longer period over which revenue is recognized following our conclusion that the remaining estimated performance period under the collaboration with celgene extended from september to march effective october  see note deferred revenue celgene corporation to the accompanying financial statements 
milestone revenue increased in fiscal by million  or  over the prior year 
this increase consisted of million in additional revenue from our collaboration with novartis resulting from the million milestone payment received in the fourth quarter of fiscal and from additional milestone revenue recognized under the full year of the agreement in fiscal we also recognized an additional million in revenue under our collaboration with celgene from the million milestone payment received in the second quarter of fiscal collaboration revenue collaboration revenue consists of revenue for our performance of drug discovery and development activities in collaboration with partners  which include co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license as well as screening  lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research and to a small degree the development and sale of chemical compounds 
below is a summary of our collaboration revenue dollars in thousands years ended june  change vs 
change vs 
collaboration revenue fiscal compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased by million  or  due to fewer scientists engaged on our collaborations with genentech and amgen during the second half of fiscal compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease was partially offset by revenue for ftes working on our collaborations with celgene and dna biopharma for which there was no corresponding revenue in fiscal 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased by million  or  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to fewer scientists engaged on our collaboration with genentech during the second half of fiscal  which resulted in million less revenue compared to fiscal this decrease was partially offset by increased revenue of million and thousand from funded research under our collaborations with amgen and novartis  respectively 
cost of revenue cost of revenue represents costs attributable to discovery and development including preclinical and clinical trials we may conduct for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold from our inventory 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation  preclinical and clinical outsourcing costs and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  travel and meals  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation costs and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
below is a summary of our cost of revenue dollars in thousands years ended june  change vs

cost of revenue cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal cost of revenue decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of fewer scientists engaged on our collaborations with genentech and amgen during the second half of fiscal cost of revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue due to the increased license and milestone revenue recognized in fiscal as discussed above 
fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  cost of revenue increased thousand  or  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars was related to the restructuring charges incurred during the fourth quarter as discussed under note restructuring charges fiscal restructuring to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we recorded million to cost of revenue from the reduction in force 
in addition  related to the restructuring  we vacated a portion of one of our significant laboratory facilities at our longmont facility and recorded thousand to cost of revenue in accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements 
this increase was partially offset by reduced outsourcing costs to advance our partnered programs with amgen and novartis through clinical trials  as our partners now bear all or an increased share of the development costs compared to the prior year 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue is the result of increased license and milestone revenue recognized during the year which did not have a direct impact on our expenses 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery our research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery include costs associated with our proprietary drug programs for scientific and clinical personnel  supplies  inventory  equipment  small tools  travel and meals  depreciation  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials and share based compensation 
we manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals 
our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible  however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and 
table of contents costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project 
as a result  we do not report costs on a program basis

change vs 
salaries  benefits and share based compensation outsourced services and consulting laboratory supplies facilities and depreciation other total research and development for proprietary drug discovery fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease was the result of our new license agreement with genentech and our new collaboration and license agreement with aslan pharmaceuticals which resulted in the corresponding program costs shifting to the collaboration partner 
fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery for fiscal decreased by million because our development costs for amg and mek both shifted out of research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery to cost of revenue as a result of partnering those programs with amgen and novartis during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
those decreases were partially offset by the increased development costs from continuing to progress our most advanced wholly owned drug programs through the clinic 
also included in fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery were restructuring charges incurred during the fourth quarter as discussed in note restructuring charges fiscal restructuring within the notes to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we recorded million and million to research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery from the reduction in force and accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements  respectively 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits not included in cost of revenue or research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery and include other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including patent filing and prosecution  recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses

general and administrative 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily for lower compensation related costs following the reduction in force during june as well as a reduction in stock compensation expense related to the termination of our former ceo 
partially offsetting these decreases were additional costs incurred to hire our new ceo and search fees for our new board member 
additionally  we spent approximately thousand less on business related tax expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased thousand  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a thousand decrease in stock compensation expense from fully vested options as well as a thousand decrease in the estimated liability for our fiscal performance bonus compared to the prior year

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses and an accumulated deficit as a result of ongoing research and development spending since inception 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we had net losses of million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
we have historically funded our operations from up front fees and license and milestone payments received under our collaboration and out licensing transactions  from the issuance and sale of equity securities and through debt provided by our credit facilities 
for example  we received net proceeds of approximately million in february from an underwritten public offering of our common stock 
table of contents and have received million in the last months through the date of filing this annual report  including the following payments under our collaborations in december  we received a million up front payment from amgen inc under a collaboration and license agreement 
in april  we received million in up front and milestone payments under a license agreement with novartis pharmaceutical international ltd 
in december  we received a million milestone payment under a license agreement with celgene corporation 
in may  we received a million milestone payment under a license agreement with novartis pharmaceutical international ltd 
in september  we received a million milestone payment under a license agreement with genentech  inc in june  we received an million milestone payment from amgen following achievement of a pre defined patient enrollment milestone in a phase trial 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we will continue to utilize existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and will continue to depend on funds provided from the sources mentioned above  which may not be available or forthcoming 
during fiscal  we expect to begin paying our share of the combined development costs since inception of the mek program  as discussed in note deferred revenue novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
as of june   we have reported a million payable in the accompanying balance sheet as co development liability for this obligation 
management believes that the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of june  will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the next months 
because sufficient funds may not be available to us when needed from existing collaborations  we expect that we will be required to continue to fund our operations in part through the sale of debt or equity securities and through licensing select programs that include up front and or milestone payments 
our ability to successfully raise sufficient funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when needed is subject to many risks and uncertainties and  even if we are successful  future equity issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
we also may not successfully consummate new collaborations that provide for additional up front fees or milestone payments or we may not earn milestone payments under such collaborations when anticipated or at all 
our ability to realize milestone or royalty payments under existing collaboration agreements and to enter into new partnering arrangements that generate additional revenue through up front fees and milestone or royalty payments is subject to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control and include the following the drug development process is risky and highly uncertain and we may not be successful in generating proof of concept data to create partnering opportunities and  even if we are  we or our collaborators may not be successful in commercializing drug candidates we create  we may fail to select the best drug from our wholly owned pipeline to advance and invest in registration  or phase studies  our collaborators have substantial control and discretion over the timing and continued development and marketing of drug candidates we create and  therefore  we may not receive milestone  royalty or other payments when anticipated or at all  the drug candidates we develop may not obtain regulatory approval  
table of contents if regulatory approval is received  drugs we develop will remain subject to regulation or may not gain market acceptance  which could delay or prevent us from generating milestone  royalty revenue or product revenue from the commercialization of these drugs  and we cannot control or predict the spending priorities and willingness of pharmaceutical companies to in license drugs for further development and commercialization 
our assessment of our future need for funding and our ability to continue to fund our operations for the next months is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including our ability to enter into agreements to out license  co develop our proprietary drug candidates and the timing of payments under those agreements throughout each candidate s development stage  the number and scope of our research and development programs  the progress and success of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the progress and success of the development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to maintain current collaboration agreements  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and or the expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition and technological developments  general economic and market conditions and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding from these or other sources when needed  or to the extent needed  it may be necessary to significantly reduce the current rate of spending through further reductions in staff and delaying  scaling back  or stopping certain research and development programs  including more costly phase and phase clinical trials on our wholly owned programs as these programs progress into later stage development 
insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish greater rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms to us and our stockholders than we would otherwise choose in order to obtain up front license fees needed to fund operations 
these events could prevent us from successfully executing our operating plan and in the future could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
further  as discussed in note long term debt  the entire debt balance of million outstanding with deerfield private design fund  lp and certain of its affiliates collectively referred to as deerfield becomes due and payable if our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities falls below million at the end of a fiscal quarter 
based on our current forecasts and expectations  which are subject to many factors outside of our control  we do not anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will fall below this level prior to maturity of such debt
