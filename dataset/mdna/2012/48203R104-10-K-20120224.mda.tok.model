the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
in the course of operating our business  we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices  the collection of receivables  the manufacturing and shipment of products  the fulfillment of orders  the purchase of supplies  and the building of inventory and spare parts  among other matters 
each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period 
in making these decisions  we consider various factors including contractual obligations  customer satisfaction  competition  internal and external financial targets and expectations  and financial planning objectives

table of contents business and market environment at juniper networks  we focus on architecting the new network 
we design  develop  and sell products and services that together provide our customers with a high performance network infrastructure built on simplicity  security  openness  and scale 
we serve the high performance networking requirements of global service providers  enterprises  governments  and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success 
our broad product portfolio spans routing  switching  security  application acceleration  identity policy and control  and network management to provide customers high performance  greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership 
we do business in three geographic regions americas  europe  middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific apac  and our operations are organized into two reportable segments infrastructure and service layer technologies slt 
our infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used to control and direct network traffic from the core  through the edge  aggregation  and the customer premise equipment level  as well as a complete wireless local area network wlan solution that provides high reliability  performance  security  and management for mobile applications 
our slt segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customers priorities  from protecting the network itself and data on the network  to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed network 
both segments offer worldwide services  including technical support under maintenance contracts and professional services  as well as educational and training programs to our customers 
over the past two years we have aligned our organization around a common vision for the new network 
together  our high performance product and service offerings help our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation  value  and increased performance  reliability  and security to end users 
we remain dedicated to uncovering new ideas and innovations that will serve the exponential demands of the networked world and we will continue to build solutions that center on simplification  automation  and open innovation 
during  we continued to experience a challenging macroeconomic environment 
the effect of the increased macro volatility escalated especially over the second half of the year due to sovereign debt concerns in europe as well as slow down of the economies in apac and in the americas 
a number of our largest us customers  including tier service providers and financial service firms  reduced their spend toward the end of the year 
additionally  our customers held off their core routing purchases in anticipation of the t series launch as we entered into a new product cycle 
despite the impact from the near term challenges  our revenue grew in the investments we have made in r d are delivering on a wave of new products  from our new offerings in the data center  qfabric  to enterprise mobility and to our converged supercore routing technology 
the three core components of qfabric the node  interconnect and director were released  the next wave of mobilenext features including the s gateway for mobile operators were announced during the year  our converged supercore solution  ptx series switches  are expected to begin shipment in the first quarter of  and the t core router commenced shipment in the fourth quarter of in addition  we have put the right organization structure in place to effectively drive our innovative portfolio and support our customers next generation network requirements 
in the coming year  we will remain focused on balancing the longer term needs of the business while remaining agile and prudent with our spending in the short term 
we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remain healthy and we are focused on executing our strategy to address the market trends of mobile internet and cloud computing 
we believe our strategy aligns well with the driving forces of the network 
we believe innovation will drive long term value creation in the networking industry  as customers forgo the complexity and unnecessary costs of old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across the multiple dimensions of network growth 
with our strategy  our innovation pipeline  and the deeper penetration in both service provider and enterprise markets  we plan to navigate the challenging near term environment in based on the following five operating principles assume continued uncertainty in the near term macro environment  grow faster than the markets we serve by focusing on new product introductions to accelerate growth as we exit  maintain investments that deliver innovation and our product roadmap  focus on prudent cost management  and generate good cash flows to support our strategic needs and maintain a strong balance sheet 

table of contents financial results and key performance metrics overview the following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended december   and in millions  except per share amounts and percentages 
table of contents years ended december  years ended december  change change change change net revenues gross margin percentage of net revenues operating income percentage of net revenues net income attributable to juniper networks percentage of net revenues net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stockholders basic diluted operating cash flows deferred revenue days sales outstanding dso book to bill net revenues our net revenue increased across all three geographic regions and in both service provider and enterprise markets for year ended december   compared to the prior year 
these increases were primarily driven by increases in revenue from routing and switching products as well as higher service revenue across both the infrastructure and slt segments  partially offset by a slight decrease in our slt product revenue 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased for year ended december   compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower product and service gross margin percentages and a higher proportion of service revenue for which gross margin is generally lower than product margin 
product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue declined due to a shift in geographic mix  increased overhead and increased inventory related costs 
service gross margin as a percentage of service revenue declined mainly due to the investment in resources to support our expanded product portfolio 
operating income our operating income decreased as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december   compared to  primarily due to slower revenue growth relative to the increase of investments in sales and marketing and research and development r d expenses as we continue to invest in our innovative portfolio and increase sales coverage for our new products 
in addition  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million in the year ended december   primarily related to workforce reduction activities and asset impairments 
net income attributable to juniper networks and net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stockholders the decrease in net income attributable to juniper networks in the year ended december   compared to  reflects the lower operating income discussed above as well as higher interest expense of million primarily attributable to interest on our long term debt issued in march operating cash flows operating cash flows in december  increased compared to operating cash flows in the prior year included a million litigation settlement payment 
deferred revenue total deferred revenue increased million to million as of december   compared to million as of december   due to an increase in deferred service revenue driven by product sales and renewals  slightly offset by a small decrease in deferred product revenue 
total deferred service revenue increased million compared to december   primarily due to an increase in new service contracts and renewal of existing contracts 
deferred gross product revenue as of december   decreased million compared to december   primarily due to the release of approximately million from various product commitments made as of december  and delivered during  partially offset by new product commitments and other deferrals 

table of contents dso dso as of december  was relatively flat compared to the prior year 
dso is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable  net of allowances  divided by average daily net sales for the preceding days 
book to bill book to bill was one for the quarter ended december   and greater than one for the quarter ended december  book to bill represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period 
product orders exclude certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals  sales return reserves  and service revenue allocations  and early payment discounts 
stock repurchase plan activity under our stock repurchase program  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million during the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience  and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
under our revenue recognition policies  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor third party evidence tpe is available 
we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately 
esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives  pricing practices and controls  customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles 
when determining esp  we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles 
we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one to three years 
we apply esp to the majority of our product revenue and vsoe to our service revenue in and contract manufacturer liabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair  and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers  and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs  and standards that we establish  and they procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts 
these forecasts are our estimates of future demand for our products  based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
we establish a provision for inventory  carrying costs  and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends 
significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand  inventory carrying costs  and obsolete material exposures 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  we may incur charges for excess 
table of contents components  which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 
as of december  and  our contract manufacturer liabilities were million and million  respectively 
warranty reserves 
we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
we use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  labor costs for trouble shooting and repair  and overhead at the time revenue is recognized 
material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period 
technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  if actual product failure rates  use of materials  or service delivery costs differ from estimates  additional warranty costs may be incurred  which could reduce gross margin 
as of december  and  our warranty reserves were million and million  respectively 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
we make significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions  and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base  and the expected use of the acquired assets 
these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 
the value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as  but not limited to a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  b a substantial decline in our market capitalization  c an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  d unanticipated competition  e loss of key personnel  f a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  g a realignment of our resources or restructuring of our existing businesses in response to changes to industry and market conditions  h testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or i higher discount rate used in the impairment analysis as impacted by an increase in interest rates 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of november st or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segment level  by comparing the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches 
under the income approach  we estimate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of forecasted future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
under the market approach  we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting units to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
when the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or a indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  operating trends  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocated shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
as of december   goodwill recorded for our slt segment and infrastructure segment was  million and  million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease of in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would result in excess fair value over carrying value of approximately nil for our slt segment to billion for our infrastructure segment 
we evaluate long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the 
table of contents underlying asset or asset group  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if a long lived asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
share based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards including employee stock options  restricted stock units rsus  performance share awards psas  and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp based on each award s fair value on the grant date 
we utilize the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options and espp 
the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected award life  and risk free interest rate 
the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock  adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
the expected life of an award is based on historical experience  the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees  and the potential effect from options that have not been exercised 
we determine the fair value of rsus and psas based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
in addition  we use significant judgment in estimating share based compensation expense for our psas based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
if factors change and different assumptions are used  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
additionally  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as judgment and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our recorded share based compensation expense could be different 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates may differ from the statutory rate due to factors such as  but not limited to  foreign operations  r d tax credits  tax audit settlements  changes in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets  non deductible compensation  and transfer pricing adjustments 
our effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties  if applicable 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized through the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and future income  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
in the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance is reversed  resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with 
table of contents a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
loss contingencies 
we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation  and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses

our switching products  including ex series  qfabric and wlan products  increased due to strength in our ex series products  both in data center and campus deployments 
we also recorded initial revenues from the first deployment of our qfabric solution 
the increase in infrastructure revenue was partially offset by the decline in revenue from the m and t series routers primarily attributable to weaker overall demand from service providers driven by uncertain macroeconomic environment as well as an expected pause as we introduce the t router 
slt product revenue also had a slight decrease in  compared to  primarily attributed to the decline in our high end product lines influenced by the timing of our high end srx service provider deployments and the transition from older enterprise security products to our new security product portfolio

these increases were primarily from sales of our routing and switching products such as mx series routers  ex series switches and wlan 
the increase in infrastructure service revenue in  was primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services and increased installed base from our infrastructure product sales 
infrastructure operating income decreased as a percent of infrastructure revenue in  compared to  was largely due to the decline in product margins and higher operating expenses  partially offset by lower variable compensation in we track infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth 
most of our infrastructure product platforms are modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media

the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 
chassis revenue units 
table of contents represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period 
infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in  compared to  primarily due to the increase in shipments of our mx series routers  particularly the mid range mx product lines 
the increase in shipments of the mid range mx product lines  which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis  drove the higher number of ports shipped in  compare to in  infrastructure products revenue experienced growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions compared to this increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our mx series routers and ex series switches

generally  we do not own the components and title to the product transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location 
if the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time  we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 
as of december   we had accrued million based on our estimate of such charges 
total purchase commitments as of december   consisted of million of ncnr orders 
tax liabilities include million of long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes

in march  we issued notes in the amount of billion under the shelf registration statement 
therefore  while we have no current plans to do so  we may issue up to million in additional securities under the shelf registration statement

any additional offerings of securities under the shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus 
we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant 
our intention for fiscal year was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at less than three percent of our common stock outstanding 
based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options  rsus  and psas counting only the on target measure of such psas  we achieved the goal for we have also managed our equity compensation programs to reduce the overall number of shares subject to outstanding awards over the past two years 
the total number of common shares subject to our outstanding option  rsu  and psa awards was million  million  and million shares as of december    and  respectively  reflecting a consecutive decline for the three years ended december  based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term  and long term investments which includes the proceeds of the issuance of the notes  together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next months 
we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period 
however  our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors  including level and mix of our product  sales  and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditures and r d plans  repurchases of our common stock  incurrence and repayment of debt and related interest obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility 
in addition  as of december   of our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities are held in non us domiciled countries 
our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december    and  related to the sales of our investments 
the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december   and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions

the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts periodically  we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less 
our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars 
our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
approximately of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by non us dollar denominated operating expense and costs 
in designing a specific hedging approach  we consider several factors  including offsetting exposures  significance of exposures  costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument  and potential effectiveness of the hedge 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates 
we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial during the years ended december    and  respectively  in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue  r d  sales and marketing  and g a expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately   and in   and  respectively 
if overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the us dollar uniformly changes by  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in us dollars would change by less than  assuming constant foreign currency cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances 
equity price risk our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities and our non qualified deferred compensation nqdc plan  which may 
table of contents also hold publicly traded equity securities  are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 
our publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not purchase our publicly traded equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes 
as of december   and  the total investments under the nqdc plan were million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change on the total investments under the nqdc plan as of december   and would result in an immaterial loss 
we have also invested in privately held companies 
these investments are carried at cost
