overview we are a leading provider of global print management and promotional solutions to corporate clients across a wide range of industries 
with proprietary technology  an extensive supplier network and deep domain expertise  the company procures  manages and delivers printed materials and promotional products as part of a comprehensive outsourced enterprise solution 
our technology is designed to capitalize on excess manufacturing capacity and other inefficiencies in the traditional print supply chain to obtain favorable pricing and to deliver high quality products and services for our clients 
our proprietary software applications and database  ppm  create a fully integrated solution that stores  analyzes and tracks the production capabilities of our supplier network  as well as quote and price data for each bid we receive and print job we execute 
as a result  we believe ppm contains one of the largest independent repositories of equipment profiles and price data for print suppliers in the united states 
we leverage our technology to match each print job with the supplier that is optimally suited to meet the client s needs at a highly competitive price 
our procurement managers use ppm to manage the print procurement process from end to end 
through our supplier network of approximately  suppliers  we offer a full range of print  fulfillment and logistics services that allows us to procure printed products on virtually any substrate 
the breadth of our product offerings and services and the depth of our supplier network enable us to fulfill all of the print procurement needs of our clients 
by leveraging our technology platform  our clients are able to reduce overhead costs  redeploy internal resources and obtain favorable pricing and service terms 
in addition  our ability to track individual transactions and provide customized reports detailing print procurement activity on an enterprise wide basis provides our clients with greater visibility and control of their print expenditures 
since  we have expanded from a regional focus to a national and then international focus with the acquisitions of cpro  a leading provider of print solutions in latin america  and productions graphics  a leading print management firm with a particular strength in continental europe  in we operate in different countries 
in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our operations into two segments based on geographic regions united states and international 
the united states segment includes operations in the united states  and the international segment includes operations in the united kingdom  continental europe and latin america 
in  we generated revenues of million in the united states segment and million in the international segment 
we believe the opportunity exists to expand our business into new geographic markets 
our objective is to continue to increase our sales in the major print markets in the united states and internationally 
we intend to hire or acquire more account executives within close proximity to these large markets 
revenue we generate revenue through the sale of printed products to our clients 
our revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  reflecting growth rates of and in and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
our revenue is generated from two different types of clients enterprise and transactional 
enterprise jobs usually involve higher dollar amounts and volume than our transactional jobs 
we categorize a client as an enterprise client if we have a contract with the client for the provision of printing services on a recurring basis  if the client has signed an open ended purchase order  or a series of related purchase orders  or if the client has enrolled in our e stores program  which enables the client to make online purchases of printing services on a recurring basis 
we categorize all other clients as transactional 
we enter into contracts with our enterprise clients to provide some or a specific portion of their printed products on a recurring basis 
our contracts with enterprise clients are generally three to five years subject to termination by either party upon prior notice ranging from days to twelve months 
several of our enterprise clients have outsourced substantially all of their recurring print needs to us 
we provide printed products to our transactional clients on an order by order basis 
for the years ended december   and  enterprise clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively  while transactional clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
our revenue consists of the prices paid by our clients for printed products 
these prices  in turn  reflect the amounts charged to us by our suppliers plus our gross profit 
our gross profit margin  in the case of some of our enterprise clients  is fixed by contract or  in the case of transactional clients  is negotiated on a job by job basis 
once either type of client accepts our pricing terms  the selling price is established and we procure the product for our own account in order to re sell it to the client 
we take full title and risk of loss for the product upon shipment 
the finished product is typically shipped directly from our supplier to a destination specified by our client 
upon shipment  our supplier invoices us for its production costs and we invoice our client 
our revenue from enterprise clients tends to generate lower gross profit margins than our revenue from transactional clients because the gross profit margins established in our contracts with large enterprise clients are generally lower than the gross profit margins we typically realize in our transactional business 
although our enterprise revenue generates lower gross profit margins  our enterprise business tends to be as profitable as our transactional business on an operating profit basis because the commission expense associated with enterprise jobs is generally lower 
cost of goods sold and gross profit our cost of goods sold consists primarily of the price at which we purchase products from our suppliers 
our selling price  including our gross profit  in the case of some of our enterprise jobs  is based on a fixed gross margin established by contract or  in the case of transactional jobs  is determined at the discretion of the account executive or procurement manager within predetermined parameters 
our gross margins on our enterprise jobs are typically lower than our gross margins on our transactional jobs 
as a result  our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for our enterprise jobs is typically higher than those for our transactional jobs 
our gross profit for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
operating expenses and income from operations our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of commissions paid to our account executives  compensation costs for our management team and procurement managers as well as compensation costs for our finance and support employees  public company expenses  and corporate systems  legal and accounting  facilities and travel and entertainment expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
we accrue for commissions when we recognize the related revenue 
some of our account executives receive a monthly draw to provide them with a more consistent income stream 
the cash paid to our account executives in advance of commissions earned is reflected as a prepaid expense on our balance sheet 
as our account executives earn commissions  a portion of their commission payment is withheld and offset against their prepaid commission balance  if any 
our prepaid commission balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we agree to provide our clients with printed products that conform to the industry standard of a commercially reasonable quality  and our suppliers in turn agree to provide us with products of the same quality 
in addition  the quotes we execute with our clients include customary industry terms and conditions that limit the amount of our liability for product defects 
product defects have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are required to make payment to our suppliers for completed print jobs regardless of whether our clients make payment to us 
our bad debt expense was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our income from operations for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title transfers  which occurs when the product is shipped either from a third party to the customer or shipped directly from our warehouse to the customer 
unbilled revenue relates to shipments that have been made to customers for which the related account receivable has not yet been billed 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  principal agent considerations and other presentation matters  we recognize revenue on a gross basis  as opposed to a net basis similar to a commission arrangement  because it bears the risks and benefits associated with revenue generated activities by acting as a principal in the transaction  establishing prices  being responsible for fulfillment of the order  taking the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and marketing the products  among other things 
accounts receivable the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects management s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
management individually reviews all accounts receivable balances and  based on an assessment of current creditworthiness  estimates the portion  if any  of the balance that will not be collected 
fully reserved receivables are reviewed on a monthly basis and uncollectible accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted 
at december   the gross accounts receivable balance includes approximately of customer balances that are in excess of one year 
management believes any uncollectible amounts are adequately reserved for at december  goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identified assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually  or if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
we evaluate recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
for goodwill impairment test purposes  we have two reporting units  united states and international 
in the first step  the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed  which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting unit and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting unit 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
as a result of the analysis performed  no impairment charges were required 
as of december   our consolidated goodwill balance was million 
asc also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators exist 
our intangible assets consist of customer lists  trade names  noncompete agreements and patents 
our customer lists are being amortized using the economic useful life method over their estimated weighted average useful lives of approximately fourteen years 
our noncompete agreements  trade names and patents are being amortized on the straight line basis over their estimated weighted average useful lives 
as of december   the net balance of our intangible assets was million 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation awards in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
compensation expense is measured by determining the fair value using the black scholes option valuation model and is then recognized over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period  on a straight line basis for the entire award 
this valuation model requires assumptions  which impact the assumed fair value  including the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate  expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
stock based compensation cost recognized during the period is based on the portion of the share based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost recognized has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company recorded million  million and million in compensation expense related to stock based compensation  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in connection with the purchase of corevision  inc in september  we acquired  in net operating loss carryforwards that will expire in at december    of losses remain outstanding for future use 
in connection with the purchasing of marketing out of the box in july  we acquired  in net operating loss carryforwards that will expire in at december    of losses remain outstanding for future use 
no valuation allowance on our net operating loss carryforwards is considered necessary as the amounts are more likely than not to be realized

we do not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds  however  should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations locally or through debt or equity issuances  we could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions 
if foreign earnings were to be remitted to the us  foreign tax credits would be available to reduce any us tax due upon repatriation

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of this new guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
in september  the fasb amended its standards related to goodwill impairment testing with the objective being to simplify the annual goodwill impairment process by allowing entities to use qualitative factors first before performing the traditional two step goodwill impairment test 
the two step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
adoption of the new standard was permitted for the company s fourth quarter impairment test  but we elected to perform the traditional two step test until a further assessment could be made 
we have not yet determined if this standard will be adopted in because the measurement of a potential impairment has not changed  the standard will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are dependent upon the availability of paper  and paper prices represent a substantial portion of the cost of our products 
the supply and price of paper depend on a variety of factors over which we have no control  including environmental and conservation regulations  natural disasters and weather 
we believe a increase in the price of paper would not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated statements of income or cash flows  as these costs are generally passed through to our clients 
interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
interest is payable at the adjusted libor rate or the alternate base 
assuming our million revolving credit facility was fully drawn  a increase in the interest rate would increase our annual interest expense by million 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  in particular because all of our investments are in cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the average duration of all of our investments as of december  was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure
