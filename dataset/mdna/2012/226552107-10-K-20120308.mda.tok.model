restructuring and other charges in july  we initiated plans to restructure and improve efficiencies in our operations as a result of the continued lack of profitability and other challenges in our seminar sales channel for our storesonline division 
restructurings began in the third quarter of in an effort to better position our company for long term growth  profitability  greater competitiveness and improved efficiency across our business 
actions taken in connection with our restructuring plan include the suspension of our direct mail marketing campaigns and sales of our products and services through our storesonline seminar channel  refinement of our product portfolio focused towards recurring subscription based products and services  and redeployment of our sales and marketing resources in an effort to increase our direct sales  inside sales  and online sales channels 
through these initiatives we incurred aggregate pre tax restructuring charges and pre tax transition expenses of approximately  during the twelve months ending december  of this   was recorded for inventory write downs  unused direct response advertising  and intangible asset impairment charges for the twelve months ended december  the remaining amount relates to the cancellation of a lease agreement 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue from sales of a variety of services to entrepreneurs  small and medium sized businesses  including website builder software subscriptions  web design  seo  paid search management  hosting  link building  hosted telecom subscriptions  and commissions from third parties 
leads are generated primarily through direct mail marketing campaigns  online advertising campaigns  and strategic partnerships 
license revenue we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from cash collected on the sale of our content management and web building software licenses at workshop events held throughout the year  as well as principal collected on the sale of software licenses sold through extended payment term arrangements eptas 
as a result of the restructuring plan we initiated in july  we will no longer generate revenue from cash collected on the sale of our content management and web building software licenses at workshop events 
we believe we will  however  continue to generate revenue from principal collected on our epta contracts for the next two to three years at a decreasing rate over that time period 
professional services revenue we generate professional services revenue primarily from website design and development  search engine optimization services  link building  paid search management services  conversion rate optimization services  and telecom installation services 
these services are typically billed on a fixed price basis or on a monthly recurring basis with an initial term of six to twelve months 
subscription and hosting revenue we generate revenue from monthly saas subscription fees on our website builder platform as well as monthly subscription fees on our hosted telecom offering 
we also derive revenue from monthly web hosting fees from our software license customers who utilize our hosting services 
revenue is recognized ratably on a daily basis over the life of the contract for all subscription and hosting services 
the typical contract is a recurring monthly contract  although terms range up to months 
product revenue we generate product revenue from the sale of telephone equipment  as well as dvd training courses covering a host of online marketing topics  including affiliate marketing  amazon and ebay training  comparison shopping engines  competitive reconnaissance  conversion rate optimization  keyword research  link building  localization and regionalization  paid search campaigns  permission marketing  search engine optimization  social media marketing  and google analytics 
these products are typically billed on a fixed price basis 
these dvd training courses  which have historically been sold through our direct mail seminar channel  are now available for sale through our inside sales channel 
commission revenue we generate commissions from contracted third party companies who telemarket complementary products and services to our customer base 
this commission is typically paid as a percentage of revenue generated by these third party companies on products and services sold to our customer base 
as the lead source for the commission revenue has been our direct mail seminar events  which we discontinued in july  we do not anticipate we will generate significant commission revenue in the future 
economic factors the tight credit markets in place over the past several years have adversely affected our storesonline business as consumers and businesses continued to be limited in their ability to obtain alternate sources of financing 
the tight credit markets contributed to our decision to suspend the sale of our products and services through the seminar sales channel 
the high unemployment rate has had a negative impact on our storesonline customer base and has continued to result in high default rates on our accounts receivable 
while we have seen our collection rates stabilize and improve slightly over the past several quarters  our default rate remains high 
as we recognize revenue when the cash is collected on our accounts receivable portfolio  an improvement in our collection rates will result in additional future revenue  while deterioration in our collection rate will decrease future revenue 
opportunities technological and product innovation is the foundation of our long term growth strategy  and we intend to increase our commitment to invest in product development  engineering excellence  and delivering high quality products and services to customers 
we have organized crexendo web services and crexendo network services around our primary business objectives which are to help entrepreneurs and small and medium businesses increase the effectiveness and visibility of their online presence  as well as decreasing their infrastructure and communications costs 
crexendo web services offers a wide range of services  including content management  saas  seo services  search engine management services  website and logo design services and conversion rate optimization services 
crexendo network services offers a suite of high quality voice and messaging services over broadband networks 
we believe our long term focus on investing in products and developing new and alternative sales channels is enabling us to build a foundation for growth by delivering innovative products  creating opportunities for potential channel partners  and improving customer satisfaction 
our focus continues to be to execute in key areas through ongoing innovation on our integrated content management software solution  responding effectively to customer and partner needs  and focusing internally on product excellence  business efficacy  and accountability across our company 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and form the basis for the following discussion and analysis on critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our board of directors and its audit committee 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the critical accounting policies and estimates described below reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact and any associated risks on our business that are related to these policies are also discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product or service has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and the collection of our fees is probable 
specifics to revenue category are as follows cash sales of software licenses  telecom equipment  and dvd training courses  are recognized as revenue when the cash is received  net of expected customer refunds  upon expiration of the customers rescission period  which typically occurs three days after the licenses are delivered or when the internet training workshop takes place  whichever occurs later 
software licenses and dvd training courses sold under eptas are recognized as revenue upon receipt of cash from customers and not at the time of sale 
although we believe we are able to reasonably estimate the collectability of our receivables based upon our history of offering eptas  accounting standards require revenue to be deferred until customer payments are received if collection of the original principal balance is not probable 
additionally  if we subsequently sell the receivables on a non recourse basis  accounting standards require that the related revenue be deferred until the customer makes cash payments to the third party purchaser of the receivables 
there are no receivable balances outstanding that are subject to recourse by our company 
we enter into agreements where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products and or services 
for these arrangements  we determine whether the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and in the event the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  whether the delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are met  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative selling price 
if these criteria are not met  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized ratably over the contract term or deferred until the earlier of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is delivered 
the amount of product and services revenue recognized for arrangements with multiple deliverables is impacted by the allocation of arrangement consideration to the deliverables in the arrangement based on the relative selling prices 
in determining our selling prices  we apply the selling price hierarchy using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe when available  third party evidence of selling price tpe if vsoe does not exist  and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for a deliverable when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rate 
in addition  we consider major service groups  geographies  customer classifications  and other variables in determining vsoe 
we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality is difficult to obtain 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost of products  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact the timing of revenue recognized but does not change the total revenue recognized on any agreement 
professional services revenue fees collected for professional services  including website design and development  search engine optimization services  link building  paid search management services  and telecom installation services are recognized as revenue  net of expected customer refunds  over the period during which the services are expected to be performed  based upon the fair value for such services 
fees related to epta contracts are deferred and recognized as revenue during the service period or when cash is collected  whichever occurs later 
subscription and hosting revenue fees collected for subscription and hosting revenue are recognized ratably as services are provided 
customers are billed for these services on a monthly or annual basis at the customer s option 
for all of our customers  regardless of their billing method  subscription revenue is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as services are performed  we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the applicable service period 
when we provide a free trial period  we do not begin to recognize subscription revenue until the trial period has ended and the customer has been billed for the services 
commission revenue we have contracts with third party entities with respect to telemarketing product sales to our customers following the sale of the initial software licenses 
these products and services are intended to assist the customers with their internet businesses 
these products are sold and delivered completely by third parties 
we receive commissions from these third parties  and recognize the revenue as the commissions are received  net of expected customer refunds 
change in avail contract in april  we began marketing and selling avail  an all in one communications service which assists small businesses and entrepreneurs to manage phone menus  voicemail  email  and fax in one online application 
customers purchasing the avail product are charged a non refundable activation fee along with a monthly service fee 
the non refundable activation fee is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer life  which is currently estimated to be four and one half years 
the monthly service fee is recognized ratably over the service period 
in january we changed the contract that is associated with the sale of our avail subscription 
effective march  any customer that has not activated their avail subscription was assessed an activation fee of an additional 
prior to this change in contract  this activation fee was included in a bundle of items sold at the workshop and there was no time limit on activation 
all existing customers were notified of the change in contract in january and were given days to activate avail without paying the additional activation fee 
as a result of this change in contract  we recognized approximately  in revenue upon expiration of the day notice in march for the avail activation fees described above as we no longer had an obligation to provide the activation 
fees collected related to sales tax and other government assessed taxes are recognized on a net basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts since  we have offered to our customers the option to finance  through eptas  purchases made at the internet training workshops through july  when this sales channel was suspended 
we record the receivable and deferred revenue  along with an allowance for doubtful accounts  at the time the epta contract is perfected 
the allowance represents estimated losses resulting from the customers failure to make required payments 
the allowances for doubtful accounts for eptas we retain are netted against the current and long term trade receivable balances in our consolidated balance sheets 
all allowance estimates are based on historical collection experience  specific identification of probable bad debts based on collection efforts  aging of trade receivables  customer payment history  and other known factors  including current economic conditions 
if allowances prove inadequate  additional allowances would be required 
because revenue generated from customers financing through eptas is deferred and not recognized prior to the collection of cash  adjustments to allowances for doubtful accounts are made through deferred revenue and do not impact operating income or loss 
trade receivables are written off against the allowance when the related customers are no longer making required payments and the trade receivables are determined to be uncollectible  typically days past their original due date 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
our deferred income tax assets consist primarily of the future benefit of net operating loss carryforwards  certain deferred revenue  accrued expenses and tax credit carryforwards 
we may recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting guidance is also provided on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence  including historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
results of operations results of consolidated operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report

although we had a pre tax loss for the year ended december  of  we had provision for income taxes primarily as a result of placing a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets during the year ended december  and an additional valuation allowance placed on our remaining foreign tax credits 
we had a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily as a result of an uncertain tax liability due to the use of foreign tax credits 
segment operating results the information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments 
segment operating income loss is equal to segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses

fees for our storesonline products and services sold under eptas are recognized as revenue as cash payments are received from the customer and not at the time of sale 
revenue related to cash collected under epta agreements decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  our typical epta agreement has a term of two to three years 
as such  while we no longer plan to offer eptas to our customers as a result of the suspension of our direct mail seminar sales  we will continue to recognize revenue from these epta contracts as cash is collected 
eptas are originally recognized in our balance sheet  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  through our deferred revenue balance 
the remaining deferred revenue balance is expected to be recognized as revenue at a decreasing quarterly rate over the next two to three years

offsetting this decrease in cash sales at events was an increase of approximately  in revenue due to a reduction in our deferred revenue balance as we completed fulfillment of the products and services sold at these events  as well as a  decrease in sales returns from the previous year 
commissions from third parties decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  as a result of the suspension of direct mail seminars  and commissions from third parties is not expected to be significant in the future

the decrease in total selling and marketing expenses as well as selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue are primarily due to the suspension of direct mail seminars in july  which resulted in a more significant reduction in selling and marketing expenses than the reduction in revenue as a result of the continuation of revenue received on the collection of principal on epta contracts

this new accounting guidance applies to arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning on january  additionally  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
the adoption of this new guidance had a material impact for the interim reporting periods but did not have a material impact on our financial statements for the year ended december  on january   we adopted new guidance which amends existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
this authoritative guidance modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the adoption of this authoritative guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

the new guidance will be effective for us beginning january  and will not have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption
