table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands of dollars background fuel tech  inc fuel tech has two broad technology segments that provide advanced engineered solutions to meet the pollution control  efficiency improvement and operational optimization needs of energy related facilities worldwide 
they are as follows air pollution control technologies the air pollution control technology segment includes technologies to reduce nox emissions in flue gas from boilers  incinerators  furnaces and other stationary combustion sources 
these include low and ultra low nox burners lnb and ulnb  over fire air ofa systems  noxout and hert selective non catalytic reduction sncr systems  and advanced selective catalytic reduction ascr systems 
the ascr system includes ulnb  ofa  and sncr components  along with a downsized scr catalyst  ammonia injection grid aig  and graduated straightening grid gsg systems to provide high nox reductions at significantly lower capital and operating costs than conventional scr systems 
the noxout cascade and noxout scr processes are basic types of ascr systems  using just sncr and scr catalyst components 
ultra technology creates ammonia at a plant site using safe urea for use with any scr application 
flue gas conditioning systems are chemical injection systems offered in markets outside the us and canada to enhance electrostatic precipitator and fabric filter performance in controlling particulate emissions 
fuel tech distributes its products through its direct sales force and agents 
fuel chem technologies the fuel chem technology segment  which uses chemical processes in combination with advanced cfd and ckm boiler modeling  for the control of slagging  fouling  corrosion  opacity and other sulfur trioxide related issues in furnaces and boilers through the addition of chemicals into the furnace using tifi targeted in furnace injection technology 
fuel tech sells its fuel chem program through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
fuel chem programs are installed on combustion units in north america  europe  china  and india  treating a wide variety of solid and liquid fuels  including coal  heavy oil  biomass and municipal waste 
the fuel chem program improves the efficiency  reliability and environmental status of plants operating in the electric utility  industrial  pulp and paper  waste to energy  university and district heating markets and offers numerous operational  financial and environmental benefits to owners of boilers  furnaces and other combustion units 
the key market dynamic for both technology segments is the continued use of fossil fuels  especially coal  as the principal fuel source for global electricity production 
coal currently accounts for approximately of all us electricity generation and roughly of chinese electricity generation 
coal s share of global electricity generation is just over today and is forecasted to decline marginally to a level just under by major coal consumers include china  the united states and india 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are deemed critical 
we routinely discuss our critical accounting policies with the company s audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues from the sales of chemical products are recorded when title transfers  either at the point of shipment or at the point of destination  depending on the contract with the customer 
fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for equipment construction and license contracts that are sold within the air pollution control technology segment 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual construction costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
construction costs include all direct costs such as materials  labor  and subcontracting costs  and indirect costs allocable to the particular contract such as indirect labor  tools and equipment  and supplies 
revisions in completion estimates and contract values are made in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revisions become known and can influence the timing of when revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revisions have historically not had a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized 
provisions are made for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
as of december   fuel tech had one construction contract in progress that was identified as loss contract in the amount of as of december   fuel tech had no construction contracts in progress that were identified as loss contracts 

table of contents fuel tech s apc contracts are typically eight to sixteen months in length 
a typical contract will have three or four critical operational measurements that  when achieved  serve as the basis for us to invoice the customer via progress billings 
at a minimum  these measurements will include the generation of engineering drawings  the shipment of equipment and the completion of a system performance test 
as part of most of its contractual apc project agreements  fuel tech will agree to customer specific acceptance criteria that relate to the operational performance of the system that is being sold 
these criteria are determined based on mathematical modeling that is performed by fuel tech personnel  which is based on operational inputs that are provided by the customer 
the customer will warrant that these operational inputs are accurate as they are specified in the binding contractual agreement 
further  the customer is solely responsible for the accuracy of the operating condition information  all performance guarantees and equipment warranties granted by us are void if the operating condition information is inaccurate or is not met 
accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables  representing revenues recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
at december  and december   unbilled receivables were approximately  and  respectively  and are included in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts were  and at december  and december   respectively  and are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
fuel tech has installed over units with apc technology and normally provides performance guarantees to our customers based on the operating conditions for the project 
as part of the project implementation process  we perform system start up and optimization services that effectively serve as a test of actual project performance 
we believe that this test  combined with the accuracy of the modeling that is performed  enables revenue to be recognized prior to the receipt of formal customer acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of credit losses in accounts receivable 
in order to control and monitor the credit risk associated with our customer base  we review the credit worthiness of customers on a recurring basis 
factors influencing the level of scrutiny include the level of business the customer has with fuel tech  the customer s payment history and the customer s financial stability 
receivables are considered past due if payment is not received by the date agreed upon with the customer  which is normally days 
representatives of our management team review all past due accounts on a weekly basis to assess collectability 
at the end of each reporting period  the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is reviewed relative to management s collectability assessment and is adjusted if deemed necessary through a corresponding charge or credit to bad debts expense  which is included in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
bad debt write offs are made when management believes it is probable a receivable will not be recovered 
our historical credit loss has been insignificant 
assessment of potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but rather are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators arise  for impairment 
the company does not have any indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
such indicators include a decline in expected cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a decrease in our market capitalization to an amount less than the carrying value of our assets  or slower growth rates  among others 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
fuel tech has two reporting units which are reported in the fuel chem segment and the apc technology segment 
as of december  and  goodwill allocated to the fuel chem technology segment was  and goodwill allocated to the apc technology segment was  our evaluation of goodwill impairment involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
we may bypass this qualitative assessment  or determine that based on our qualitative assessment considering the totality of events and circumstances including macroeconomic factors  industry and market considerations  current and projected financial performance  a sustained decrease in our share price  or other factors  that additional impairment analysis is necessary 
this additional analysis involves comparing the current fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
fuel tech uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to determine the current fair value of its two reporting units as this methodology was deemed to best quantify the present values of the company s expected future cash flows and yield a fair value that should be in line with the aggregate market value placed on the company via the current stock price multiplied by the outstanding common shares 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and working capital changes 
events outside the company s control  specifically market conditions that impact revenue growth assumptions  could significantly impact the fair value calculated 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

table of contents the application of our dcf model in estimating the fair value of each reporting segment is based on the income approach to business valuation 
in using this approach for each reportable segment  we forecast segment revenues and expenses out to perpetuity and then discount the resulting cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate 
the forecast considers  among other items  the current and expected business environment  expected changes in the fixed and variable cost structure as the business grows  and a revenue growth rate that we feel is both achievable and sustainable 
the discount rate used is composed of a number of identifiable risk factors  including equity risk  company size  and certain company specific risk factors such as our debt to equity ratio  among other factors  that when added together  results in a total return that a prudent investor would demand for an investment in our company 
in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value  additional analysis would be required 
the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill  which may involve the use of valuation experts 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair values assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized  which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
based upon the nature of the goodwill recorded on the balance sheets as of december  and  the company believes that  in order for an impairment to occur  our actual revenue growth in future periods would need to differ materially from the projected revenue growth estimates included in our current cash flow forecasts  particularly as it relates to the apc reporting unit 
in addition  other economic events may be indicators of impairment  such as suppressed consolidated revenues  a reduction in our market capitalization to an amount that is lower than our current enterprise value  reduced overall cash flows  or declining apc order backlog 
management does not believe that any of these events have resulted in any indications of asset impairment as it pertains to fuel tech s business 
impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment pp e and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset groups may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exists  we perform a more detailed analysis and an impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount 
this process of analyzing impairment involves examining the operating condition of individual assets or asset groups and estimating a fair value based upon current condition  relevant market factors and remaining estimated operational life compared to the asset s remaining depreciable life 
quoted market prices and other valuation techniques are used to determine expected cash flows 
however  due to the nature of our pp e  which is comprised mainly of assets related to our headquarters building and equipment deployed at customer locations for our fuel chem programs  and the shorter term duration over which fuel chem equipment is depreciated  the likelihood of impairment is mitigated 
the discontinuation of a fuel chem program at a customer site would most likely result in the re deployment of all or most of the affected assets to another customer location rather than an impairment 
valuation allowance for deferred income taxes deferred tax assets represent deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at the end of each reporting period  fuel tech reviews the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
as part of this review  we consider if there are taxable temporary differences that could generate taxable income in the future  if there is the ability to carry back the net operating losses or credits  if there is a projection of future taxable income  and if there are any tax planning strategies that can be readily implemented 
stock based compensation fuel tech recognizes compensation expense for employee equity awards ratably over the requisite service period of the award  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock options using the black scholes model requires judgment  including estimates for risk free interest rate an estimate based on the yield of zero coupon treasury securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option  expected volatility an estimate based on the historical volatility of fuel tech s common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option  and expected life of the option an estimate based on historical experience including the effect of employee terminations 
in addition  fuel tech utilizes a monte carlo valuation pricing model to determine the fair value of certain restricted stock units rsus that contain market conditions 
determining the fair value of these rsus requires judgment and involves simulating potential future stock prices based on estimates for the risk free interest rate  stock volatility  and correlations between our stock price and the stock prices of a peer group of companies 

table of contents if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income oci as part of the statement of changes in equity 
under the amended guidance  all changes in oci are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the changes are effective january  with earlier adoption permitted 
in addition  in december  the fasb issued an amendment to this accounting standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
we adopted the provisions of this amendment on january   which will only affect our financial statement presentation and will have no impact to our consolidated financial results 
in may  the fasb issued guidance titled amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standard ifrs  to converge fair value measurement and disclosure guidance in us gaap with the guidance in the international accounting standards board s concurrently issued ifrs  fair value measurement 
this accounting guidance does not modify the requirements for when fair value measurements apply  rather  it generally provides clarifications on how to measure and disclose fair value under the accounting standards codification  fair value measurement 
the amendments in this accounting guidance are effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted for public entities 
we adopted the provisions of this amendment on january  and it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued new authoritative guidance titled testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the results of the qualitative analysis indicate it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step impairment test  which was required under previous us gaap  would not be necessary 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted

during  fuel tech added new coal fired units to its customer base 
revenue from coal fired units increased by  or during a fuel chem demonstration period  the company will typically absorb all of the direct costs eg  chemicals  on site personnel  equipment depreciation and demonstration related travel expenses and indirect costs of operating the demonstration and will offset these costs with partial billings to the customer 
while each demonstration is unique  a typical demonstration will operate for days and the company will accumulate future billing amounts that will usually be invoiced to the customer only if the fuel chem program converts to commercial status 
these amounts may range from less than to over  depending on the quantity of chemical fed  the agreed upon cost sharing arrangement and the length of the demonstration program 
during the demonstration period  the aggregate cost of all fuel chem demonstration programs will have a dilutive effect on the segment gross margin percentage as the related revenues earned will approximate the costs incurred and result in nominal gross margin dollars being recorded 
in certain situations  the company agrees to fully fund a demonstration program due to the strategic importance of its success and conversion to commercial status
