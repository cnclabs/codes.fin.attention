the contingent consideration could result in additional payments of up to million 
we recorded  of identifiable intangible assets  million of goodwill which is deductible for tax purposes and  of other net tangible assets 
the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using probability assessments of expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is to be settled and applied a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participant s view of the risk associated with the obligation 
during the year ended december   the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted based on an updated assessment of the probability of achievement of the performance metrics and the discount factor reflecting the passage of time

the additional expense of  was included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the fair value adjustment to contingent consideration was not material for the year ended december  in  we made payments in the amount of  related to the contingent consideration 
as of december   the fair value of the liability remaining for the contingent consideration was  and is included in accrued expenses 
acquisition related costs incurred for these acquisitions were not material 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues from subscription agreements and related services and from news distribution services 
our subscription agreements contain multiple service elements and deliverables  which generally include use of our cloud based software  news distribution services  hosting services  content and content updates and customer support and may also include implementation and training services 
the typical term of our subscription agreements is one year  however  our customers may purchase subscriptions with monthly or multi year terms 
we separately invoice our customers in advance of their subscription  with payment terms that generally require our customers to pay us generally within days of invoice 
our subscription agreements typically are non cancelable  though customers have the right to terminate their agreements for cause if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement 
our subscription agreements may include amounts that are not yet contractually billable to customers  and any such unbilled amounts are not recorded in deferred revenue until invoiced 
additionally  we derive revenue on a per transaction basis from our news distribution services 
we generally receive payment in advance of the online distribution of the news release 
professional services revenue consists primarily of data migration  custom development and training 
our professional service engagements are billed on a fixed fee basis with payment terms requiring our customers to pay us within days of invoice 
during the year ended december   professional services accounted for approximately of our revenues 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues has consisted primarily of compensation for training  editorial and support personnel  hosting infrastructure  press release distribution  acquisition  maintenance and amortization of the information database  amortization of purchased technology from business combinations  amortization of capitalized software development costs  depreciation associated with computer equipment and software and allocated overhead 
we allocate overhead expenses such as employee benefits  computer and office supplies  management information systems and depreciation for computer equipment based on headcount 
as a result  indirect overhead expenses are included in cost of revenues and each operating expense category 
we believe content is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to broad  current and relevant information critical to their marketing efforts 
we expect to continue to make investments in 
table of contents both our own content as well as content acquired from third parties and to continue to enhance our proprietary information database and enhance our news monitoring and social media monitoring services 
we expect in  cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars but will remain flat or decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses are our largest operating expense 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions and incentives  marketing programs  including lead generation  promotional events  webinars and other brand building expenses and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time a subscription agreement is executed by the customer  and we recognize substantially all of our revenues ratably over the term of the corresponding subscription agreement 
as a result  we incur sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to add new customers  increase sales to our existing customers and increase sales of our online news release distribution services 
such investments will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to build brand awareness and generate additional sales leads 
we expect in  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our software application development personnel and allocated overhead 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud based software 
because of our hosted solutions  we are able to provide our customers with a single  shared version of our most recent application  which enables us to have relatively low expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software business models 
we expect that in  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and increase slightly as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  as well as fees for legal  accounting and other consulting services  including acquisition related transaction costs  third party payment processing and credit card fees  facilities rent  other corporate expenses  fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and allocated overhead 
we expect that in  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will decrease as a percentage of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortized intangible assets consist of customer relationships  trade names and agreements not to compete acquired in business combinations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and include the accounts of vocus  inc and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain changes to prior year balance sheet amounts have been made in accordance with the accounting for business combinations to reflect adjustments made during the measurement period to preliminary amounts recorded for the estimated fair value of acquired net assets of one of our business acquisitions 
for more information  please refer to note goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to the 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs  useful lives of property  equipment and software  intangible assets and goodwill  contingent liabilities  revenue recognition  fair value of stock based awards and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fee is probable and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our subscription agreements generally contain multiple service elements and deliverables 
these elements include use of our cloud based software  hosting services  content and content updates  customer support and may also include news distribution services and professional services 
our subscription agreements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time 
prior to january   all elements in our multiple element subscription agreements were considered a single unit of accounting  and accordingly  we recognized all associated fees over the subscription period  which is typically one year 
we determined that we did not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements in our arrangements and  as a result  subscription revenues were recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
professional services sold separately from a subscription arrangement were recognized as the services were performed 
the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide updates on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated  eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method  and require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices esp of each deliverable if it does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe of selling price 
on january   we adopted the provisions of the new accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  that contain subscription services sold with news distribution services or professional services on a prospective basis and determined the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
our separate units of accounting consist of subscription services  news distribution services and professional services 
we allocate consideration to each deliverable in multiple element arrangements based on the relative selling prices and recognize revenue as the respective services are delivered or performed 
we established vsoe of selling price for certain of our news distribution services as the selling price for a substantial majority of stand alone sales falls within a narrow range around the median selling price 
we determined tpe of selling price is not available for any of our services due to differences in the features and functionality compared to competitor s products 
we determined esp for the remaining deliverables by analyzing factors such as historical pricing trends  discounting practices  gross margin objectives and other market conditions 

table of contents we also distribute individual news releases to the internet which are indexed by major search engines and distributed directly to various news sites  journalists and other key constituents 
we recognize revenue on a per transaction basis when the press releases are made available to the public 
sales and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenues 
sales commissions 
sales commissions are expensed when a subscription agreement is executed by the customer 
as a result  we incur sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense for equity awards based on the fair value of the award and on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on the estimated portion of the award that is expected to vest 
we apply estimated forfeiture rates based on analyses of historical data  including termination patterns and other factors 
we use the quoted closing market price of our common stock on the grant date to measure the fair value of our restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our option awards 
we use the daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the options to calculate the expected volatility 
the expected term of option awards granted through march  was calculated using the simplified method  which is equal to the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award 
based on stock option exercise activity through the three months ended june   we determined that we had sufficient historical exercise data to estimate the expected term for option awards using a combination of historical exercise data with expected future exercise patterns using the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term for outstanding awards for all option awards granted after march  this change in estimate did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rate on us treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards 
we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  use an expected dividend yield of zero 
business combinations 
we have completed acquisitions of businesses that have resulted in the recording of goodwill and identifiable definite lived intangible assets 
definite lived intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships  trade names  agreements not to compete and purchased technology 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
we recognize all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for these acquisitions requires us to make determinations about the fair value of assets acquired  useful lives for definite lived tangible and intangible assets  and liabilities assumed that involve estimates and judgments 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is assessed for impairment at least annually 
goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount  then goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we perform our annual impairment assessment on november  or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we operate under one reporting unit and  as a result  evaluate goodwill impairment based on our fair value as a whole 

table of contents we use an income approach based on discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs and other relevant factors which are consistent with the plans used to manage our operations 
the results of our most recent annual assessment performed on november  did not indicate any impairment of goodwill  and as such  the second step of the impairment test was not required 
we also review the carrying amount of our reporting unit to its fair value based on quoted market prices of our common stock  or market capitalization 
our market capitalization exceeded our carrying amount 
no events or circumstances occurred from the date of the assessment through december  that would impact this conclusion 
subsequent to december   we experienced a decline in our market capitalization due to a recent decline in our stock price  however  our market capitalization continues to exceed the carrying amount of our reporting unit 
we assess impairment of definite lived intangible and other long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may no longer be fully recoverable 
we determine the impairment  if any  by comparing the carrying value of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
there were no impairment charges for long lived assets for the years ended december  and impairment charges for long lived assets for the year ended december  were not material 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
net deferred tax assets are reduced by the valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the fourth quarter of  based on recent operating results and our current projections of future losses  we established a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state net deferred tax assets as we concluded at this time that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
we have historically maintained a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of certain of our foreign subsidiaries because we determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our foreign deferred tax assets 
our estimates related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits 
if we determine it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits  we record the impact of the position in our consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our estimates are updated at each reporting date based on the facts  circumstances and information available 
we are also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to our unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdictions and various state and foreign jurisdictions and are subject to us federal  state  and foreign tax examinations for years ranging from to

for conversions occurring on or before february   each share of series a convertible preferred stock may be converted into shares of common stock subject to customary adjustments 
on and after february   each share of series a convertible preferred stock which has not been redeemed may be converted into shares of common stock subject to customary adjustments 
please refer to note  subsequent events  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for more information 

table of contents on february   in connection with the icontact acquisition  we established a million revolving credit facility with a major lending institution which will be available for use until february  the revolving credit facility is intended to be used for general working capital purposes and to provide increased liquidity and financial flexibility 
the revolving credit facility has a one year term  renewable annually and bears interest equal to the bba libor daily floating rate plus 
in addition  we will pay a fee equal to on any unused funds under the revolving credit facility 
as collateral for extension of credit under the facility  we granted security interests in favor of the institution of substantially all of our assets  and we pledged the stock of our directly owned domestic subsidiaries and of the shares of our foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   million remained available for purchases under our stock repurchase program 
although we have repurchased stock during the years ended december   and  we may or may not do so in future periods  and our revolving credit facility limits our ability to engage in stock repurchases 
as of december   we had us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively which may be available to offset potential payments of future income tax liabilities and which  if unused  will begin to expire in as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we intend to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments together with our expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures  contractual obligations  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through our revolving credit facility or additional equity financing
