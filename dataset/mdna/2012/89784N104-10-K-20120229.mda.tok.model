we cannot assure that our operations will not be affected by inflation in the future 
financial condition net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in this increase in net cash provided by operating activities is linked to the increase in net income and the sales mix shift to the us consumer direct segment which accelerates the conversion of net sales to cash as compared to wholesale sales 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
in  we sold a short term investment of million  which reduced the investing cash outflows 
capital expenditures in increased by million over  primarily due to a retail merchandise allocation system that was implemented in the fourth quarter of net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to net cash used of million in this decrease is due to a decrease in cash used for statutory tax withholding payments for stock based compensation  which was partially offset by a decrease in the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
the amount of statutory tax withholding payments for stock based compensation is linked to the number of shares of restricted stock that vest in a period and the closing price for those shares when they vest 
the decrease in payments made in is primarily due to a decrease in the number of shares vesting during compared to liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing cash requirements are currently expected to be for our ongoing operations  capital expenditures for new retail stores  our expansion internationally  and information technology and other infrastructure needs 
management believes that cash flow from continuing operations and on hand cash and cash equivalents will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures 
over the long term  we manage our cash and capital structure to strengthen our financial position  maximize shareholder return  and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents  and future operating cash flows  as well as any potential future borrowing facilities  will be sufficient  for at least the next twelve months  to fund scheduled future payments and potential long term initiatives 
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors  including our profitability  operating cash flows  debt levels  debt ratings  and market conditions  and we cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  if needed 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million

seasonality of business due to the holiday shopping season in december  our us wholesale segment sales historically have been higher in the second half of the year and our us consumer direct segment sales historically have been higher in the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period 
our management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other factors and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies management believes are critical 
for a summary of all our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
sales recognition sales are recognized across all segments of the business when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  price has been fixed or is determinable  and collectability can be reasonably assured 
wholesale sales within our us wholesale and international segments are recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer 
sales are recorded net of estimates for returns  discounts  operational chargebacks and markdown allowances 
returns and allowances require pre approval by management and discounts are based on trade terms 
we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis using historical trends  seasonal results  and current economic and market conditions 
our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 
retail store sales are recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers 
e commerce sales of products ordered through our retail internet site known as www 
truereligionbrandjeans 
com are recognized upon estimated delivery of the shipment to the customers 
e commerce sales also are reduced by an estimate of returns 
retail store sales and e commerce sales exclude sales taxes 
we recognize revenue associated with our gift cards upon 
table of contents redemption of the gift card 
in addition  we may recognize revenue from gift cards in the future when we determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that we have no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card to relevant jurisdictions 
we will utilize historical redemption patterns to consider the likelihood of gift card redemption 
during  and  no revenue was recognized related to gift card breakage 
revenues from licensing arrangements are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements  generally based upon the higher of a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty levels and b a percentage of wholesale sales of licensed product by our licensees 
uncollectible accounts management evaluates our accounts receivables to assess if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgment is used  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts 
based on this information  management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible 
inventories slow moving merchandise is typically sold at prices exceeding our cost in our outlet stores or to wholesale customers who specialize in off price merchandise 
as of december  and  we recorded inventory impairment reserves for slow moving inventory of million and million  respectively  based upon analysis of balances on hand by style  recent sales trends  projected future sales  and historical markdown trends 
valuation of long lived assets management assesses the impairment of our long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the assets are considered impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the asset s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows in future periods 
if the assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered impaired  an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
as the majority of the long lived assets in our stores are leasehold improvements that we specifically created for our operation and would not be utilized by other retailers in their typical operations  we estimate that the fair value of impaired long lived assets is immaterial 
future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management s estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life  if shorter 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we did not record an impairment charge 
stock based compensation we recognize restricted stock compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for awards with only service conditions using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the entire award 
the requisite service period is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award  which often is the vesting period 
if a portion of the restricted stock vests immediately or in another period such that the cumulative vested amount exceeds the cumulative straight line expense amount  we record compensation expense equal to at least the cumulative 
table of contents compensation expense of the vested amount of the restricted stock 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards with performance based conditions is recognized on an accelerated basis using the graded attribution method over the requisite service period 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is determined that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
fasb asc accounting for income taxes fasb asc establishes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
in accordance with fasb asc  we regularly evaluate the likelihood of recognizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal  state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts  circumstances  and information available 
for those benefits that we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained  we recognize the largest amount we believe is cumulatively greater than likely to be realized 
we record interest and penalties  if any  on any underpayment of income taxes as a component of provision for income taxes and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively
