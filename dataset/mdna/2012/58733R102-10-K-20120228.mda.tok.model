item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates foreign currency translation 
while we have entered in the past into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure  these are expensive  and in addition it is very difficult to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure 
inflation and certain government measures to curb inflation may have adverse effects on the economies of the countries where we operate  our business and our operations 
most latin american countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation 
inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of latin american countries 
governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation  coupled with speculation about possible future actions  have contributed to economic uncertainty over the years in most latin american countries 
the latin american countries where we operate may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy  including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation  particularly in venezuela  which recently was determined to be highly inflationary  we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures 
a return to a high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
developments in other markets may affect the latin american countries where we operate  our financial condition and results of operations 
the market value of securities of companies such as ourselves  may be  to varying degrees  affected by economic and market conditions in other global markets 
although economic conditions vary from country to country  investors perceptions of the events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and securities from issuers in other countries  including latin american countries 
various latin american economies have been adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred in several emerging economies in recent times  including mexico in  the collapse of several asian economies between and  the economic crisis in russia in  the brazilian devaluations in january of and in  the argentine crisis of and the market decline after september  furthermore  latin american economies may be affected by events in developed economies which are trading partners or that impact the global economy 
developments of a similar magnitude to the international markets in the future can be expected to adversely affect the economies of latin american countries and therefore us 
e commerce transactions in latin america may be impeded by the lack of secure payment methods 
unlike in the united states  consumers and merchants in latin america can be held fully liable for credit card and other losses due to third party fraud 
as secure methods of payment for e commerce transactions have not been widely adopted in latin america  both consumers and merchants generally have a relatively low confidence level in the integrity of e commerce transactions 
in addition  many banks and other financial institutions have generally been reluctant to give merchants the right to process online transactions due to these concerns about credit card fraud 
unless consumer fraud laws in latin american countries are modified to protect e commerce merchants and consumers  and until secure  integrated online payment processing methods are fully implemented across the region  our ability to generate revenues from e commerce may be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our company 
risks related to our shares the price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate substantially  and our stockholders investment may decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors  many of which are beyond our control  including those described above under risks related to our business 
further  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for internet related and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
we cannot assure you that trading prices and valuations will be sustained 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate  such as recession or currency exchange rate fluctuations  may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  that company is often subject to securities class action litigation 
this kind of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in connection with the declaration and payment of quarterly or special dividends on our common stock 
we continue to be significantly influenced by a group of stockholders that control a significant percentage of our common stock and the value of our common stock could be negatively affected by any significant disposition of our shares by any of these stockholders 
certain stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock 
as of december   ebay owned approximately million shares of our common stock which represents of our outstanding common stock as of december  
certain members and certain entities affiliated with members of our management also hold a significant percentage of our common stock 
these stockholders retain the power to influence the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
the interests of these stockholders may conflict with  or differ from  the interests of other holders of our common stock 
for example  these stockholders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or outstanding shares of common stock  sell revenue generating assets or inhibit change of control transactions that benefit other stockholders 
they may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business  and as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
so long as these stockholders continue to own a substantial number of shares of our common stock  they will significantly influence all our corporate decisions and together with other stockholders may be able to effect or inhibit changes in control of our company 
additionally  the actual sale  communication of an intention to sell or perceptions that any of the above mentioned stockholders may sell any significant amount of our common stock could negatively impact the market value of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us  prevent a change of control  and may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our management 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit a change of control that our board of directors does not approve or changes in the composition of our board of directors  which could result in the entrenchment of current management 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations  a staggered board of directors  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors other than for cause  limitations on the ability of stockholders to own and or exercise voting power over of our common stock  limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal our by laws  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent  the authority of the board of directors to adopt a stockholder rights plan  the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with any terms that the board of directors determines and additional shares of our common stock  and limitations on the ability of certain stockholders to enter into certain business combinations with us  as provided under section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
see description of capital stock for more information 
we may require additional capital in the future  and this additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion organically or through strategic acquisitions  to develop new or enhanced services or products  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution and the securities that we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
these inabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
certain stockholders or entities controlled by them or their permitted transferees beneficially own shares of our common stock that have not been registered for resale with the sec 
the holders of these restricted shares may sell their shares in the public market from time to time without registering them  subject in the case of our affiliates  to certain limitations on the timing  amount and method of those sales imposed by regulations promulgated by the sec 
holders of restricted stock will also have the right to cause us to register the resale of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them 
in the future  we may issue securities in connection with investments and acquisitions 
the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 
our stockholders may not receive dividends or dividends may not grow over time 
during  the company paid quarterly dividends on shares of our common stock throughout the year 
despite the company announced its intention to pay regular quarterly dividends on shares of our common stock in the future  we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to pay dividends in the future may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the risk factors described herein 
all dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings  our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
our board is under no obligation or requirement to declare a dividend 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve results that will allow us to pay a specified level of dividends  if any  or to grow our dividends over time 
requirements associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention 
in connection with our initial public offering  we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  and the other rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq global market 
we are also subject to various other regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sarbanes oxley act 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting  we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated 
as a result  our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm the trading price of our stock 
in addition  in connection with our initial public offering in august  we became subject to the rules of the nasdaq global market 
our compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly 
it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us in us courts 
although we are a delaware corporation  our subsidiaries and most of our assets are located outside of the united states 
furthermore  most of our directors and officers and some experts named in this report reside outside the united states 
as a result  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us or our directors or officers in us courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws 
it is unclear if original actions of civil liabilities based solely upon us federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the united states 
it is equally unclear if judgments entered by us courts based on the civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the united states 
any enforcement action in a court outside the united states will be subject to compliance with procedural requirements under applicable local law  including the condition that the judgment does not violate the public policy of the applicable jurisdiction

out of that total   shares of common stock were sold by us and  were sold by selling shareholders

the option was exercised in full  and of that total  an additional  shares were sold by us and  were sold by the selling shareholders

cmg and its subsidiaries operate an online classified advertisements platform primarily dedicated to the sale of automobiles at www 
tucarro 
com in venezuela  colombia and puerto rico and real estate at www

the aggregate purchase price paid in cash was million and includes urls  domain names  trademarks  databases non compete agreements and intellectual property rights that are used or useful in connection with the online platforms of the acquired business 
reporting segments our segment reporting is based on geographic areas  which is the current criteria we are using to evaluate our segment performance 
our geography segments include brazil  argentina  mexico  venezuela and other countries such as chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  panama  peru  portugal and uruguay 
in addition  we operate a real estate classifieds platform that covers some areas of florida in the united states  the operations of which are included in our segment for other countries 
during  our gross merchandise volume reached  million and visitors to our web site were able to browse an average of over million listings on any given day  organized by country  in over  different product categories 
we believe that we have achieved a critical mass of active buyers  sellers and product listings in most of the countries where we operate and that our business can be readily scaled to handle increases in our user base and transaction volume 
at december   we had million confirmed registered mercadolibre users 
for  we had million unique sellers  million unique buyers and million successful items sold 
for  our net revenues were million 
of the million in revenues  approximately was attributable to our brazilian business  to our argentine business  to our venezuelan business  to our mexican business  and to other countries 
although we discuss long term trends in our business  it is our policy to not provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense 
we believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near term results difficult 
further  we seek to make decisions focused primarily on the long term welfare of our company and believe focusing on short term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders 
we believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for long term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value 
we  therefore  encourage potential investors to consider this strategy before making an investment in our common stock 
a long term focus may make it more difficult for industry analysts and the market to evaluate the value of our company  which could reduce the value of our common stock or permit competitors with short term tactics to grow stronger than us 
description of line items net revenues we recognize revenues in each of our five reporting segments 
our reporting segments include our operations in brazil  argentina  mexico  venezuela and other countries chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  panama  peru  portugal and uruguay 
we offer three types of up front fees for three different combinations of placement and features 
up front fees are charged at the time the listing is uploaded onto our platform and are not subject to successful sale of the items listed 
following this fee structure modification  revenues for the mercadolibre marketplace transactions are now generated by up front fees  final value fees  and online advertising fees 
since the third quarter of  we have offered payment processing through our mercadopago solution at no added cost in brazil and argentina 
on april  and november   we launched a new and improved version of our mercadopago payments platform that may be used for all our marketplace transactions in mexico and venezuela  respectively 
we also made offering mercadopago obligatory in our mexican marketplace listings with the exception of free listings 
this change in pricing results  with respect to marketplace transactions  in our no longer charging our users a specific fee for processing on platform payments as we did in the past 
we do continue  however  to generate payment related revenues  reported within each of our reporting segments  attributable to commissions charged to sellers for the use of the mercadopago platform with respect to transactions that occur outside of our marketplace platform  revenues from a financial charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our mercadopago platform  for transactions that occur on or off of our marketplace platform 
prior to the third quarter of  we used to generate revenues from the mercadolibre marketplace transactions from listing fees  optional feature fees  final value fees  and online advertising fees 
during the third quarter of  we modified our pricing structure by replacing our previous listing fees and optional feature fees with consolidated up front fees which bundle these features  as discussed above

we have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our platforms 
for the years ended december   and  no single customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in our mercadolibre marketplace or our mercadopago payment solution 
our mercadolibre marketplace is available in thirteen countries argentina  brazil  chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  mexico  panama  peru  portugal  uruguay and venezuela  and mercadopago is available in six countries argentina  brazil  chile  colombia  mexico and venezuela 
the functional currency for each country s operations is the local currency  except for venezuela whose functional currency is the us dollar due to venezuela s status as a highly inflationary economy 
see critical accounting policies and estimates foreign currency translation included in this report 
therefore  our net revenues are generated in multiple foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the average monthly exchange rate 
our subsidiaries in brazil  argentina  venezuela and colombia are subject to certain taxes on revenues which are classified as costs of net revenues 
these taxes represented  and of net revenues for  and  respectively 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues primarily represents bank and credit card processing charges for transactions and fees paid with credit cards and other payment methods  certain taxes on revenues  compensation for customer support personnel  isp connectivity charges  depreciation and amortization and hosting and site operation fees 
product and technology development expenses our product and technology development related expenses consist primarily of depreciation and amortization costs related to product and technology development  compensation for our engineering and web development staff  telecommunications costs and payments to third party suppliers who provide technology maintenance services to our company 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing costs for our platforms through online and offline advertising  bad debt charges  the salaries of employees involved in these activities  public relations costs  marketing activities for our users and depreciation and amortization costs 
we carry out the vast majority of our marketing efforts on the internet 
in that context  we enter into agreements with portals  search engines  social networks  ad networks and other sites in order to attract internet users to the mercadolibre marketplace and convert them into confirmed registered users and active traders on our platform 
additionally  we allocate a portion of our marketing budget to cable television advertising in order to improve our brand awareness and to complement our online efforts 
we also work intensively on attracting  developing and growing our seller community through our supply efforts 
we have dedicated professionals in most of our operations that work with sellers  through trade show participation  seminars and meetings to provide them with important tools and skills to become effective sellers on our platform 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for management and administrative staff  compensation for outside directors  long term retention plan compensation  expenses for legal  accounting and other professional services  insurance expenses  office space rental expenses  travel and business expenses  as well as depreciation and amortization costs 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the following areas of our company general management  finance  administration  accounting  legal and human resources 
other income expenses  net other income expenses consists of interest income derived primarily from our investments and cash equivalents  foreign currency gains or losses  and other non operating results 
prior to the third quarter of  other income expenses included mainly interest expense related to the working capital requirements for our mercadopago operations 
since the third quarter of and for as long as we continue pre selling credit card receivables there has been  and we expect in the future will be  no interest expense included in other income expenses line  related to mercadopago s working capital requirements 
income and asset tax we are subject to federal and state taxes in the united states  as well as foreign taxes in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate 
our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes and asset taxes incurred in these jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting 
therefore  our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable  if any given that in certain jurisdictions we still have net operating loss carry forwards  plus the change during the period in our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the following table summarizes the composition of our income asset taxes for the years ended december   and september  september  september  year ended december  in millions current federal foreign deferred federal foreign asset tax federal foreign income asset tax expense seasonality the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the twelve quarters set forth below september  september  september  september  quarter ended march  june  september  december  net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and retail seasonality have affected  and are likely to continue to affect  our business 
typically  the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the christmas season 
however  the result of our operations in the fourth quarter of were impacted by the change in venezuelan translation rate as described in foreign currency translation below  for that reason  our fourth quarter revenues were lower when measured in us dollars than the third quarter revenues 
our slowest period is typically the first quarter of the year 
the months of january  february and march normally correspond to summer vacation time in argentina  brazil  chile  peru and uruguay 
additionally  the easter holiday falls in march or april  and brazil celebrates carnival for one week in february or march 
this is partially mitigated by the countries located in the northern hemisphere  such as colombia  mexico and venezuela for which the slowest months are their summer months of july  august and september 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee and our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other disclosures included in with this report 
foreign currency translation historically  all of our foreign operations have used the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  these foreign subsidiaries translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies to us dollars using year end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in non functional currencies are recognized in earnings 
net foreign currency exchange losses or gains are included in the consolidated statements of income under the caption foreign currency gain loss 
until september   our venezuelan subsidiaries assets  liabilities  income and expenses were translated at the official venezuelan exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to use the parallel exchange rate as described below rather than the official exchange rate to translate our venezuelan financial statements 
the following facts and circumstances have been considered in our analysis of the applicable exchange rate at the date we changed the translation exchange rate and as of the date of this report  we have not obtained dividends remittances at the official exchange rate and we have not at the date of this report  the industry in which we operate may not influence our ability to access to the official exchange rate  the commission for the administration of foreign exchange cadivi volume of approvals of the use of the official rate was down on a year to year basis as of july cadivi has not only delayed approvals but also removed many items from priority lists current priorities appear to be food and medicine causing delays in the repatriation of dividends for many companies 
consequently  in the fourth quarter of  we translated our venezuelan subsidiaries assets  liabilities  income and expense accounts using the parallel exchange rate 
as of the date of this report the company did not buy dollars at the cadivi official rate 
in accordance with us gaap  we have classified our venezuelan operations as highly inflationary as of january  and have used the us dollar to be the functional currency for purposes of our financial statements 
therefore  no translation effect was accounted for in other comprehensive income since october  related to our venezuelan operations 
until may   the only way by which us dollars could be purchased outside the official currency market was using an indirect mechanism consisting in the purchase and sale of securities  including national public debt bonds dpns denominated in bolivares fuertes and bonds issued by the government that were denominated in us dollars 
this mechanism for transactions in certain securities created an indirect parallel foreign currency exchange market in venezuela that enabled entities to obtain foreign currency through financial brokers without going through cadivi 
although the parallel exchange rate was higher  and accordingly less beneficial  than the official exchange rate  some entities have used the parallel market to exchange currency because  as previously mentioned  cadivi has typically failed to approve in a timely manner the exchange of currency requested by such entities 
until may   our venezuelan subsidiaries used this mechanism to buy us dollars and accordingly we used the parallel average exchange rate to re measure those foreign currency transactions 
however  on may   the venezuelan government enacted reforms to its exchange regulations and closed down such parallel market by declaring that foreign currency denominated securities issued by venezuelan entities were included in the definition of foreign currency  thus making the venezuelan central bank bcv the only institution that could legally authorize the purchase or sale of foreign currency bonds  thereby excluding non authorized brokers from the foreign exchange market 
trading of foreign currencies was re opened as a regulated market on june  with the venezuelan central bank as the only institution through which foreign currency denominated transactions can be brokered 
under the new system  known as the foreign currency securities transactions system sitme  entities domiciled in venezuela can buy us dollar denominated securities only through banks authorized by the bcv to import goods  services or capital inputs 
additionally  the sitme imposes volume restrictions on an entity s trading activity  limiting such activity to a maximum equivalent of  per day  not to exceed  in a calendar month 
this limitation is non cumulative  meaning that an entity cannot carry over unused volume from one month to the next 
as a consequence of this new system  commencing on june   we have transitioned from the parallel exchange rate to the sitme rate and started re measuring foreign currency transactions using the sitme rate published by bcv  which was bolivares fuertes per us dollar as of june  for the period beginning on may  and ended on june  during which there was no open foreign currency markets  we applied us gaap guidelines  which state that if exchangeability between two currencies is temporarily lacking at the transaction date or balance sheet date  the first subsequent rate at which exchanges could be made shall be used 
accordingly  the june  exchange rate published by the venezuelan central bank has been used to re measure transactions during the above mentioned period 
during and previous years we were able to obtain us dollars using alternative mechanisms other than the cadivi 
these dollars  obtained at a higher exchange rate than the one offered by cadivi  and held in balance at us bank accounts of our venezuelan subsidiaries  were used for dividend distributions from our venezuelan subsidiaries 
as a result  during  lack of cadivi approval did not restrict our ability to distribute the full amount of our retained earnings as dividends related to fiscal years million  and million 
in addition  during  our venezuelan subsidiaries distributed dividends of a million  related to earnings for fiscal year  using existing cash balances held in the us bank accounts of our venezuelan subsidiaries 
the following table sets forth net revenues  assets  liabilities and net assets of our venezuelan subsidiaries  before intercompany eliminations  as of december   and september  september  september  venezuelan operations net revenues assets liabilities net assets net assets of our venezuelan subsidiary amount to approximately of our consolidated net assets  and cash and investments of our venezuelan subsidiary held in local currency in venezuela amount to approximately of our consolidated cash and investments 
on june   our venezuelan subsidiary acquired an office property containing square meters in a building located in caracas  venezuela for approximately million 
the company funded the purchase price through working capital 
although the current mechanisms available to obtain us dollars for dividend distributions to our venezuelan subsidiaries to those subsidiaries of our company that are located outside venezuela imply increased restrictions  we do not expect that the current restrictions on purchasing us dollars will have a significant adverse effect on our business plans or with regard to our investment in venezuela 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired on this basis  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill or indefinite useful life intangible assets are considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
no impairments were recognized during the reporting periods and management s assessment of each reporting unit s fair value materially exceeds its carrying value 
goodwill and certain indefinite life trademarks are reviewed at the end of the year for impairment or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and certain trademarks are tested at the reporting unit level considering each segment of the company as a reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill and certain trademarks  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the company adopted the new guidance to test goodwill and  as a consequence  performs a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the company determines  on the basis of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the fair value based test is applied 
for the year ended december   based on the qualitative assessment  the company determines that the fair value of all the reporting units is greater than the carrying amount 
for the year ended december   the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
cash flow projections used were based on financial budgets approved by management 
the growth rates applied do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the business in which the reporting unit operates 
the average discount rate used for was 
that rate reflected the company s real weighted average cost of capital 
key drivers in the analysis include confirmed registered users crus  gross merchandise volume gmv which represents a measure of the total us dollar amount of all transactions completed through the mercadolibre marketplace  excluding motor vehicles  vessels  aircraft  real estate  and services and take rate defined as marketplace revenues as a percentage of gross merchandise volume 
in addition  the benchmark in the analysis includes a business to e commerce rate  which represents the growth of e commerce as a percentage of gdp  internet penetration rates as well as trends in the company s market share 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill or indefinite useful life intangible assets are considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
no impairments were recognized during the reporting periods and management s assessment of each reporting unit fair value materially exceeds its carrying value 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets and goodwill is critical since it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because i it requires management to make assumptions about gross merchandise volume growth  future interest rates  sales and costs  and ii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our net income would be material 
management s assumptions about future sales and future costs require significant judgment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and chargebacks we are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
allowances for these items represent our estimate of future losses based on our historical experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and chargebacks is recorded as a charge to sales and marketing expenses 
historically  our actual losses have been consistent with our charges 
however  future adverse changes to our historical experience for doubtful accounts and chargebacks could have a material impact on our future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and chargebacks amounted to million at december   million at december  and million at december  we write off accounts receivable with an aging of days or more 
the increase in the and allowance for doubtful accounts mainly relates to an increase in our net revenues 
in addition  during  we changed our billing cycle period  so that customers received a bill from us one time per month 
prior to  customers received bills from us multiple times per month 
the following table illustrates our bad debt charges as a percentage of net revenues for  and september  september  september  year ended december  in millions  except percentages net revenues bad debt charges bad debt charges as a percentage of net revenues historically  our actual losses have been consistent with our charges 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts and chargebacks is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about future collections and credit analysis 
our management s assumptions about future collections require significant judgment 
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our condensed consolidated statement of income 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances and historical information related to actions filed against the company at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in business legal proceedings  and in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves accordingly 
however  even if successful  our defense could be costly and could divert management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay damages or modify our business practices 
any of these consequences could materially harm our business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon taxable income and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws in each jurisdiction and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet

as of december   there are million of non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
in determining the amount of non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings  we have not considered some certain of the non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december  for us federal income tax purposes because our strategy is to reinvest our undistributed earnings of our foreign operations in those operations and to distribute dividends when they can be offset with available tax credits 
we do not expect a material impact in any repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries on our operations since the taxable domestic gains generated by any dividend distributions will be mostly offset with foreign tax credits that arise from income tax paid in our foreign operations  which we are allowed to compute for domestic income tax purposes 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us federal income taxes if such distribution exceeds available foreign tax credits 
it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed

the new guidance provides two ways to present the components of the comprehensive income  in either a a continuous statement of comprehensive income  or b two separate but consecutive statements 
the amended disclosures about the presentation of the comprehensive income in the financial statements are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the company does not expect the amendment to have a significant impact on the presentation of the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement and disclosure in may  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that amends some fair value measurement principles and it expands the asc existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the new guidance states that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise are only relevant when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and prohibits the grouping of financial instruments for purposes of determining their fair values when the unit of account is specified in other guidance 
we will adopt this accounting standard upon its effective date for periods beginning on or after december   and do not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
goodwill impairment test on september   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
under the revised guidance  entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit ie  step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
the accounting standard update does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units  nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment 
in addition  it does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant  however  it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
the company decided to early adopt this new guidance for its financial statements related to the fiscal year ending december  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from our consolidated statement of income

from to  our gross merchandise volume increased by  our successful items sold increased by and mercadopago total payment volume increased by 
from to  the growth rates for the same key operational metrics were  and  respectively 
our growth in net revenues was from to and from to we believe that the growth in net revenues should continue in the future 
however  despite this positive historical trend  current weak global macro economic environment  coupled with devaluations of certain local currencies in latin america versus the us dollar  and the effect of venezuelan translation and high interest rates in that country  could cause an experience declining year to year net revenues  particularly as measured in us dollars 
gross profit margins our business has generated sustained high gross profit margins over time  as defined by total net revenues minus total cost of net revenues  as a percentage of net revenues 
historically  gains in gross profit margins have been mainly attributable to increased economies of scale in customer service  internet service provider isp connectivity and site operations and improved economic terms obtained from payment processors 
our gross profit margins were for  for and for in and  variations in gross profit margins are mainly a result of the higher penetration of our payment solution into our marketplace  which has a higher cost of net revenue 
in the future  gross profit margins could decline if the cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues increases as the penetration of our payment solution grows faster than our marketplace  or if we cannot sustain the economies of scale that we have achieved 
improving operating income margins we have generated and expect to continue generating economies of scale in operating expenses 
for the past three years  our operating income margins  defined as our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues has improved from for to for and to for  mostly as a result of the impact of economies of scale 
we anticipate  however  that as we continue to invest in product development  sales and marketing and human resources in order to promote our services and capture the long term business opportunity offered by the internet in latin america  it is increasingly difficult to sustain growth in operating income margins  and at some point in the future we could experience decreasing operating income margins 
growth in net income we have generated growth in our net income as a consequence of the above mentioned trends 
in our net income was million 
for  our net income grew to million 
for  our net income grew to million 
however  as mentioned above  if any of these trends were to revert  our net income growth could be affected  or could even become negative on a year to year basis

the growth in net revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  resulted principally from a increase in the gross merchandise volume gmv transacted through our platform from to this gmv growth resulted from a increase in items sold between those years 
the increase in gmv and items sold was partially offset by a decrease in our take rate  which we define as net revenues as a percentage of gross merchandise volume  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in our take rate was primarily due to gmv growing faster than some of our revenue sources not tied to gmv  such as classifieds and upfront fees 
in addition  this gmv growth was positively impacted by us dollars figures mainly due to the fact that the parallel exchange rate used by our venezuelan subsidiaries in the first half of was bolivares fuertes per us dollar as compared to bolivares fuertes per us dollar for see critical accounting policies and estimates foreign currency translation for more detail

the increase in cost of net revenues was primarily attributable to an million increase in collection fees 
the increase in collection fees  which occurred primarily in brazil and argentina  was a result of the higher penetration of mercadopago  our payment solution  which has a higher collection fee cost  into our marketplace

in addition  sales taxes on our net revenues increased by million  or for the year ended december   compared to the same period of as a consequence of an increase in our net revenues 
moreover  during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year  expenditures related to our in house customer support operations increased by million  which increase was primarily driven by increases in compensation costs  recruitment  investments in improved service and initiatives to combat fraud  illegal items and fee evasion 
finally  for the year ended december   as compared to the previous year  bank transfer fees related to mercadopago  mainly in brazil  increased by million

the growth in product and technology development expenses in as compared to the same periods in was primarily attributable to an increase of million or a increase in compensation costs 
these additional compensation expenses were primarily related to the addition of engineers and  to a lesser extent  to increases in salaries  as we continue to invest in top quality talent to develop enhancements and new features across our platforms 
we believe product development is one of our key competitive advantages and intend to continue to invest in adding engineers to meet the increasingly sophisticated product expectations of our customer base 
product and technology development expenses also grew in as a consequence of an increase in maintenance expenses of million compared to  related to the use of cloud computing aws  it consulting fees  real time monitoring of our applications and the use of content distribution network cdn which is a system of computers containing copies of data placed at various nodes of a network and  an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to product and technology development of million  or compared to in addition  there was an increase of million  compared to the same period in  in other product and development expenses

the increase in sales and marketing expenses in when compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to a million or increase in other marketing expenses related to mercadopago chargebacks mainly in brazil and due to a one time negative impact related to certain voided or overdrawn checks that were processed by one of mercadopago s payments processors in brazil  which resulted in a loss of million in the second quarter of sales and marketing expenses also grew as a consequence of million increase in bad debt charges 
bad debt charges for the year ended december  represented of net revenues versus for the same period in in addition  sales and marketing expenses grew in  due to a million or increase in compensation costs driven by higher salaries to retain talent  and a million increase in trust and safety expenses due to the increased use of our buyer protection program developed to compensate buyers for unfulfilled transactions or other claims related to the quality of the purchased goods 
finally  our business off line expenses increased million year over year 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  was partially offset by a million decrease in on line expenses as a consequence of decreases in our affiliate program expenses

the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in other office expenses 
other income expenses  net september  september  september  september  year ended december  change from to in dollars in in millions  except percentages other income expenses as a percentage of net revenues percentages have been calculated using whole dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table 
the increase in other income expenses in was primarily a result of a a million decrease in financial expenses resulting from our determination to pre sell installment related financing receivables  which we commenced in the third quarter of  b a million increase in interest income and other financial charges related to higher interest income earned on our investments driven by a greater volume of investments and higher interest rates  particularly in brazil  and c a million increase in foreign currency gains attributable to the impact of the local currency appreciation on the cash balances held by our brazilian and mexican subsidiaries in us dollars during the year ended december  versus the same period of income and asset tax expense september  september  september  september  year ended december  change from to in dollars in in millions  except percentages income and asset tax as a percentage of net revenues percentages have been calculated using whole dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table 
the million increase in our income and asset tax expense from the year ended december  to the same period in was primarily a result of increases in income tax charges in all our segments  driven by higher taxable income year over year 
for the year ended december   our income and asset tax expense margin is higher as compared to the same period in the previous year  because in the year ended december  we recognized an income tax gain of million due to a reversal of tax valuation allowance related to our brazilian subsidiaries while during the year ended december  we reversed million related to a brazilian subsidiary acquired in the reversal of the tax valuation allowance was derived from our tax planning strategies implemented during the year which were designed to more efficiently use our accumulated tax loss carryforward credits from acquired companies 
in addition  for the year ended december  as compared to the previous year  our income and asset tax expense margin was negatively impacted by increases in income tax charge in brazil as a consequence of permanent tax differences period over period 
our blended tax rate is defined as income and asset tax expense as a percentage of income before income and asset tax 
our effective income tax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes net of charges related to dividend distribution from foreign subsidiaries which are offset with domestic foreign tax credits as a percentage of pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate excludes the effects of the deferred income tax  and the assets and complementary income tax 
the following table summarizes the changes in our blended and effective tax rate for the years ended december  and september  september  year ended december  blended tax rate effective tax rate our blended tax rate increased from the year ended december  to the year ended december  because a in we recognized an income tax gain of million due to a reversal of tax valuation allowance related to our brazilian subsidiaries while during the year ended december  we reversed million related to a brazilian subsidiary acquired in  b in we recorded an increase of million of our domestic deferred tax liabilities mainly as a consequence of temporary differences related to property and equipment  and to withholding taxes  c in our argentine taxable income has a lower share of the consolidated taxable income when compared to the same period in  which results in a higher consolidated tax rate as a consequence that argentina has a lower tax rate as we are beneficiary of a software development law compared to other locations and d in we recorded certain brazilian non deductible losses related to voided and or overdrawn checks processed by a mercadopago payments processor as described in our sales and marketing discussion 
our effective tax rate decreased from year ended december  to the same period in due to our brazilian business reorganization generated as part of our tax planning strategy  which permitted us to use tax loss carryforwards in that country and due to a decrease in the argentine effective tax rate as described below 
the following table sets forth our effective income tax rate related to our main locations for the years ended december  and september  september  year ended december  effective tax rate by country argentina brazil mexico venezuela the company s argentine subsidiary is a beneficiary of a software development law granting it a relief of of total income tax determined in each year 
mainly for that reason  our argentine operation s effective income tax rate for the years ended december  and are currently lower than the local statutory rate of 
if we had not been granted the argentine tax holiday  our argentine effective income tax rate would have been higher but  in that case  we would have pursued an alternative tax planning strategy 
the decrease in our argentine operation s effective income tax rate year over year is mainly related to variations in temporary tax differences 
for the years ended december  and  our brazilian effective income tax rate are lower than the local statutory rate of mainly because of the business reorganization generated as part of our tax planning strategy  which permitted us to use tax loss carryforwards in that country 
for the year ended december   our mexican effective income tax rate is lower than the local statutory rate of mainly because of variations in permanent tax differences 
for the year ended december   our mexican effective income tax rate is higher than the local statutory rate mainly as a consequence of temporary and permanent tax differences 
for the years ended december  and  our venezuelan effective income tax rates are higher than the local statutory rate mainly due to losses related to temporary differences generated by the re measurement of our foreign currency position computed for tax purposes that cannot be considered for us gaap purposes our venezuelan subsidiaries functional currency is the us dollar due to a highly inflationary environment 
our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the united states  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of  especially in the case of argentina  where we have significant operations with a low effective tax as a consequence of an argentine tax holiday 
a future change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions would impact the company s periodic effective tax rate 
we do not expect to have a significant impact in the domestic effective income tax rate related to dividend distributions from foreign subsidiaries since our strategy is to reinvest our cash surplus in our international operations  and to distribute dividends when they can be offset with available tax credits

the growth in net revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  resulted principally from a increase in the gross merchandise volume gmv transacted through our platform from to in addition  us dollars figures were positively impacted during this year mainly because of the appreciation of the brazilian reais  which was partially offset by a decrease in us dollar revenues provided by our venezuelan subsidiaries as a consequence of the venezuelan devaluation where we used to report our results at the previous official exchange rate of for the first nine months of and currently we are reporting it at see critical accounting policies and estimates foreign currency translation for more detail

our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as online commerce and emerging markets like latin america 
to address these risks and uncertainties  we must  among other things  maintain and increase the number of our confirmed registered users  items listed on our service and completed transactions  maintain and enhance our brand  implement and execute our business and marketing strategy successfully  continue to develop and upgrade our technology and information processing systems  continue to enhance the mercadolibre and mercadopago services to meet the needs of a changing market  provide superior customer service  respond to competitive developments  and attract  integrate  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
accordingly  we intend to invest heavily in marketing and promotion  site development  technology and operating infrastructure development and personnel 
we cannot  however  assure you that we will be successful in accomplishing all of these goals  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we have experienced significant revenue growth and significant growth in the number of our confirmed registered users and items listed by our users in recent periods  such growth rates are not sustainable and will decrease in the future 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our operating results have varied on an annual basis during our short operating history and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
the following list includes factors that may affect our operating results continued growth of online commerce and internet usage in latin america  our ability to expand our operations and adapt to rapidly changing technologies  governmental regulation in the countries where we operate  including exchange controls  litigation  legal liability and intellectual property rights enforcement  system interruptions or failures  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  the announcement or introduction of new sites  services and products by us or our competitors  and price competition  reliance on third party service providers  increasing consumer confidence in and acceptance of the internet and other online services for commerce and  in particular  the trading of products such as those listed on our web site  security breaches and consumer confidence in the security of transactions over the internet  consumer trends and popularity of certain categories of items  our ability to attract new customers  retain existing customers and increase revenues  seasonal fluctuations  and political  social and economic conditions in latin america  particularly venezuela  including foreign exchange rate fluctuations

liquidity and capital resources our main cash requirement historically has been working capital to fund our mercadopago financing operation in brazil 
we also require cash for capital expenditures relating to technology infrastructure  software applications and office space and also in the future require cash to pay dividends on shares of our common stock 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through contributions received from our stockholders during our first two years of operations  from funds raised during our initial public offering  and from cash generated from our operations 
we have funded mercadopago by discounting credit card receivables  with loans backed with credit card receivables and through cash advances derived from our business

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses  funds receivable from and payable to mercadopago users  and short term debt

in the event we change the way we manage our business  the working capital needs could be funded  as we did in the past  through a combination of the sale of credit card coupons to financial institutions  loans backed by credit card receivables and cash advances from our business

the investment in this trust was approximately of million and represented  square meters divided in five floors of an office building and parking spots under construction in the city of buenos aires  argentina 
in february  we moved our office headquarters 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  including the sale of credit card receivables and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  property and equipment expenditures and to pay or repay obligations going forward 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities for the purpose of facilitating contractually narrow or limited purposes

changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing materially from the estimates below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations 
these market risks arise mainly from the possibility that changes in interest rates and the us dollar exchange rate with local currencies  particularly the brazilian reais due to brazil s share of our revenues  may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities 
foreign currencies risk at december   we hold cash and cash equivalents in local currencies in our subsidiaries  and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations 
our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in local currency 
as a result  our subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency  except for our venezuelan subsidiaries which functional currency is the us dollar due to a highly inflationary accounting 
at december   the total cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies totaled million  short term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled million  and accounts receivable and funds receivable from customers in foreign currencies totaled million 
to manage exchange rate risk  our treasury policy is to transfer most cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into dollar denominated accounts in the united states 
at december   our dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million and our dollar denominated long term investments totaled million 
for the year ended december   we obtained foreign currency gains in the amount of million as the cash and investment balances of the subsidiaries held in us dollars appreciated in local current terms 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the year ended december   compared to year ended december  other income expenses for more detail 
in accordance with us gaap  we have transitioned our venezuelan operations to highly inflationary status as of january  and have been using the us dollar as the functional currency for these operations since then 
in accordance with us gaap  translation adjustments for prior periods were not removed from equity and the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets at december  become the accounting basis for those assets 
monetary assets and liabilities in bolivares fuertes were re measured to the us dollar at the closing parallel exchange rate and the results of the operations in bolivares fuertes were re measured to the us dollar at the average monthly parallel exchange rate 
during and previous years we were able to obtain us dollars using alternative mechanisms other than the cadivi 
these dollars  obtained at a higher exchange rate than the one offered by cadivi  and held in balance at us bank accounts of our venezuelan subsidiaries  were used for dividend distributions from our venezuelan subsidiary 
as a result  during  lack of cadivi approval did not restrict our ability to distribute the full amount of our retained earnings as dividends related to fiscal years million  and million 
in addition  during  our venezuelan subsidiary distributed dividends related to earnings for fiscal year  using existing cash balances held in the us bank accounts for a million 
as of december   the net assets of our venezuelan subsidiaries before intercompany eliminations amount to approximately of our consolidated net assets  and cash and investments of our venezuelan subsidiaries held in local currency in venezuela amount only to approximately of our consolidated cash and investments 
although  the current mechanisms available to obtain us dollars for dividends distributions to shareholders outside venezuela imply increased restrictions  the company does not expect that the current restrictions to purchase dollars have a significant adverse effect on its business plans with regard to the investment in venezuela 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses  and net income while the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars will have a negative impact in our statement of income 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  while the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars will have a positive impact in our statement of income

similarly  the table above shows a decrease in our net income when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars has a lesser impact than the decrease in net revenues  operating expenses  and other income expenses and income tax lines related to the translation effect 
in the past we have entered into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure but during  and we did not enter into any such agreement 
interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates 
these changes can have an impact on our interest expenses derived from selling our mercadopago receivables 
at december   mercadopago s funds receivable from customers totaled approximately million 
interest fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits  money market funds  investment grade corporate debt securities  and sovereign debt securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   the average duration of our available for sale securities  defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a basis point change in yield  is 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the fair market value of our available for sale securities as of december  could decrease increase by approximately million 
our short term and long term investments  which are classified on our balance sheet as current assets in the amount of million and as non current assets in the amount of million  respectively  can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date
