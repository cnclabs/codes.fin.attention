overview our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers 
the products offered on our consumer facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third party sellers  and we also manufacture and sell kindle devices 
generally  we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers as services sales 
we also offer other services such as aws  fulfillment  publishing  digital content subscriptions  miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements  such as online advertising  and co branded credit cards 
our financial focus is on long term  sustainable growth in free cash flow per share 
free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures 
increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs  offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives 
to increase sales of products and services  we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience  including lowering prices  improving availability  offering faster delivery and performance times  increasing selection  increasing product categories and service offerings  expanding product information  improving ease of use  improving reliability  and earning customer trust 
we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes  such as financings  acquisitions  and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests 
we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees 
in measuring shareholder dilution  we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding  without regard to estimated forfeitures 
total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were million and million at december  and free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets  including capitalized internal use software and website development  both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
see results of operations non gaap financial measures below 
working capital consists of accounts receivable  inventory  and accounts payable 

table of contents we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs 
our variable costs include product and content costs  payment processing and related transaction costs  picking  packaging  and preparing orders for shipment  transportation  customer service support  and a portion of our marketing costs 
our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure and aws  to build  enhance  and add features to our websites  our kindle devices  and digital offerings  and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers 
variable costs generally change directly with sales volume  while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs  geographic expansion  category expansion  and other factors 
to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers  we seek to increase our direct sourcing  increase discounts available to us from suppliers  and reduce defects in our processes 
to minimize growth in fixed costs  we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture 
because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash generating operating cycle on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due 
inventory turnover was   and for   and we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors  including our product mix  the mix of sales by us and by other sellers  our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability  our investment in new geographies and product lines  and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 
accounts payable days were   and for   and we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors  including the mix of product sales  the mix of sales by other sellers  the mix of suppliers  seasonality  and changes in payment terms over time  including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers 
we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists  software engineers  and merchandising employees 
we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content  including seller platforms  digital initiatives  and expansion of new and existing physical and digital product categories  as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience  improve our process efficiencies  and support aws 
we believe that advances in technology  specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power  the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home  and the advances of wireless connectivity  will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people s lives 
to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology  we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and devices 
we are also investing in aws  which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business 
our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends 
for example  if the us dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations  our consolidated net sales  and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant 
likewise  if the us dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations  our consolidated net sales  and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant 
we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term 
we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes 
in addition  the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates 
currency volatilities may continue  which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons 
the operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days 
inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends 
accounts payable days  calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales  multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter
