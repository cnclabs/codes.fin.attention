critical accounting estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are deemed to be necessary 
significant estimates made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include  but are not limited to  the following revenue recognition we generate our revenue primarily from premium and marketing services 
premium services include subscription fees paid by customers for access to particular investment information and rate services for the term of the subscription as well as syndication and licensing revenue 
subscriptions are generally charged to customers credit cards or are directly billed to corporate subscribers 
these are generally billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis 
we calculate net subscription revenue by deducting from gross revenue an estimate of potential refunds from cancelled subscriptions as well as chargebacks of disputed credit card charges 
net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription periods 
deferred revenue relates to subscription fees for which amounts have been collected but for which revenue has not been recognized because services have not yet been provided 
subscription revenue is subject to estimation and variability due to the fact that  in the normal course of business  subscribers may for various reasons contact us or their credit card companies to request a refund or other adjustment for a previously purchased subscription 
with respect to most of our annual subscription products  we offer the ability to receive a refund during the first days but none thereafter 
accordingly  we maintain a provision for estimated future revenue reductions resulting from expected refunds and chargebacks related to subscriptions for which revenue was recognized in a prior period 
the calculation of this provision is based upon historical trends and is reevaluated each quarter 
the provision was not material for any of the three years ended december  marketing services includes advertising revenue  which is derived from the sale of internet sponsorship arrangements and from the delivery of banner  tile  contextual  performance based and interactive advertisement and sponsorship placements in our advertising supported web sites  and is recognized as the advertising is displayed  provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
marketing services revenue also includes licensing fees paid by third parties to obtain the right to display the company s awards logos on their web sites and marketing materials in relation to certain award designations 
marketing services also include revenue associated with our former subsidiary  promotions 
com  which we sold in december see note in notes to consolidated financial statements acquisitions and divestitures 
promotions 
com generated revenue from web site design  promotion management and hosting services 
we typically entered into arrangements on a fixed fee basis for these services 
revenue generated from web site design services was recognized upon acceptance from the customer or on a straight line basis over the hosting period if we performed web site design services and hosted the software 
revenue from promotions management services was recognized straight line over the promotion period as the promotions were designed to only operate on promotions 
com s proprietary platform 
hosting services were recognized straight line over the hosting period 
revenue for contracts with multiple elements was allocated based on the element s fair value 
fair value was determined based on the prices charged when each element was sold separately 
elements qualified for separation when the services had value on a stand alone basis and fair value of the undelivered elements existed 
determining fair value and identifying separate elements required judgment  as generally fair value was not readily identifiable as we did not sell those elements individually at consistent pricing 
capitalized software and web site development costs we expense all costs incurred in the preliminary project stage for software developed for internal use and capitalize all external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
in addition  for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal use computer software projects  to the extent of the time spent directly on the project  we capitalize payroll and payroll related costs of such employees incurred once the development has reached the applications development stage 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs totaling approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
all costs incurred for upgrades  maintenance and enhancements that do not result in additional functionality are expensed 
we also account for our web site development costs under asc  which provides guidance on the accounting for the costs of development of company web sites  dividing the web site development costs into five stages the planning stage  during which the business and or project plan is formulated and functionalities  necessary hardware and technology are determined  the web site application and infrastructure development stage  which involves acquiring or developing hardware and software to operate the web site  the graphics development stage  during which the initial graphics and layout of each page are designed and coded  the content development stage  during which the information to be presented on the web site  which may be either textual or graphical in nature  is developed  and the operating stage  during which training  administration  maintenance and other costs to operate the existing web site are incurred 
the costs incurred in the web site application and infrastructure stage  the graphics development stage and the content development stage are capitalized  all other costs are expensed as incurred 
amortization of capitalized costs will not commence until the project is completed and placed into service 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized web site development costs totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
capitalized software and web site development costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software or web site 
during the year ended december   completed capitalized software and web site development projects were deemed to primarily have a two to three year useful life 
total amortization expense was approximately million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related acquisition costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
under the provisions of asc  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever indications of impairment exist 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exceed their implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge for this excess 
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment using a two step impairment test approach at the company level 
in the first step  the fair value of the company is compared to its book value  including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the fair value of the company is less than the book value  a second step is performed that compares the implied fair value of the company s goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to the book value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the fair value for the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the company and the net fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities 
if the fair value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as impairment 
we test for goodwill impairment at the enterprise level as the company is considered to operate as a single reporting unit 
the company utilizes two methodologies in performing its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test  a market approach  based upon actual stock prices of the company  and an income approach  namely a discounted cash flow method 
in the market approach  fair value is based on the company s actual common stock prices and the estimated fair value of the outstanding preferred shares to determine a fair value for the company 
the discounted cash flow method derives a value by determining the present value of the expected future cash flow to be generated by the company 
the results of the discounted cash flow method are used by the company as a method of confirming the reasonableness of the results obtained by the market approach 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets each year to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support their useful life 
there have been no changes in useful lives of intangible assets for each period presented 
determining the fair value of goodwill or an indefinite lived intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable 
however  as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  actual future results may differ from these estimates 
based upon annual impairment tests performed as of september  and  no impairment was indicated as the company s fair value  excluding a control premium  exceeded its book value by approximately and  respectively 
had a control premium been factored into the company s common stock fair value calculation  the excess of the fair value over its book value would have been greater 
as of december   we performed an interim impairment test of our goodwill due to certain potential impairment indicators  including a decline in the company s common stock price as well as the loss of certain key personnel 
the fair value of the company s goodwill was estimated using a market approach  based upon actual prices of the company s common stock excluding any control premium  and the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding preferred shares 
the fair value of the company s outstanding preferred shares requires significant judgments  including the estimation of the amount of time until a liquidation event occurs as well as an appropriate cash flow discount rate 
further  in assigning a fair value to the company s preferred stock  the company also considered that the preferred shareholders are entitled to receive a million liquidation preference upon liquidation or dissolution of the company or upon any change of control event as defined in the certificate of designation of series b preferred stock 
additionally  the holders of the preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends and to vote as a single class together with the holders of the common stock on an as converted basis and provided certain preferred share ownership levels are maintained  are entitled to representation on the company s board of directors and may unilaterally block issuance of certain classes of capital stock  the purchase or redemption of certain classes of capital stock  including common stock with certain exceptions and any increases in the per share amount of dividends payable to thje holders of the common stock 
as a result of this december  impairment test  the company concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
a dcecrease in the price of the company s common stock  or changes in the estimated value of the company s preferred shares  could materially affect the determination of the fair value and could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
additionally  the company believes that there were no events or changes in circumstances since september  that would lead us to believe there was any triggering event that would warrant an interim review for impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
in connection with the disposition of certain assets of thestreet ratings business those pertaining to banking and insurance ratings in may see note in notes to consolidated financial statements acquisitions and divestitures  we concluded that this event warranted an additional impairment test which resulted in no additional impairment as the company s fair value exceeded its book value by approximately 
in the first quarter of  we performed an interim impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets due to certain impairment indicators  including a continued decline in both advertising and subscription revenue resulting from the challenging economic environment and a reduction in our enterprise value 
as a result of this test  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  as follows the total company fair value was estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow model present value of future cash flows and our business enterprise value based upon the fair value of our outstanding common and preferred shares 
the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is the residual fair value after allocating the company s total fair value to its other assets and liabilities 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the review also revealed an additional impairment to our intangible assets related to certain customer relationships and noncompete agreements of approximately million 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements acquisitions and divestitures for further information related to the individual impairments recorded 
investments we believe that conservative investment policies are appropriate and we are not motivated to strive for aggressive spreads above treasury rates 
preservation of capital is of foremost concern  and by restricting investments to investment grade securities of relatively short maturities  we believe that our capital will be largely protected from severe economic conditions or drastic shifts in interest rates 
a high degree of diversification adds further controls over capital risk 
financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
we maintain all of our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash in six domestic financial institutions and we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents primarily consisted of money market funds and checking accounts 
marketable securities consist of liquid short term us treasuries  government agencies  certificates of deposit insured up to fdic limits  investment grade corporate and municipal bonds  corporate floating rate notes and two municipal auction rate securities ars issued by the district of columbia with a par value of approximately million 
as of december   the total fair value of these marketable securities was approximately million and the total cost basis was approximately million 
the maximum maturity for any investment is three years 
the ars pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  typically every days  and mature in the year the company accounts for its marketable securities in accordance with the provisions of asc the company classifies these securities as available for sale and the securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and excluded from net loss 
see note to consolidated financial statements comprehensive loss 
during  the company made an investment in debtfolio  inc  doing business as geezeo  an online financial management solutions provider for banks and credit unions 
the investment totaled approximately million for an ownership stake 
additionally  the company incurred approximately million of legal fees in connection with this investment 
during the first quarter of  the carrying value of the company s investment was written down to fair value based upon an estimate of the market value of the company s equity in light of debtfolio s efforts to raise capital at the time from third parties 
the impairment charge approximated million 
the company performed an additional impairment test as of december  and no additional impairment in value was noted 
during the three months ended june   the company determined it necessary to record a second impairment charge  writing the value of the investment to zero 
this was deemed necessary by management based upon their consideration of debtfolio  inc s continued negative cash flow from operations  current financial position and lack of current liquidity 
in october  debtfolio  inc repurchased the company s ownership stake in exchange for a subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million payable on october  as of december   we maintain a full valuation allowance against our subordinated promissory note due to the uncertainty of eventual collection 
see note to consolidated financial statements fair value measurements for additional information about the investment of the company s cash 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under asc  share based payment transactions asc 
this requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based upon estimated fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december    and was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense remaining to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the value of stock options granted to employees and directors is estimated using an option pricing model 
the value of each restricted stock unit under the company s performance incentive plan the plan is equal to the closing price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and includes compensation expense for all share based payment awards based upon the estimated grant date fair value 
we recognize compensation expense for share based payment awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the years ended december   and is based upon awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant which are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this determination is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
the amount of equity based compensation expense recorded each period is net of estimated forfeitures 
the weighted average fair value of employee stock options granted during the years ended december  and was and  respectively  using the black scholes model with the weighted average assumptions presented below 
because option pricing models require the use of subjective assumptions  changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the options 
the assumptions presented in the table below represent the weighted average value of the applicable assumption used to value stock options at their grant date 
in determining the volatility assumption  we used a historical analysis of the volatility of our share price for the preceding period equal to the expected option lives 
the expected option lives  which represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  were estimated based upon the simplified method for plain vanilla options 
the risk free interest rate assumption was based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption was based on the history and expectation of future dividend payouts 
the company s estimate of pre vesting forfeitures is primarily based on the company s historical experience and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures as the options vest 
for the years ended december  expected option lives years years expected volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends the impact of stock based compensation expense has been significant to reported results of operations and per share amounts 
because option pricing models require the use of subjective assumptions  changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the options 
for each increase in the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model  the resulting estimated impact to our total operating expense for the year ended december  would have caused an increase of approximately  for each increase in the expected volatility used in the black scholes option pricing model  the resulting estimated impact to our total operating expense for the year ended december  would have caused an increase of approximately  because options are expensed over three to five years from the date of grant  the foregoing estimated increases include potential expense for options granted during the prior years 
in calculating the amount of each variable that is included in the black scholes options pricing model ie  option exercise price  stock price  option term  risk free interest rate  annual dividend rate  and volatility  the weighted average of such variable for all grants issued in a given year was used 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for our income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december  and  we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our prior history of pre tax losses and uncertainty about the timing of and ability to generate taxable income in the future and our assessment that the realization of the deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under asc asc also prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits 
a liability is recognized for an unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions of asc as of december  and  no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be recorded 
deferred tax assets pertaining to windfall tax benefits on exercise of share awards and the corresponding credit to additional paid in capital are recorded if the related tax deduction reduces tax payable 
the company has elected the with and without approach regarding ordering of windfall tax benefits to determine whether the windfall tax benefit did reduce taxes payable in the current year 
under this approach  the windfall tax benefits would be recognized in additional paid in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after considering all other tax benefits presently available to us 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the commitments and contingencies section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimate of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
the company would record a material loss contingency in its consolidated financial statements if the loss is both probable of occurring and reasonably estimated 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may  in the future  adjust its associated liabilities 
legal contingencies as previously disclosed  in  the company  certain of its current or former officers and directors and certain underwriters were named in a securities class action related to the company s initial public offering ipo 
similar suits were filed against approximately other issuers and their underwriters  all of which are included in a single coordinated proceeding in the district court the ipo litigations 
the complaints allege that the prospectus and the registration statement for the ipo failed to disclose that the underwriters allegedly solicited and received excessive commissions from investors and that some investors in the ipo allegedly agreed with the underwriters to buy additional shares in the aftermarket in order to inflate the price of the company s stock 
the complaints seek unspecified damages  attorney and expert fees  and other unspecified litigation costs 
in  the district court granted the company s motion to dismiss the claims against it under rule b but motions to dismiss the claims under section of the securities act of were denied as to virtually all of the defendants in the consolidated cases  including the company 
in addition  some of the individual defendants in the ipo litigations signed a tolling agreement and were dismissed from the action without prejudice on october  in  a proposed collective partial settlement of this litigation was structured between the plaintiffs  the issuer defendants in the consolidated actions  the issuer officers and directors named as defendants  and the issuers insurance companies 
the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement in but in the settlement was terminated  in light of a ruling by the appellate court in related litigation in that reversed the trial court s certification of classes in that related litigation 
in  another settlement was entered into and approved by the trial court 
under the settlement  the company s obligation would be paid by the issuers insurance companies 
the settlement was appealed  in may  the second circuit court of appeals dismissed one appeal and remanded another appeal to the district court to determine whether the appellant has standing  in august  the district court determined that the applicable appellant did not have standing  which decision was appealed 
in january  the appeal was dismissed and the settlement is to be effected
