item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations later in this report 
we are subject to certain risks with respect to our dividend policy we may not pay dividends on our common stock 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds available for such payments under applicable law and regulatory guidance 
furthermore  regulatory agencies may impose further restrictions on the payment of dividends in the future 
in addition  although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so 
any reduction of  or the elimination of  our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we rely on the dividends we receive from our subsidiaries 
the parent company ie  the company on an unconsolidated basis is a separate and distinct legal entity from the banks  and a substantial portion of the revenues the parent company receives consists of dividends from the banks 
these dividends are the primary funding source for the dividends we pay on our common stock and the interest and principal payments on our debt 
various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company 
in addition  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary may be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
if the banks are unable to pay dividends to the company  we may not be able to service our debt  pay our obligations  or pay dividends on our common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from the banks could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  our financial condition  and our results of operations  as well as our ability to maintain or increase the current level of cash dividends paid to our shareholders 
if we defer payments on our trust preferred capital debt securities or are in default under the related indentures  we will be prohibited from paying dividends or distributions on our common stock 
the terms of our outstanding trust preferred capital debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock  including our common stock  or purchasing  acquiring  or making a liquidation payment on such stock  under the following circumstances a if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture  b if we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related trust preferred securities  or c if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced  or a deferral period is continuing 
in addition  without notice to  or consent from  the holders of our common stock  we may issue additional series of trust preferred capital debt securities with similar terms  or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

table of contents the extensive laws  regulations  and regulatory enforcements to which we are subject pose certain risks we are subject to certain risks with respect to our ability to comply with certain laws and regulations 
we are subject to regulation  supervision  and examination by the following entities the nydfs  the chartering authority for both the community bank and the commercial bank  the fdic  as the insurer of the banks deposits  the federal reserve bank of new york  in accordance with objectives and standards of the us federal reserve system  and the cfpb  which was established in under dodd frank and given broad authority to regulate financial service providers and financial products 
such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which a bank holding company and its banking subsidiaries may engage  and is intended primarily for the protection of the dif  the banking system in general  and customers  and not for the benefit of a company s stockholders 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company  the imposition of significant fines  the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications  the classification of assets by a bank  and the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses  among other matters 
any failure to comply with  or any change in  such regulation and supervision  or change in regulation or enforcement by such authorities  whether in the form of policy  regulations  legislation  rules  orders  enforcement actions  or decisions  could have a material impact on the company  our subsidiary banks and other affiliates  and our operations 
our operations are also subject to extensive legislation enacted  and regulation implemented  by other federal  state  and local governmental authorities  and to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations 
while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal  state  and local laws  rules  and regulations  including those pertaining to banking  lending  and taxation  among other matters  we may be subject to future changes in such laws  rules  and regulations that could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the broader regulatory regime established under the dodd frank act may adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
the enactment of the dodd frank act in july significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry 
in addition to creating the cfpb  the act established new standards relating to regulatory oversight of systemically important financial institutions  derivatives transactions  asset backed securitization  and mortgage underwriting  and limited the revenues banks can derive from debit card interchange fees 
extensive regulatory guidance is needed to implement and clarify many of the provisions of the dodd frank act and  although certain us agencies have begun to initiate the required administrative processes  it is still too early in those processes to fully assess the impact of this legislation on our business  the rest of the banking industry  and the broader financial services industry 
additional legislative and regulatory proposals may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition to the numerous regulatory actions expected in connection with the implementation of the dodd frank act  additional legislative and regulatory proposals are being considered by the us congress and various federal regulators that also may significantly impact the financial services industry and our business 
for example  the federal reserve bank has proposed guidance on incentive compensation at the banking organizations it regulates  and the us department of the treasury and the federal banking regulators have issued statements calling for higher capital and liquidity requirements for banks 
complying with any new legislative or regulatory requirements  and any programs established thereunder by federal and state governments to address the continuing economic weakness  could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  our ability to fill positions with the most qualified candidates available  and our ability to maintain our dividend 
furthermore  the current administration has announced plans to dramatically transform the role of government in the us housing market  including by winding down fannie mae and freddie mac  and by reducing other government support to such markets 
congressional leaders have voiced similar plans for future legislation 
it is too early to determine the nature and scope of any legislation that may develop along these lines  or what roles fannie mae and freddie mac or the private sector will play in future housing markets 
however  it is possible that legislation will be proposed over the near term that would result in the nature of gse guarantees being considerably limited relative to historical measurements  which could have broad adverse implications for the market and significant implications for our business 

table of contents our enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks we are subject to or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks 
as a financial institution  we are subject to a number of risks  including credit  interest rate  liquidity  market  operational  legal compliance  loss sharing compliance  reputational  and strategic 
our enterprise risk management framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject  as well as any losses stemming from such risks 
although we seek to identify  measure  monitor  report  and control our exposure to such risks  and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process  those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated 
for example  recent economic conditions  heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry  and increases in the overall complexity of our operations  among other developments  have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated  highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques 
as a result  the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to certain risks in connection with our strategy of growing through mergers and acquisitions 
mergers and acquisitions have contributed significantly to our growth in the past  and remain a component of our business model 
accordingly  it is possible that we could acquire other financial institutions  financial service providers  or branches of banks in the future  either through negotiated transactions or fdic assisted acquisitions 
however  our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions depends on various factors  including our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities  our ability to finance and complete negotiated transactions on acceptable terms and at acceptable prices  our ability to bid competitively for fdic assisted transactions  our ability to receive the necessary regulatory approvals  and when  required  our ability to receive the necessary shareholder approvals 
our inability to engage in an acquisition or merger for any of these reasons could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as acquisitions have been a significant source of deposits  the inability to complete a business combination could require that we increase the interest rates we pay on deposits in order to attract such funding through our current branch network  or that we increase our use of wholesale funds 
increasing our cost of funds could adversely impact our net interest income  and therefore our results of operations 
furthermore  the funding we obtain in acquisitions is generally used to fund our loan production or to reduce our higher funding costs 
the absence of an acquisition could therefore impact our ability to meet our loan demand 
furthermore  mergers and acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including our ability to integrate the branches and operations we acquire  and the internal controls and regulatory functions into our current operations  our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired branches and to successfully retain and manage the loans we acquire  our ability to attract new deposits  and to generate new interest earning assets  in geographic areas we have not previously served  our success in deploying any cash received in a transaction into assets bearing sufficiently high yields without incurring unacceptable credit or interest rate risk  our ability to control the incremental non interest expense from the acquired branches in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio  our ability to retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff the acquired branches and conduct any acquired operations  our ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non interest income  including fee income  from the acquired branches  the diversion of management s attention from existing operations  our ability to address an increase in working capital requirements  and limitations on our ability to successfully reposition the post merger balance sheet  when deemed appropriate 

table of contents additionally  no assurance can be given that the operation of acquired branches would not adversely affect our existing profitability  that we would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business  that we would be able to compete effectively in the market areas served by acquired branches  or that we would be able to manage any growth resulting from a transaction effectively 
in particular  our ability to compete effectively in new markets is dependent on our ability to understand those markets and their competitive dynamics  and our ability to retain certain key employees from the acquired institution who know those markets better than we do 
any of these factors  among others  could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions we undertake and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
furthermore  the acquisition of assets and liabilities of financial institutions in fdic sponsored or assisted transactions involves risks similar to those faced when acquiring existing financial institutions  even though the fdic might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks  eg  by entering into loss sharing arrangements 
however  because such acquisitions are structured in a manner that does not allow the time normally associated with evaluating and preparing for the integration of an acquired institution  we face the additional risk that the anticipated benefits of such an acquisition may not be realized fully or at all  or within the time period expected 
economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
financial institutions continue to be affected by economic weakness in the form of high unemployment and soft real estate values 
although we have taken  and continue to take  steps to reduce our exposure to the risks that stem from such conditions  we nonetheless could be impacted by them to the degree that they affect the loans we originate  the securities we invest in  and our portfolios of covered and non covered loans 
declines in the value of our investment securities could result in our recording losses on the other than temporary impairment of securities  which would reduce our earnings and  therefore  our capital 
declines in real estate values and home sales  and an increase in the financial stress on borrowers stemming from high unemployment  among other economic conditions  could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could adversely impact the repayment of the loans we have made 
further deterioration in economic conditions also could subject us and our industry to increased regulatory scrutiny and could result in an increase in loan delinquencies  an increase in problem assets and foreclosures  and a decline in the value of the collateral for our loans  which could reduce our customers borrowing power 
deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our loan loss allowances  this  in turn  could necessitate an increase in our provisions for loan losses  which would reduce our earnings and capital 
additionally  continued economic weakness could reduce the demand for our products and services  which would adversely impact our liquidity and the revenues we produce 
we face significant competition for loans and deposits 
we face significant competition for loans and deposits from other banks and financial institutions  both within and beyond our local markets 
we compete with commercial banks  savings banks  credit unions  and investment banks for deposits  and with the same financial institutions and others including mortgage brokers  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage houses for loans 
we also compete with companies that solicit loans and deposits over the internet 
many of our competitors including money center  national  and superregional banks have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we do  and may offer certain products and services that we cannot 
because our profitability stems from our ability to attract deposits and originate loans  our continued ability to compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success 
our success as a competitor depends on a number of factors  including our ability to develop  maintain  and build long term relationships with our customers by providing them with convenience  in the form of multiple branch locations and extended hours of service  access  in the form of alternative delivery channels  such as online banking  banking by phone  and atms  a broad and diverse selection of products and services  interest rates and service fees that compare favorably with those of our competitors  and skilled and knowledgeable personnel to assist our customers with their financial needs 
external factors that may impact our ability to compete include changes in local economic conditions and real estate values  changes in interest rates  and the consolidation of banks and thrifts within our marketplace 
in addition  our mortgage banking operation originates one to four family loans for sale throughout the nation  and therefore competes nationally with other major banks and mortgage brokers for this business 

table of contents the level of revenues we produce is unpredictable 
the net interest income we produce includes prepayment penalty income  which depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay 
such activity is largely dependent on current market conditions  the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates  and the contractual repricing and maturity dates of our multi family and cre loans 
as a result  the level of prepayment penalty income we record will vary from period to period  and is difficult to predict 
similarly  the revenues we generate in the form of net interest income are complemented by the non interest income we produce 
our primary source of non interest income is the mortgage banking income we generate through our origination of one to four family loans for sale  which includes income from originations and servicing income 
the level of mortgage banking income we produce depends on various factors  including the level of residential market interest rates  the level of refinancing activity and new home sales  conditions in the us housing market  and competition with other banks and mortgage banking firms 
as a result  the mortgage banking income we produce is unpredictable in nature and also may vary from one period to the next 
we are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology our security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack 
communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business  as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships  our general ledger  our deposits  and our loans 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage  and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  the security of our computer systems  software  and networks may be vulnerable to breaches  unauthorized access  misuse  computer viruses  or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact 
in addition  breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or the confidential or other information of our customers  clients  or counterparties 
if one or more of such events were to occur  the confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized  or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers  clients  or counterparties 
this could cause us significant reputational damage or result in our experiencing significant losses 
furthermore  we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks 
also  we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance we maintain 
in addition  we routinely transmit and receive personal  confidential  and proprietary information by e mail and other electronic means 
we have discussed and worked with our customers  clients  and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities  but we do not have  and may be unable to put in place  secure capabilities with all of these constituents  and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information 
any interception  misuse  or mishandling of personal  confidential  or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer  client  or counterparty could result in legal liability  regulatory action  and reputational harm  and could have a significant adverse effect on our competitive position  financial condition  and results of operations 
our security measures may not protect us from systems failures or interruptions 
while we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions  there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do 
in addition  we outsource certain aspects of our data processing to certain third party providers 
if our third party providers encounter difficulties  or if we have difficulty in communicating with them  our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected  and our business operations could be adversely impacted 
threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel 
the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business  could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to keep pace with changes in bank technology 
financial products and services have become increasingly technology driven 
to some degree  our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively  and in a cost efficient manner  is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available 
many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology driven products and services 
the ability to keep pace with technological change is important  and the failure to do so on our part could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations 
our goodwill may become impaired 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently  if necessary 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measuring impairment  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
if we were to determine that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value  we would be required to write down the value of the goodwill on our balance sheet 
this  in turn  would result in a charge against earnings and  thus  a reduction in our stockholders equity 
the results of our most recent internal stress test might not accurately predict the impact of a decline in economic conditions on our financial condition 
we regularly perform an internal analysis of our capital position 
in doing so  we apply many of the same methodologies that the us treasury applies in estimating our loan losses  the resources available to us to absorb such losses  and any necessary additions to capital that could be required  in periods of economic stress 
the assumptions we utilize for our stress tests may not be the same as those used by our regulators or others  and may include less severe loss assumptions than those under more adverse stress test scenarios 
accordingly  results of our stress tests may not be comparable to the results of stress tests performed by others including those performed by our regulators  and our estimates for loan losses or other losses based on such testing may be lower than those derived by using other assumptions 
the results of our internal stress tests involve many assumptions about the economy  future loan losses  and default rates  and may not accurately reflect the impact on our financial condition if the economy does not improve or deteriorates 
deterioration of the economy could result in our recording significantly higher credit losses than those predicted by our internal stress tests  and could have a corresponding impact on our financial condition and capital 
we are subject to risks associated with taxation 
the amount of income taxes we are required to pay on our earnings is based on federal and state legislation and regulations 
we provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements  based on our results of operations  business activity  legal structure  interpretation of tax statutes  assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit  and application of financial accounting standards 
we may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain 
our net income and earnings per share may be reduced if a federal  state  or local authority assesses additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate either due to a change in tax law  a change in regulatory or judicial guidance  or an audit assessment that denies previously recognized tax benefits 
we may be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums  special assessments  or taxes that could adversely affect our earnings 
market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits in recent years 
as a result  we may be required to pay significantly higher premiums or additional special assessments or taxes that could adversely affect our earnings 
we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the higher levels imposed in these increases and any future increases or required prepayments in fdic insurance premiums or taxes may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 
to a large degree  our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel whose expertise  knowledge of our markets  and years of industry experience would make them difficult to replace 
competition for skilled leaders in our industry can be intense  and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we would like to have working for us 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business  given the specialized knowledge of such personnel and the difficulty of finding qualified replacements on a timely basis 
to attract and retain personnel with the skills and knowledge to support our business  we offer a variety of benefits that may reduce our earnings 

table of contents damage to our reputation could significantly harm the businesses we engage in  as well as our competitive position and prospects for growth 
our ability to attract and retain investors  customers  clients  and employees could be adversely affected if our reputation were damaged 
significant harm to our reputation could arise from many sources  including employee misconduct  litigation or regulatory outcomes  failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality  compliance failures  unethical behavior  unintended disclosure of confidential information  and the activities of our clients  customers  and or counterparties 
actions by the financial services industry in general  or by certain entities or individuals within it  also could have a significantly adverse impact on our reputation 
our actual or perceived failure to address various issues also could give rise to reputational risk that could significantly harm us and our business prospects  including failure to properly address operational risks 
these issues include legal and regulatory requirements  privacy  properly maintaining customer and associated personal information  record keeping  protecting against money laundering  sales and trading practices  ethical issues  and the proper identification of the legal  reputational  credit  liquidity  and market risks inherent in our products and services 
we are subject to certain risks with respect to the value of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects 
among other factors  these risks may be affected by operating results that vary from the expectations of our management or of securities analysts and investors  developments in our business or in the financial services sector generally  regulatory or legislative changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations  operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us  changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or rating agencies  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions  dispositions  financings  and other material events by us or our competitors  changes or volatility in global financial markets and economies  general market conditions  interest or foreign exchange rates  stock  commodity  credit  or asset valuations  and significant fluctuations in the capital markets 
although the economy showed some signs of improvement in  renewed economic or market turmoil could occur in the near or long term  which could negatively affect our business  our financial condition  and our results of operations  as well as volatility in the price and trading volume of our common stock
