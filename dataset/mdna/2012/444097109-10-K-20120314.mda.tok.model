item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
employees at december   we had approximately employees 
at december   two of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements 
both of these employees are on site employees at the sunset bronson property 
we believe that relations with our employees are good 
principal executive offices our principal executive offices are located at wilshire blvd  suite  los angeles  california telephone 
we believe that our current facilities are adequate for our present operations 
regulation general our properties are subject to various covenants  laws  ordinances and regulations  including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements 
we believe that each of the properties in our portfolio has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business 
americans with disabilities act our properties must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
we have developed and undertaken continuous capital improvement programs at certain properties in the past 
these capital improvement programs will continue to progress and certain ada upgrades will continue to be integrated into the planned improvements  specifically at the media and entertainment properties where we are able to utilize in house construction crews to minimize costs for required ada related improvements 
however  some of our properties may currently be in noncompliance with the ada 
such noncompliance could result in the incurrence of additional costs to attain compliance  the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is 
table of contents an ongoing one  and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect 
environmental matters under various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  as a current or former owner or operator of real property  we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances  waste or petroleum products at  on  in  under  or migrating from such property  including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for natural resources 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such contamination  and the liability may be joint and several 
these liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation  removal  fines  or other costs could exceed the value of the property and or our aggregate assets 
in addition  the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third party liability for costs of remediation and or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell  lease or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral 
in addition  environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination 
moreover  if contamination is discovered on our properties  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated  and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures 
some of our properties contain  have contained  or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
similarly  some of our properties were used in the past for commercial or industrial purposes  or are currently used for commercial purposes  that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances  or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes 
as a result  some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from the releases of such hazardous substances or petroleum products 
where we have deemed appropriate  we have taken steps to address identified contamination or mitigate risks associated with such contamination  however  we are unable to ensure that further actions will not be necessary 
as a result of the foregoing  we could potentially incur material liabilities 
independent environmental consultants have conducted phase i environmental site assessments at all of the properties in our portfolio using the american society for testing and materials astm practice e a phase i environmental site assessment is a report prepared for real estate holdings that identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities 
site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties 
these assessments do not generally include soil samplings  subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey 
none of the recent site assessments identified any known past or present contamination that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or operations 
however  the assessments are limited in scope and may have failed to identify all environmental conditions or concerns 
a prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments 
material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future  and future laws  ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos and lead containing building materials  or acbm  and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third party liability eg  liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos 
such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing acbm and employers in such buildings properly manage and maintain the asbestos and lead  adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with asbestos or lead  and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos or lead would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
some of our properties contain acbm and we could be liable for such damages  fines or penalties 
in addition  the properties in our portfolio also are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental and health and safety requirements  such as state and local fire requirements 
moreover  some of our tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties  which are subject to regulation 
such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities 
environmental liabilities could affect a tenant s ability to make rental payments to us 
in addition  changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance 
we sometimes require our tenants to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities 
but in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy such obligations  we may be required to satisfy such obligations 
in addition  we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims regardless of whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or waste and irrespective of tenant lease provisions 
the costs associated with such 
table of contents liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation  chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources  and other biological contaminants such as pollen  viruses and bacteria 
indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation 
in addition  the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 
we are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties

risk factors forward looking statements certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us or our representatives in this annual report on form k  other filings or reports filed with the sec  press releases  conferences  or otherwise  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of set forth in section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act 
in particular  statements relating to our liquidity and capital resources  portfolio performance and results of operations contain forward looking statements 
furthermore  all of the statements regarding future financial performance including anticipated funds from operations ffo  market conditions and demographics are forward looking statements 
we are including this cautionary statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of for any such forward looking statements 
we caution investors that any forward looking statements presented in this annual report on form k  or that management may make orally or in writing from time to time  are based on management s beliefs and assumptions made by  and information currently available to  management 
when used  the words anticipate  believe  expect  intend  may  might  plan  estimate  project  should  will  result and similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions and may be affected by known and unknown risks  trends  uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
accordingly  investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements  which were based on results and trends at the time they were made  to anticipate future results or trends 
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results  performance  liquidity or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include  among others  the following adverse economic or real estate developments in our markets  general economic conditions  
table of contents defaults on  early terminations of or non renewal of leases by tenants  fluctuations in interest rates and increased operating costs  our failure to obtain necessary outside financing  our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness  lack or insufficient amounts of insurance  decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates  difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions  our failure to successfully operate acquired properties and operations  our failure to maintain our status as a reit  environmental uncertainties and risks related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  financial market fluctuations  changes in real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates  and other factors affecting the real estate industry generally 
set forth below are some but not all of the factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
risks related to our properties and our business all of our properties are located in california  and we therefore are dependent on the california economy and are susceptible to adverse local regulations and natural disasters affecting california 
all of our properties are located in california  which exposes us to greater economic risks than if we owned a more geographically dispersed portfolio 
further  our properties are concentrated in certain submarkets  exposing us to risks associated with those specific areas 
we are susceptible to adverse developments in the california economic and regulatory environment such as business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  relocations of businesses  increases in real estate and other taxes  costs of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation  as well as to natural disasters that occur in our markets such as earthquakes and other events 
for example  prior to the acquisition of our city plaza property located in orange county  california  the area was impacted significantly by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market  which had a material adverse effect on property values  vacancy rates and rents in the area 
had we owned city plaza at that time  we would have been exposed to those adverse effects  which were more pronounced in orange county than in other parts of the state and country 
we anticipate that we will be exposed to similar risks related to the geographic concentration of our properties in the future 
in addition  the state of california continues to suffer from severe budgetary constraints and is regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many other states  all of which may reduce demand for office space in california 
any adverse developments in the economy or real estate market in california  or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the california regulatory or business environment  could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
we cannot assure you of the growth of the california economy or of our future growth rate 
we derive a significant portion of our rental revenue from tenants in the media  entertainment  and technology industries  which makes us particularly susceptible to demand for rental space in those industries 
the sunset gower  sunset bronson  technicolor building  washington  howard  and second street 
table of contents properties in our portfolio are leased to primarily media  entertainment  or technology tenants and a significant portion of our rental revenue is derived from tenants in the media  entertainment  and technology industries 
consequently  we are susceptible to adverse developments affecting the demand by media  entertainment  and technology tenants for office  production and support space in southern and northern california and  more particularly  in hollywood and the south of market submarket of san francisco  such as writer  director and actor strikes  industry slowdowns and the relocation of media  entertainment  and technology businesses to other locations 
although our technicolor building property and the washington property are principally occupied and suitable for general office purposes  portions of such properties may require modifications prior to or at the commencement of a lease term if it were to be released to more traditional office users 
although our sunset gower and sunset bronson properties contain both sound stages and space suitable for office use  they have historically served the media and entertainment industry and will continue to depend on that sector for future tenancy 
in addition  our media and entertainment properties tend to be subject to short term leases of less than one year 
as a result  were there to be adverse developments affecting the demand by media and entertainment tenants for office  production and support space  it could affect the occupancy of our media and entertainment properties more quickly than if we had longer term leases 
any adverse development in the media  entertainment  and technology industries could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
we may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of properties that meet our criteria  which may impede our growth 
our business strategy includes the acquisition of underperforming office properties 
these activities require us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategies 
we continue to evaluate the market of available properties and may attempt to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist 
however  we may be unable to acquire any of the properties that we may identify as potential acquisition opportunities in the future 
our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms  or at all  may be exposed to the following significant risks potential inability to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital  including publicly traded reits  private equity investors and institutional investment funds  which may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage  including risks with respect to the geographic proximity of investments and the payment of higher acquisition prices  we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions  including ones that we are subsequently unable to complete  even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties  these agreements are typically subject to customary conditions to closing  including the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations  and we may be unable to finance the acquisition on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to finance property acquisitions or acquire properties on favorable terms  or at all  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities could be adversely affected 
in addition  failure to identify or complete acquisitions of suitable properties could slow our growth 
our future acquisitions may not yield the returns we expect 
our future acquisitions and our ability to successfully operate the properties we acquire in such acquisitions may be exposed to the following significant risks even if we are able to acquire a desired property  competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price  we may acquire properties that are not accretive to our results upon acquisition  and we may not successfully manage and lease those properties to meet our expectations  our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments  we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties  
table of contents we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into our existing operations  and as a result our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates  and we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
if we cannot operate acquired properties to meet our financial expectations  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities could be adversely affected 
we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions  which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets 
in the future we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership  which may result in stockholder dilution 
this acquisition structure may have the effect of  among other things  reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties  and may require that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases 
these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time  or on terms  that would be favorable absent such restrictions 
our growth depends on external sources of capital that are outside of our control and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we are required to meet various requirements under the internal revenue code of  as amended  or code  including that we distribute annually at least of our net taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain 
in addition  we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than of our net taxable income  including any net capital gains 
because of these distribution requirements  we may not be able to fund future capital needs  including any necessary acquisition financing  from operating cash flow 
consequently  we intend to rely on third party sources to fund our capital needs 
we may not be able to obtain the financing on favorable terms or at all 
any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage and likelihood of default 
our access to third party sources of capital depends  in part  on general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential  our current debt levels  our current and expected future earnings  our cash flow and cash distributions  and the market price per share of our common stock 
recently  the credit markets have been subject to significant disruptions 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist  meet the capital and operating needs of our existing properties  satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 

table of contents failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  cash available for distribution  including cash available for payment of dividends on and the per share trading price of our securities 
if interest rates increase  then so will the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt  which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
further  rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures 
we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that involve risk  such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements  and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes 
failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  cash available for distribution  including cash available for payment of dividends on and the per share trading price of our securities 
in addition  while such agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us  they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform  we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements  the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  derivative and hedging 
mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure  which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt 
incurring mortgage and other secured debt obligations increases our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default 
any foreclosure on a mortgaged property or group of properties could adversely affect the overall value of our portfolio of properties 
for tax purposes  a foreclosure of any of our properties that is subject to a nonrecourse mortgage loan would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure  but would not receive any cash proceeds 
our secured revolving credit facility restricts our ability to engage in some business activities 
our secured revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that  among other things restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  restrict our ability to make certain investments  restrict our ability to merge with another company  restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders  and require us to maintain financial coverage ratios 
these limitations restrict our ability to engage in some business activities  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  cash available for distributions to our stockholders  and per share trading price of our securities 
in addition  failure to meet any of these covenants  including the financial coverage ratios  could cause an event of default under and or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
furthermore  our secured revolving credit facility contains specific cross default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness  giving the lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances 
adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities 
our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the us economy or real estate industry as a whole  including dislocations in the credit markets 
these conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities as a result of the following potential consequences  among others significant job losses in the financial and professional services industries may occur  which may decrease 
table of contents demand for our office space  causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted  our ability to obtain financing on terms and conditions that we find acceptable  or at all  may be limited  which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt  reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense  reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans  and one or more lenders under our secured revolving credit facility could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  the economic downturn has adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the businesses of many of our tenants 
as a result  we may see increases in bankruptcies of our tenants and increased defaults by tenants  and we may experience higher vacancy rates and delays in re leasing vacant space  which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
we have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or implement our business strategies as described in this annual report on form k 
we commenced operations only upon completion of our initial public offering on june  our office portfolio consists of properties located throughout california  containing a total of approximately million net rentable square feet 
our arizona  brannan  second street and hollywood properties have only been under our management since they were acquired on july   august   september  and november   respectively 
these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could affect such properties valuation or revenue potential 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the operating performance of the properties will not decline under our management 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our business successfully or implement our business strategies 
we have a limited operating history as a reit and as a publicly traded company and may not be able to successfully operate as a reit or a publicly traded company 
we have a limited operating history as a reit and as a publicly traded company 
we cannot assure you that the past experience of our senior management team will be sufficient to successfully operate our company as a reit or a publicly traded company  including the requirements to timely meet disclosure requirements of the sec and comply with the sarbanes oxley act of since our initial public offering  we have been subject to various requirements related to reits and publicly traded companies  including requirements to develop and implement control systems and procedures in order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a reit and satisfy our periodic and current reporting requirements under applicable sec regulations and comply with new york stock exchange  or nyse  listing standards 
compliance with these requirements could place a significant strain on our management systems  infrastructure and other resources 
failure to operate successfully as a public company or qualify and maintain our qualification as a reit would have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
we face significant competition  which may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties 
we compete with numerous developers  owners and operators of office properties  many of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located 
if our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates  or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants  we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge or to offer more substantial rent abatements  tenant improvements  early termination rights or below market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our tenants leases expire 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities could be adversely affected 
we depend on significant tenants  and many of our properties are single tenant properties or are currently occupied by single tenants 

table of contents as of december   the ten largest tenants in our office portfolio represented approximately of the total annualized base rent generated by our office properties 
the inability of a significant tenant to pay rent or the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties 
if a tenant becomes bankrupt or insolvent  federal law may prohibit us from evicting such tenant based solely upon such bankruptcy or insolvency 
in addition  a bankrupt or insolvent tenant may be authorized to reject and terminate its lease with us 
any claim against such tenant for unpaid  future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease 
as of december   our largest tenant was bank of america  which accounted for of our annualized base rent and therefore represented a significant credit concentration 
if bank of america were to experience a downturn in its business or a weakening of its financial condition resulting in its failure to make timely rental payments or causing it to default under its lease  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
any such event described above could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
furthermore  saatchi saatchi leases of the del amo office property under the terms of an office lease that permits saatchi saatchi to terminate the lease as to all of the leased premises prior to the stated lease expiration on december  and december   in each case upon nine months prior notice and in exchange for payment of an early termination fee estimated to be approximately million for and approximately million for as of december   the saatchi saatchi lease comprised approximately of our annualized office base rent 
to the extent that saatchi saatchi exercises its early termination right  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow will be adversely affected  and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to generate an equivalent amount of net rental revenue by leasing the vacated space to new third party tenants 
our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities could be adversely affected if any of our significant tenants were to become unable to pay their rent or become bankrupt or insolvent 
we may be unable to renew leases  lease vacant space or re let space as leases expire 
as of december   approximately of the square footage of the office properties in our portfolio was available taking into account uncommenced leases signed as of december   and an additional approximately of the square footage of the office properties in our portfolio is scheduled to expire in furthermore  substantially all of the square footage of the media and entertainment properties in our portfolio other than the ktla lease of the ktla facility at sunset bronson will expire in and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements  tenant improvements  early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants 
if the rental rates for our properties decrease  our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities could be adversely affected 
we may be required to make rent or other concessions and or significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants  causing our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities to be adversely affected 
to the extent adverse economic conditions continue in the real estate market and demand for office space remains low  we expect that  upon expiration of leases at our properties  we will be required to make rent or other concessions to tenants  accommodate requests for renovations  build to suit remodeling and other improvements or provide additional services to our tenants 
as a result  we may have to make significant capital or other expenditures in order to retain tenants whose leases expire and to attract new tenants in sufficient numbers 
additionally  we may need to raise capital to make such expenditures 
if we are unable to do so or capital is otherwise unavailable  we may be unable to make the required expenditures 
this could result in non renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases  which could cause an adverse effect to our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
the actual rents we receive for the properties in our portfolio may be less than our asking rents  and we may experience lease roll down from time to time 
as a result of various factors  including competitive pricing pressure in our submarkets  adverse conditions in the northern or southern california real estate markets  a general economic downturn and the desirability of our properties compared to other properties in our submarkets  we may be unable to realize the asking rents across the properties in our portfolio 
in addition  the degree of discrepancy between our asking rents and the actual rents we are able to obtain may vary both from property to property and among different leased spaces within a single property 
if we are unable to obtain rental rates that are on average comparable to our asking rents across our portfolio  then our ability to generate cash flow growth will 
table of contents be negatively impacted 
in addition  depending on asking rental rates at any given time as compared to expiring leases in our portfolio  from time to time rental rates for expiring leases may be higher than starting rental rates for new leases 
some of our properties are subject to ground leases  the termination or expiration of which could cause us to lose our interest in  and the right to receive rental income from  such properties 
the wilshire boulevard property  acres of the sunset gower property and a portion representing of the building area of the kearny street property excluding the sutter building are subject to ground leases 
if any of these ground leases are terminated following a default or expire without being extended  we may lose our interest in the related property and may no longer have the right to receive any of the rental income from such property  which would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
the ground sublease for the del amo office property is subject and subordinate to a ground lease  the termination of which could result in a termination of the ground sublease 
the property on which the del amo office building is located is subleased by del amo fashion center operating company  llc  a delaware limited liability company  or del amo  through a long term ground sublease 
the ground sublease is subject and subordinate to the terms of a ground lease between the fee owner of the del amo office property and the sub landlord under the ground sublease 
the fee owner has not granted to the subtenant under the ground sublease any rights of non disturbance 
accordingly  a termination of the ground lease for any reason  including a rejection thereof by the ground tenant under the ground lease in a bankruptcy proceeding  could result in a termination of the ground sublease 
in the event of a termination of the ground sublease  we may lose our interest in the del amo office building and may no longer have the right to receive any of the rental income from the del amo office building 
in addition  our lack of any non disturbance rights from the fee owner may impair our ability to obtain financing for the del amo office building 
our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
our continued success and our ability to manage anticipated future growth depend  in large part  upon the efforts of key personnel who have extensive market knowledge and relationships and exercise substantial influence over our operational  financing  acquisition and disposition activity 
many of our other senior executives have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate industry  which aid us in identifying opportunities  having opportunities brought to us  and negotiating with tenants and build to suit prospects 
the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team  or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  could adversely affect our business  diminish our investment opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders  business partners  existing and prospective tenants and industry personnel  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
potential losses  including from adverse weather conditions  natural disasters and title claims  may not be covered by insurance 
we carry commercial property including earthquake  liability and terrorism coverage on all the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy  in addition to other coverages  such as trademark and pollution coverage  that may be appropriate for certain of our properties 
we have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss  the cost of the coverage and industry practice 
however  we do not carry insurance for losses such as loss from riots or war because such coverage is not available or is not available at commercially reasonable rates 
some of our policies  like those covering losses due to terrorism or earthquakes  are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses  which could affect certain of our properties that are located in areas particularly susceptible to natural disasters 
all of the properties we currently own are located in california  an area especially susceptible to earthquakes 
in addition  we may discontinue earthquake  terrorism or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any such policies exceeds  in our judgment  the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss 
as a result  we may be required to incur significant costs in the event of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters 
if we or one or more of our tenants experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable costs in the future as the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated 
in the event that we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of one of our properties  we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications 
further reconstruction or improvement of such a property would likely require significant upgrades to meet zoning and building code 
table of contents requirements 
future terrorist activity or engagement in war by the us may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
terrorist attacks in the us and other acts of terrorism or war may result in declining economic activity  which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties 
a decrease in demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re lease our properties at these sites at lease rates equal to or above historical rates 
terrorist activities also could directly impact the value of our properties through damage  destruction  or loss  and the availability of insurance for these acts may be less  and cost more  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
to the extent that our tenants are impacted by future attacks  their businesses similarly could be adversely affected  including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases 
terrorist attacks and engagement in war by the us also may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade and may cause further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending and may result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies 
any one of these events may cause decline in the demand for our office and media and entertainment leased space  delay the time in which our new or renovated properties reach stabilized occupancy  increase our operating expenses  such as those attributable to increased physical security for our properties  and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital 
we may become subject to litigation  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
in the future we may become subject to litigation  including claims relating to our operations  offerings  and otherwise in the ordinary course of business 
some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us  some of which are not  or cannot be  insured against 
we generally intend to vigorously defend ourselves  however  we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future 
resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines  judgments or settlements  which  if uninsured  or if the fines  judgments and settlements exceed insured levels  could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows  thereby having an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities 
certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage  which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows  expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured  and or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors 
joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on co venturers financial condition and disputes between us and our co venturers 
we may co invest in the future with third parties through partnerships  joint ventures or other entities  acquiring non controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
in such event  we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
investments in partnerships  joint ventures or other entities may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not present were a third party not involved  including the possibility that partners or co venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions 
partners or co venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives  and they may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues 
such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor the partner or co venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture 
in addition  prior consent of our joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture  which would restrict our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture 
if we become a limited partner or non managing member in any partnership or limited liability company and such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a reit or require us to pay tax  we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity 
disputes between us and partners or co venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business 
consequently  actions by or disputes with partners or co venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk 
in addition  we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party partners or co venturers 
our joint ventures may be subject to debt and  in the current volatile credit market  the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls 

table of contents if we fail to maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
as part of our ongoing monitoring of internal controls we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls 
as a result of weaknesses that may be identified in our internal controls  we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation 
if we discover weaknesses  we will make efforts to improve our internal and disclosure controls 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations  which could affect our ability to remain listed with the nyse 
ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our securities 
risks related to the real estate industry our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and the real estate industry 
our ability to pay expected dividends to our stockholders depends on our ability to generate revenues in excess of expenses  scheduled principal payments on debt and capital expenditure requirements 
events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties 
these events include many of the risks set forth above under risks related to our properties and our business  as well as the following local oversupply or reduction in demand for office or media and entertainment related space  adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers  sellers and tenants of properties  vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms  including possible market pressures to offer tenants rent abatements  tenant improvements  early termination rights or below market renewal options  and the need to periodically repair  renovate and re let space  increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  utilities  real estate taxes and state and local taxes  civil unrest  acts of war  terrorist attacks and natural disasters  including earthquakes and floods  which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses  decreases in the underlying value of our real estate  and changing submarket demographics 
in addition  periods of economic downturn or recession  rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur  could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases  which would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities 
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition 
the real estate investments made  and to be made  by us are relatively difficult to sell quickly 
as a result  our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions is limited 
return of capital and realization of gains  if any  from an investment generally will occur upon disposition or refinancing of the underlying property 
we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale  other disposition or refinancing at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy 
in particular  our ability to dispose of one or more properties within a specific time period is subject to certain limitations imposed by our tax protection agreements  as well as weakness in or even the lack of an established market for a property  changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers  changes in national or international economic conditions  such as the current economic downturn  and changes in laws  regulations or fiscal policies of jurisdictions in which the property is located 

table of contents in addition  the code imposes restrictions on a reit s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies 
in particular  the tax laws applicable to reits effectively require that we hold our properties for investment  rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business  which may cause us to forgo or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest 
therefore  we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities 
we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and litigation over environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  as a current or former owner or operator of real property  we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances  waste or petroleum products at  on  in  under or migrating from such property  including costs to investigate  clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such contamination  and the liability may be joint and several 
these liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation  removal  fines or other costs could exceed the value of the property and or our aggregate assets 
in addition  the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third party liability for costs of remediation and or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell  lease or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral 
in addition  environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination 
moreover  if contamination is discovered on our properties  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated  and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures 
some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property  or adjacent properties  for commercial or industrial purposes 
such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials 
as a result  we could potentially incur material liability for these issues  which could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of acbm and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third party liability eg  liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos 
such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing acbm and employers in such buildings properly manage and maintain the asbestos and lead  adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with asbestos or lead  and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos or lead would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
some of our properties contain acbm and we could be liable for such damages  fines or penalties 
in addition  the properties in our portfolio also are subject to various federal  state and local environmental and health and safety requirements  such as state and local fire requirements 
moreover  some of our tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties  which are subject to regulation 
such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities 
environmental liabilities could affect a tenant s ability to make rental payments to us 
in addition  changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance 
this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations  or those of our tenants  which could in turn have an adverse effect on us 
we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the per share trading price of our securities 
if we do incur material environmental liabilities in the future  we may face significant remediation costs  and we may find it difficult to sell any affected properties 
our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation  chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources  and other biological contaminants such as pollen  viruses and bacteria 
indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants 
table of contents above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation 
in addition  the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury is alleged to have occurred 
we may incur significant costs complying with various federal  state and local laws  regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties 
the properties in our portfolio are subject to various covenants and federal  state and local laws and regulatory requirements  including permitting and licensing requirements 
local regulations  including municipal or local ordinances  zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials of community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties  including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties 
among other things  these restrictions may relate to fire and safety  seismic or hazardous material abatement requirements 
there can be no assurance that existing laws and regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations  or that additional regulations will not be adopted that increase such delays or result in additional costs 
our growth strategy may be affected by our ability to obtain permits  licenses and zoning relief 
our failure to obtain such permits  licenses and zoning relief or to comply with applicable laws could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities 
in addition  federal and state laws and regulations  including laws such as the ada impose further restrictions on our properties and operations 
under the ada  all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
some of our properties may currently be in non compliance with the ada 
if one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ada or any other regulatory requirements  we may be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance and we might incur governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants 
in addition  we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities 
we are exposed to risks associated with property development 
we may engage in development and redevelopment activities with respect to certain of our properties 
to the extent that we do so  we will be subject to certain risks  including the availability and pricing of financing on favorable terms or at all  construction and or lease up delays  cost overruns  including construction costs that exceed our original estimates  contractor and subcontractor disputes  strikes  labor disputes or supply disruptions  failure to achieve expected occupancy and or rent levels within the projected time frame  if at all  and delays with respect to obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary zoning  occupancy  land use and other governmental permits  and changes in zoning and land use laws 
these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and  under certain circumstances  could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities 
risks related to our organizational structure as of december   the farallon funds owned an approximate beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis and have the ability to exercise significant influence on our company 
as of december   investment funds affiliated with farallon capital management  llc  or farallon  which we refer to as the farallon funds  owned an approximate beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis 
consequently  the farallon funds may be able to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder action  including the election of our board of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  including business combinations  consolidations and mergers 
in addition  one member of our board of directors is a managing member of farallon 
as a result  the farallon funds have substantial influence on us and could exercise their influence in a manner that conflicts with the interests of other stockholders 

table of contents the series a preferred units that were issued to some contributors in connection with our initial public offering in exchange for the contribution of their properties have certain preferences  which could limit our ability to pay dividends or other distributions to the holders of our securities or engage in certain business combinations  recapitalizations or other fundamental changes 
in exchange for the contribution of properties to our portfolio in connection with our initial public offering  some contributors received series a preferred units in our operating partnership  which units have an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million and have a preference as to distributions and upon liquidation that could limit our ability to pay dividends on our series b preferred stock and our common stock 
the series a preferred units are senior to any other class of securities our operating partnership may issue in the future without the consent of the holders of the series a preferred units 
as a result  we will be unable to issue partnership units in our operating partnership senior to the series a preferred units without the consent of the holders of series a preferred units 
any preferred stock in our company that we issue will be subordinate to the series a preferred units 
in addition  we may only engage in a fundamental change  including a recapitalization  a merger and a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  as a result of which our common stock ceases to be publicly traded or common units cease to be exchangeable at our option for publicly traded shares of our stock  without the consent of holders of series a preferred units if following such transaction we will maintain certain leverage ratios and equity requirements  and pay certain minimum tax distributions to holders of our outstanding series a preferred units 
alternatively  we may redeem all or any portion of the then outstanding series a preferred units for cash at a price per unit equal to the redemption price 
if we choose to redeem the outstanding series a preferred units in connection with a fundamental change  this could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our series b preferred stock and our common stock 
in addition  these provisions could increase the cost of any such fundamental change transaction  which may discourage a merger  combination or change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests 
our common stock is ranked junior to our series b preferred stock 
our common stock is ranked junior to our series b preferred stock 
our outstanding series b preferred stock also has or will have a preference upon our dissolution  liquidation or winding up in respect of assets available for distribution to our stockholders 
holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity securities  including classes or series of additional preferred stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offering 
thus  our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per share trading price of our common stock and diluting their interest in us 
conflicts of interest exist or could arise in the future between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of holders of units in our operating partnership  which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders 
conflicts of interest exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates  on the one hand  and our operating partnership or any partner thereof  on the other 
our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company 
at the same time  we  as the general partner of our operating partnership  have fiduciary duties and obligations to our operating partnership and its limited partners under maryland law and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership in connection with the management of our operating partnership 
our fiduciary duties and obligations as general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company 
additionally  the partnership agreement provides that we and our directors and officers will not be liable or accountable to our operating partnership for losses sustained  liabilities incurred or benefits not derived if we  or such director or officer acted in good faith 
the partnership agreement also provides that we will not be liable to the operating partnership or any partner for monetary damages for losses sustained  liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by the operating partnership or any limited partner  except for liability for our intentional harm or gross negligence 
moreover  the partnership agreement provides that our operating partnership is required to indemnify us and our directors  officers and employees  officers and employees of the operating partnership and our designees from and against any and all claims that relate to the operations of our operating partnership  except if the act or omission of the person was material to the matter giving rise to the action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty  for any transaction for which the indemnified party received an improper personal benefit  in money  property or services or otherwise  in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or in the case of a criminal proceeding  if the indemnified person had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful 
no reported decision of a maryland appellate court has interpreted provisions similar to the provisions of the partnership agreement of our operating partnership that modify and reduce our 
table of contents fiduciary duties or obligations as the general partner or reduce or eliminate our liability for money damages to the operating partnership and its partners  and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability of the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to modify or reduce the fiduciary duties that would be in effect were it not for the partnership agreement 
we may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of the contribution and other agreements with members of our senior management and our affiliates because of our dependence on them and conflicts of interest 
each of victor j 
coleman  howard s 
stern and affiliates of the farallon funds are parties to contribution agreements with us pursuant to which we have acquired interests in our properties and assets 
in addition  messrs 
coleman and stern are parties to employment agreements with us 
we may choose not to enforce  or to enforce less vigorously  our rights under these agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with members of our senior management and the farallon funds  with possible negative impact on stockholders 
our charter and bylaws  the partnership agreement of our operating partnership and maryland law contain provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction  even if such a change in control may be in your interest  and as a result may depress the market price of our securities 
our charter contains certain ownership limits 
our charter contains various provisions that are intended to preserve our qualification as a reit and  subject to certain exceptions  authorize our directors to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to preserve our qualification as a reit 
for example  our charter prohibits the actual  beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than in value or number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of the outstanding shares of each of our common stock and series b preferred stock  and more than in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock 
our board of directors  in its sole and absolute discretion  may exempt a person  prospectively or retroactively  from these ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied 
in connection with our initial public offering and the offering of our series b preferred stock  our board of directors granted to the farallon funds and certain of their affiliates  which we refer to collectively as the farallon excepted holders  and to certain other persons  exemptions from the ownership limits  subject to various conditions and limitations 
the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock may discourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in management or of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or series b preferred stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests  or result in the transfer of shares acquired in excess of the restrictions to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and  as a result  the forfeiture by the acquirer of the benefits of owning the additional shares 
we could increase the number of authorized shares of stock  classify and reclassify unissued stock and issue stock without stockholder approval 
subject to the rights of holders of series b preferred stock to approve the classification or issuance of any class or series of stock ranking senior to the series b preferred stock  our board of directors has the power under our charter to amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we are authorized to issue  to authorize us to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock and set the terms of such newly classified or reclassified shares 
although our board of directors has no such intention at the present time  it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could  depending on the terms of such series  delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest 
certain provisions of maryland law could inhibit changes in control  which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest 
certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law  or mgcl  may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best interest of our stockholders  including business combination provisions that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof or an affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner  directly or indirectly  of or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock at any time within the two year period immediately prior to the date in question for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder  and thereafter impose fair price 
table of contents and or supermajority and stockholder voting requirements on these combinations  and control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company defined as shares that  when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder  entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding all interested shares 
as permitted by the mgcl  we have elected  by resolution of our board of directors  to exempt from the business combination provisions of the mgcl  any business combination that is first approved by our disinterested directors and  pursuant to a provision in our bylaws  to exempt any acquisition of our stock from the control share provisions of the mgcl 
however  our board of directors may by resolution elect to repeal the exemption from the business combination provisions of the mgcl and may by amendment to our bylaws opt into the control share provisions of the mgcl at any time in the future 
certain provisions of the mgcl permit our board of directors  without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws  to implement certain corporate governance provisions  some of which for example  a classified board are not currently applicable to us 
these provisions may have the effect of limiting or precluding a third party from making an unsolicited acquisition proposal for us or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our charter contains a provision whereby we have elected to be subject to the provisions of title  subtitle of the mgcl relating to the filling of vacancies on our board of directors 
certain provisions in the partnership agreement of our operating partnership may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us 
provisions in the partnership agreement of our operating partnership may delay or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes of our control 
these provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control  although some stockholders might consider such proposals  if made  desirable 
these provisions include  among others redemption rights of qualifying parties  transfer restrictions on units  our ability  as general partner  in some cases  to amend the partnership agreement and to cause the operating partnership to issue units with terms that could delay  defer or prevent a merger or other change of control of us or our operating partnership without the consent of the limited partners  the right of the limited partners to consent to transfers of the general partnership interest and mergers or other transactions involving us under specified circumstances  and restrictions on debt levels and equity requirements pursuant to the terms of our series a preferred units  as well as required distributions to holders of series a preferred units of our operating partnership  following certain changes of control of us 
our charter  bylaws  the partnership agreement of our operating partnership and maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest 
our board of directors may change our investment and financing policies without stockholder approval and we may become more highly leveraged  which may increase our risk of default under our debt obligations 
our investment and financing policies are exclusively determined by our board of directors 
accordingly  our stockholders do not control these policies 
further  our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness  funded or otherwise  that we may incur 
our board of directors may alter or eliminate our current policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder approval 
if this policy changed  we could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increase in our debt service 
higher leverage also increases the risk of default on our obligations 
in addition  a change in our investment policies  including the manner in which we allocate our resources across our portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest  may increase our exposure to interest rate risk  real estate market fluctuations and liquidity risk 
changes to our policies with regards to the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and per share trading price of our securities 

table of contents our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 
our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages  except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 
in addition  our charter authorizes us to obligate our company  and our bylaws require us  to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those and certain other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law 
as a result  we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist 
accordingly  in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our directors or officers impede the performance of our company  your ability to recover damages from such director or officer will be limited 
tax protection agreements could limit our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of certain properties 
in connection with our formation transactions for our ipo  we entered into tax protection agreements with certain third party contributors that provide that if we dispose of any interest with respect to the first financial or tierrasanta properties in a taxable transaction during the period from the closing of our initial public offering on june  through certain specified dates ranging until  we will indemnify the third party contributors for certain tax liabilities payable as a result of the sale as well as tax liabilities payable as a result of the reimbursement payment 
certain contributors rights under the tax protection agreements with respect to these properties will  however  expire at various times depending on the rights of such partner during the period beginning in and prior to the expiration  in  of the maximum period for indemnification 
the first financial and tierrasanta properties represented approximately of our office portfolio s annualized base rent as of december  we have no present intention to sell or otherwise dispose of the properties or interest therein in taxable transactions during the restriction period 
if we were to trigger the tax protection provisions under these agreements  we would be required to pay damages in the amount of certain taxes payable by these contributors plus additional damages in the amount of the taxes incurred as a result of such payment 
in addition  although it may otherwise be in our stockholders best interest that we sell one of these properties  it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so because of these obligations 
our tax protection agreements may require our operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels that otherwise would not be required to operate our business 
our tax protection agreements provide that during the period from the closing of our initial public offering on june   through certain specified dates ranging from to  our operating partnership will offer certain holders of units who continue to hold the units received in respect of the formation transactions the opportunity to guarantee debt 
if we fail to make such opportunities available  we will be required to indemnify such holders for certain tax liabilities resulting from our failure to make such opportunities available to them and any tax liabilities payable as a result of the indemnity payment 
we agreed to these provisions in order to assist certain contributors in deferring the recognition of taxable gain as a result of and after the formation transactions 
these obligations may require us to maintain more or different indebtedness than we would otherwise require for our business 
we are a holding company with no direct operations and  as such  we rely on funds received from our operating partnership to pay liabilities  and the interests of our stockholders are structurally subordinated to all liabilities and obligations of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership 
we do not have  apart from an interest in our operating partnership  any independent operations 
as a result  we rely on distributions from our operating partnership to pay any dividends we might declare on our common stock and on shares of our series b preferred stock 
we also rely on distributions from our operating partnership to meet our obligations  including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to us from our operating partnership 
in addition  because we are a holding company  claims of our equity holders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations whether or not for borrowed money of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and subordinate to the rights of holders of series a preferred units 
therefore  in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization  our assets and those of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and our operating 
table of contents partnership s and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full 
risks related to our status as a reit failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 
we intend to elect to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes on our federal income tax return for our taxable year ending december  we believe that we have operated  and we intend to continue operating  in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service  or irs  that we qualify as a reit  and the statements in this annual report are not binding on the irs or any court 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will qualify as a reit  or that we will remain qualified as such in the future 
if we lose our reit status  we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to you for each of the years involved because we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  and unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for  among other things  our operations and distributions to stockholders 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders 
as a result of all these factors  our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital  and could materially and adversely affect the value of our securities 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code  or the treasury regulations  is greater in the case of a reit that  like us  holds its assets through a partnership 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
in order to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy a number of requirements  including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock  requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources  such as rents from real property 
also  we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least of our net taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may materially adversely affect our investors  our ability to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we may be subject to some federal  state and local income  property and excise taxes on our income or property and  in certain cases  a penalty tax  in the event we sell property as a dealer 
in addition  our taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to tax as regular corporations in the jurisdictions they operate 
our ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries is subject to certain restrictions  and we will be required to pay a penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not conducted on arm s length terms 
we currently own an interest in one taxable reit subsidiary and may acquire securities in additional taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
a taxable reit subsidiary is a corporation other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock  and that has made a joint election with such reit to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary 
if a taxable reit subsidiary owns more than of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation  such other corporation will also be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary 
other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities  a taxable reit subsidiary may generally engage in any business  including the provision of customary or non customary services to tenants of its parent reit 
a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular c corporation 
in addition  a excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a taxable reit subsidiary and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
a reit s ownership of securities of a taxable reit subsidiary is not subject to the or asset tests applicable to reits 
not more than of our total assets may be represented by 
table of contents securities  including securities of taxable reit subsidiaries  other than those securities includable in the asset test 
we anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any taxable reit subsidiaries and other nonqualifying assets that we own will be less than of the value of our total assets  and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations 
in addition  we intend to structure our transactions with any taxable reit subsidiaries that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm s length terms to avoid incurring the excise tax described above 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to comply with the limitation or to avoid application of the excise tax discussed above 
to maintain our reit status  we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions 
to qualify as a reit  we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least of our net taxable income each year  excluding net capital gains  and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than of our net taxable income each year 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
in order to maintain our reit status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes  we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings 
these borrowing needs could result from  among other things  differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes  or the effect of non deductible capital expenditures  the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 
these sources  however  may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends on a number of factors  including the market s perception of our growth potential  our current debt levels  the market price of our common stock  and our current and potential future earnings 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times  or at all  which may cause us to curtail our investment activities and or to dispose of assets at inopportune times  and could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  cash available for distributions to our stockholders  and per share trading price of our securities 
complying with reit requirements may affect our profitability and may force us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments 
to qualify as a reit  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the nature and diversification of our assets  the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders 
we may be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions 
we also may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
as a result  having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to i sell assets in adverse market conditions  ii borrow on unfavorable terms  or iii distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt 
accordingly  satisfying the reit requirements could have an adverse effect on our business results  profitability and ability to execute our business plan 
moreover  if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset  income or distribution tests  or to repay obligations to our lenders  we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions 
legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 
the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury 
changes to the tax laws  with or without retroactive application  could adversely affect our investors or us 
we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us 
new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification

media and entertainment portfolio our portfolio of operating properties includes two properties that we consider to be media and entertainment properties  encompassing an aggregate of  square feet 
we define our media and entertainment properties as those properties in our portfolio that are primarily used for the physical production of media content  such as television programs  feature films  commercials  music videos and photographs 
these properties generally also feature a traditional office component that is leased to production companies and content providers 
for the months ended december   our media and entertainment properties were approximately leased 
our media and entertainment properties are located in 
table of contents prime southern california submarkets 
leasing characteristics of media and entertainment properties the duration of typical lease terms for tenants of media and entertainment properties tends to be shorter than those of traditional office properties 
generally  terms of the media and entertainment leases are one year or less  as tenants are never certain as to whether their productions will continue to be carried by networks or cable channels 
however  historically  many entertainment tenants have exercised renewal options such that their actual tenancy is extended for multiple years 
as an example  productions such as judge judy  judge joe brown  family feud and hannah montana have been tenants at sunset bronson studios for between three and years 
at sunset gower studios  nbc s heroes was a tenant for four years prior to its cancellation and showtime s dexter has been a tenant for three years 
additionally  occupancy levels for sound stage space and office and support space tend to run in parallel  as a majority of stage users also require office and support space 
in addition  we require tenants at our media and entertainment properties to use our facilities for items such as lighting  equipment rental  parking  power  hvac and telecommunications telephone and internet 
as a result  our other property related revenues tend to track overall occupancy of our media and entertainment properties 
as a result of the short term nature of the leases into which we enter at our media and entertainment properties  and because entertainment industry tenants generally do not shoot on weekends due to higher costs  we believe stabilized occupancy rates at our media and entertainment properties are lower than those rates achievable at our traditional office assets  where tenants enter into longer term lease arrangements

executive summary through our interest in hudson pacific properties  lp our operating partnership and its subsidiaries  at december  our consolidated office portfolio consisted of approximately million square feet  and our media and entertainment portfolio consisted of million square feet 
as of december   our consolidated office portfolio was leased including leases not yet commenced 
our media and entertainment properties were leased for the trailing month period ended december  current year acquisitions  repositionings and financings 
acquisitions 
in the third quarter of we completed three acquisitions  including arizona  brannan  and second street on july   august  and september   respectively 
on november  we acquired hollywood boulevard 
on december  we acquired sunset and beachwood  which 
table of contents together comprise  square feet of office property ancillary to our sunset gower property 
dispositions 
we did not dispose of any properties in repositionings 
we generally select a property for repositioning at the time we purchase it 
we often strategically purchase properties with large vacancies or expected near term lease roll over and use our knowledge of the property and submarket to determine the optimal use and tenant mix 
a repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property  and may involve a complete structural renovation of a building to significantly upgrade the character of the property  or it may involve targeted remodeling of common areas and tenant spaces to make the property more attractive to certain identified tenants 
because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property  tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket  the results are varying degrees of depressed rental revenue and occupancy levels for the affected property  which impacts our results and  accordingly  comparisons of our performance from period to period 
the repositioning process generally occurs over the course of months or even years 
although usually associated with newly acquired properties  repositioning efforts can also occur at properties we already own  repositioning properties discussed in the context of this paragraph exclude acquisition properties where the plan for improvement is implemented as part of the acquisition 
during  we completed our repositioning of our howard street property and acquired brannan for purposes of repositioning 
financings 
on february   we closed a five year term loan totaling million with wells fargo bank  na secured by our sunset gower and sunset bronson media and entertainment campuses 
proceeds from the loan were used to fully refinance a million mortgage loan secured by our sunset bronson property that was scheduled to mature on april  the remaining proceeds were used to partially pay down our million secured credit facility 
on june  we repaid the million loan secured by our tierrasanta property  on september  we repaid the million loan secured by our first financial property  and on december  we repaid the million loan secured by our washington property 
in connection with our acquisitions of the second street and hollywood boulevard properties  we assumed project level financing of million and million  respectively  the first of which is scheduled to mature on february  and the second on january  in connection with the aforementioned loan repayments and our property acquisitions we drew on our secured revolving credit facility  as follows million on august   million on september   million on november   million on december  and million on december   resulting in a total outstanding balance under our secured revolving credit facility was million on december  subsequent to year end  we completed the financings and public offering described subsequent events below and applied proceeds from those to repay indebtedness under its secured revolving credit facility such that there was no outstanding balance under the facility as of the date of this report 
we have no financing maturing in the calendar year 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of hudson pacific properties  inc and our subsidiaries  including our operating partnership 
the results of the properties described under acquisitions above are included in our consolidated results as of the date of their respective acquisition 
similarly  the financings described under financings above are included in our consolidated results on the date that the asset as to which a loan has been assumed was acquired or as of the date of the applicable loan draw in the case of draws under our secured credit facility 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
for periods prior to  we have reclassified certain other property related revenue and tenant recoveries relating to our media and entertainment properties that had been included as an offset to corresponding operating expenses  such that our media and entertainment rental revenue  other property related revenue  and tenant recoveries  and our media and entertainment operating expenses reflect the gross revenue and gross expenses  as applicable  without regard to such offset 
in addition  for periods prior to  we have reclassified office related parking revenue from tenant recoveries to parking and other 
these reclassifications conform the periods prior to with the current period presentation 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  and they include  in our opinion  all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the financial information set forth therein 

table of contents factors that may influence our operating results business and strategy we focus our investment strategy on office properties located in submarkets with growth potential as well as on underperforming properties or portfolios that provide opportunities to implement a value add strategy to increase occupancy rates and cash flow 
additionally  we intend to acquire properties or portfolios that are distressed due to near term debt maturities or underperforming properties where we believe better management  focused leasing efforts and or capital improvements would improve the property s operating performance and value 
our strategy also includes active management  aggressive leasing efforts  focused capital improvement programs  the reduction and containment of operating costs and an emphasis on tenant satisfaction  which we believe will minimize turnover costs and improve occupancy 
from the acquisition of our first property in february through december  we have acquired or developed properties totaling an aggregate of approximately million square feet 
we intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties as a key part of our growth strategy  often including properties that may have substantial vacancy  which enables us to increase cash flow through lease up 
we expect to continue to acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to incur indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties 
debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any dividends with respect to our common or series b preferred stock and our common and series a preferred units 
rental revenue the amount of net rental revenue generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that becomes available from lease terminations 
as of december   the percent leased for our office properties was approximately or  excluding leases signed but not commenced as of that date  and the percent leased for the media and entertainment properties based on month trailing average was approximately 
the amount of rental revenue generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
we believe that the average rental rates for our office properties are generally equal to or modestly below the current average quoted market rate  with the exception of our lease of  square feet to burlington coat factory at our howard street property and our lease of approximately  square feet to bank of america at our market property  which we believe to be substantially below market rates 
we believe the average rental rates for our media and entertainment properties are generally equal to current average quoted market rates 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue in future periods 
future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets or downturns in our tenants industries that impair our ability to renew or re let space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments  as in the case of tenant bankruptcies  could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
in addition  growth in rental revenue will also partially depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria 
conditions in our markets the properties in our portfolio are all located in california submarkets 
positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions in california  including the state budgetary shortfall  employment rates  natural hazards and other factors  may impact our overall performance 
operating expenses our operating expenses generally consist of utilities  property and ad valorem taxes  insurance and site maintenance costs 
increases in these expenses over tenants base years are generally passed on to tenants in our full service gross leased properties and are generally paid in full by tenants in our net lease properties 
certain of our properties have been reassessed for property tax purposes as a result of our initial public offer or their subsequent acquisition and other reassessments remain pending 
in the case of completed reassessments  the amount of property taxes we pay reflect the valuations established with the county assessors for the relevant locations of each property as of the initial public offering or their subsequent acquisition 
with respect to pending reassessments  we similarly expect the amount of property taxes we pay to reflect the valuations established with such county assessors 
taxable reit subsidiary as part of the formation transactions  we formed hudson pacific services  inc  or our services company  a maryland corporation that is wholly owned by our operating partnership 
we have elected  together with our services company  to treat 
table of contents our services company as a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes  and we may form additional taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
our services company generally may provide both customary and non customary services to our tenants and engage in other activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a reit 
our services company and its wholly owned subsidiaries provide a number of services to certain tenants at our media and entertainment properties and  from time to time  one or more taxable reit subsidiaries may provide services to our tenants at these and other properties 
in addition  our operating partnership has contributed some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company 
we currently lease space to wholly owned subsidiaries of our services company at our media and entertainment properties and may  from time to time  enter into additional leases with one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
any income earned by our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the or gross income tests  except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend  in which case such dividend income will qualify under the  but not the  gross income test 
because a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal income tax  and state and local income tax where applicable  as a regular c corporation  the income earned by our taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations of hudson pacific properties  inc are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable as of the date hereof 
other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial conditions to those of other companies 
investment in real estate properties the properties in our portfolio are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we account for the cost of an acquisition  including the assumption of liabilities  to the acquired tangible assets and identifiable intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with gaap 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors  including historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant 
acquisition related expenses are expensed in the period incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with gaap 
impairment losses are recorded on real estate assets held for investment when indicators of impairment are present and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
we recognize impairment losses to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the properties 
properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
we did not record any impairment charges related to our real estate assets and related intangibles during the years ended december  and accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due for monthly rents and other charges 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  including an allowance for straight line rent receivables  for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments 
we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis 
this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions  property performance  credit enhancements and other factors 
for straight line rent amounts  our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease 
at december   management believed that the collectability of straight line rent balances are reasonably assured  however  a allowance was established against straight line rent receivables 
we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of uncollectible accounts and our historical collection experience 
we 
table of contents recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
historical experience has been within management s expectations 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue from tenants on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset 
for assets acquired subject to leases  we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset  provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset 
if the lease provides for tenant improvements  we determine whether the tenant improvements  for accounting purposes  are owned by the tenant or us 
when we are the owner of the tenant improvements  the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed 
when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements  any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term 
tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including  but not limited to whether the lease stipulates how and on which items a tenant improvement allowance may be spent  whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term  whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general purpose in nature  and whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease 
certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds 
such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant  or estimates of tenant results  exceed the base amount or other thresholds 
such revenue is recognized only after the contingency has been removed when the related thresholds are achieved  which may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received 
other property related revenue is revenue that is derived from the tenants use of lighting  equipment rental  parking  power  hvac and telecommunications telephone and internet 
other property related revenue is recognized when these items are provided 
tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes  insurance  repairs and maintenance  and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
the reimbursements are recognized and presented gross  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  and we have discretion in selecting the supplier and bear the associated credit risk 
we recognize gains on sales of properties upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser 
gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when i the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured  ii we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale  iii the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and iv other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied 
gains on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met 
stock based compensation asc topic  compensation stock compensation referred to as asc topic and formerly known as fasb r  requires us to recognize an expense for the fair value of equity based compensation awards 
grants of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance units under our equity incentive award plans are accounted for under asc topic our compensation committee will regularly consider the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions  especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs 
income taxes our taxable income prior to the completion of our initial public offering is reportable by the members of the limited liability companies that comprise our predecessor 
our property owning subsidiaries are limited liability companies and are treated as pass through entities for income tax purposes 
accordingly  no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the activities of these entities 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code commencing with our initial taxable year 
we believe that we have operated  and we intend to continue operating  in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet the various other requirements imposed by the code relating to such matters as operating results  asset holdings  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership 
provided that 
table of contents we continue to qualify for taxation as a reit  we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders that we derive from our reit qualifying activities 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the code  all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  including any applicable alternative minimum tax 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we would be ineligible to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose our qualification 
it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief 
we have elected to treat one of our subsidiaries as a taxable reit subsidiary 
certain activities that we may undertake  such as non customary services for our tenants and holding assets that we cannot hold directly  will be conducted by a taxable reit subsidiary 
a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and  where applicable  state income taxes on its net income 
we are subject to the statutory requirements of the state in which we conduct business

liquidity and capital resources analysis of liquidity and capital resources we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents at december  in addition  the lead arrangers for our secured revolving credit facility have secured commitments that will allow borrowings of up to million 
as of december   we had total borrowing capacity of approximately million on our secured credit facility  of which million had been drawn 
on january   we closed a ten year term loan totaling million with pnc bank  national association secured by the first financial plaza property 
on january  we closed the public offering of  shares of our series b cumulative preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share 
on february   we closed a year term loan totaling million with cantor commercial real estate lending  lp  secured by our washington property 
we used million of proceeds from the first financial plaza financing  million of proceeds from the series b preferred stock offering and million of proceeds from the washington financing  to fully pay down our million secured credit facility 
as a result  as of the filing of this report we have capacity of approximately million on our secured credit facility  none of which has been drawn 
we intend to use the secured revolving credit facility  among other things  to finance the acquisition of other properties  to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes 
based on the closing price of our common stock of as of march   our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately counting series a preferred units as debt 
our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock which may decrease  thereby increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio  including restricted stock that we may issue to certain of our directors and executive officers  plus the 
table of contents aggregate value of common units not owned by us  plus the liquidation preference of outstanding series a preferred units  plus the liquidation preference of outstanding series b preferred stock  plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness 
our short term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties  distributions to our limited partners and dividend payments to our stockholders required to maintain our reit status  capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations  reserves established from existing cash and by drawing upon our secured revolving credit facility 
our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary for the repayment of debt at maturity  property acquisitions and non recurring capital improvements 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities 
we also may fund property acquisitions and non recurring capital improvements using our secured revolving credit facility pending permanent financing 
we believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long term liquidity requirements  including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity 
however  we cannot assure you that this is or will continue to be the case

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk 
our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
as more fully described below  we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
on february   we closed a five year term loan totaling million with wells fargo bank  na  secured by our sunset gower and sunset bronson media and entertainment properties 
the loan bears interest at a rate equal to one month libor plus

these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur 
further  in the event of a change in overall economic activity of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
as of december   our total outstanding debt was approximately million before unamortized loan premium  which was comprised of a million line of credit not mitigated by interest rate contracts  million of variable rate secured mortgage loans subject to the interest rate agreements described above and million before unamortized loan premium of fixed rate secured mortgage loans
