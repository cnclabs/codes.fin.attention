impact from thailand flood in october  we announced that flood waters had severely impacted the inventory and production operations of our primary contract manufacturer in thailand 
the impacted areas included certain product lines for the telecom and cable television catv market segments 
this has had a significant impact on our operations and our ability to meet customer demand for certain of our fiber optics products in the near term 
our photovoltaics segment was not affected by the thailand floods 
since that announcement  we have developed and implemented a plan to rebuild the impacted production lines at other locations  including an alternate facility of our contract manufacturer in thailand  as well as our own manufacturing facilities in the united states and china 
our production line for itlas integrable tunable laser assemblies for and gb s gigabit per second coherent telecom applications has been up and running since april at our contract manufacturer in thailand 
production line qualification has been completed and most customers have successfully completed full line audits and started taking shipments in april 
as of september  our itla line is operating at pre flood capacity production levels 
the catv laser module and transmitter production lines at our manufacturing facility in china reached pre flood capacity production levels as of september see

table of contents sale of fiber optics related assets on march   we entered into a master purchase agreement with a subsidiary of sumitomo electric industries  ltd sei  pursuant to which we agreed to sell certain assets and transfer certain obligations associated with our fiber optics segment 
on may   we completed the sale of these assets to sei and recorded a gain of approximately million 
the assets sold included inventory  fixed assets  and intellectual property which enabled approximately million of revenue from sales of datacom  parallel optical devices and emcore connects cable products during the fiscal year ended september  under the terms of the master purchase agreement  we have agreed to indemnify sei for up to million of potential claims and expenses for the two year period following the sale  and we have recorded this amount as a deferred gain on our balance sheet as of september  as a result of these contingencies 
sei paid million in cash and deposited approximately million into escrow as security for indemnification obligations and any purchase price adjustments 
payment of escrow amounts occurs over a two year period and is subject to claim adjustments 
in total  we have deferred approximately million of the total paid by sei as a gain on sale until the indemnification obligation of million and purchase price adjustment contingencies are resolved

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
the accounting estimates that require our most significant  difficult  and or subjective judgments include the valuation of inventory  goodwill  intangible assets  warrants  and stock based compensation  assessment of recovery of long lived assets  asset retirement obligations and litigation contingencies  revenue recognition associated with the percentage of completion method  the allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty accruals  and  estimation of losses associated with the thailand flood 
we develop estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available to us 
our reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions  particularly with respect to significant accounting policies 
in the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
a listing and description of our critical accounting policies includes the following accounts receivable we regularly evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us 
the allowance is based on the age of receivables and a specific identification of receivables considered at risk of collection 
we classify charges associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts as sales  general  and administrative expense 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  impacting their ability to pay us  additional allowances may be required 
see 
note receivables in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our receivables 

table of contents inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the standard cost method that includes material  labor  and manufacturing overhead costs  which approximates weighted average cost 
we write down inventory once it has been determined that conditions exist that may not allow the inventory to be sold for its intended purpose or the inventory is determined to be excess or obsolete based on our forecasted future revenue 
the charge related to inventory write downs is recorded as a cost of revenue 
the majority of the inventory write downs are related to estimated allowances for inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value and on excess raw material components resulting from finished product obsolescence 
in most cases where we sell previously written down inventory  it is typically sold as a component part of a finished product 
the finished product is sold at market price at the time resulting in higher average gross margin on such revenue 
we do not track the selling price of individual raw material components that have been previously written down or written off  since such raw material components usually are only a portion of the finished products and related sales price 
we evaluate inventory levels at least quarterly against sales forecasts on a significant part by part basis  in addition to determining its overall inventory risk 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur charges to write down our inventory 
see 
note inventory  net in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our inventory 
goodwill the company s goodwill of approximately million is associated with our photovoltaics segment 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
pursuant to asc  circumstances that could trigger an interim impairment test include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions  limitations on accessing capital  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  or other developments in equity and credit markets  industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates  an increased competitive environment  a decline in market dependent multiples or metrics considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers  a change in the market for an entity s products or services  or a regulatory or political development  cost factors such as increases in raw materials  labor  or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows  overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods  other relevant entity specific events such as changes in management  key personnel  strategy  or customers  contemplation of bankruptcy  or litigation  events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets  a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all  or a portion  of a reporting unit  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit  and  if applicable  a sustained decrease in share price considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers 

table of contents in performing goodwill impairment testing  we are able to review qualitative factors in accordance with asu to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value 
if it is assessed that the fair value is more likely than not less than the carrying value  we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit using a weighted combination of a market based approach and a discounted cash flow dcf approach 
the market based approach relies on values based on market multiples derived from comparable public companies 
in applying the dcf approach  management forecasts cash flows over the remaining useful life of its primary asset using assumptions of current economic conditions and future expectations of earnings 
this analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment  including judgments about appropriate discount rates based on the assessment of risks inherent in the amount and timing of projected future cash flows 
the derived discount rate may fluctuate from period to period as it is based on external market conditions 
all of these assumptions are critical to the estimate and can change from period to period 
updates to these assumptions in future periods  particularly changes in discount rates  could result in different results of goodwill impairment tests

note goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our goodwill 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets 
because most of our long lived assets are subject to amortization  we review these assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of asc  property  plant  and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our impairment testing of long lived assets consists of determining whether the carrying amount of the long lived asset asset group is recoverable  in other words  whether the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset asset group exceeds its carrying amount 
the determination of the existence of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows related to an asset or group of assets 
in making this determination  we use certain assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  the length of service that assets will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values

revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided persuasive evidence of a contract exists  the price is fixed  the product meets our customer s specifications  title and ownership have transferred to the customer  and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
the majority of our products have shipping terms that are free on board or free carrier alongside fca shipping point  which means that we fulfill our delivery obligation when the goods are handed over to the freight carrier at our shipping dock 
this means the buyer typically bears all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods from that point 
in certain cases  we ship our products cost insurance and freight 
under this arrangement  revenue is recognized under fca shipping point terms  but we pay and invoice the customer for the cost of shipping and insurance to the customer s designated location 
we account for shipping and related transportation costs by recording the charges that are invoiced to customers as revenue  with the corresponding cost recorded as cost of revenue 
in those instances where inventory is maintained at a consigned location  revenue is recognized only when our customer pulls product for use and after title and ownership has transferred to the customer 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized at contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
any warranty cost and remaining obligations that are inconsequential or perfunctory are accrued when the corresponding revenue is recognized 
distributors 
we use a number of distributors around the world and recognize revenue upon shipment of product to these distributors 
title and risk of loss pass to the distributors upon shipment  and our distributors are contractually obligated to pay us on standard commercial terms  just like our other direct customers 
we do not sell to our distributors on consignment and  except in the event of product discontinuance  do not give distributors a right of return 
solar panel contracts 
pursuant to asc  revenue recognition construction type and production  we record revenue on long term solar panel contracts using either the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method 
in general  the performance of these types of contracts involves the design  development  and manufacture of complex aerospace or electronic equipment to our customer s specifications 
the percentage of completion method is used in circumstances in which all the following conditions exist 
table of contents the contract includes enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided to the customer  the consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement  both the company and the customer are expected to satisfy all of the contractual obligations  and  reasonably reliable estimates of total revenue  total cost  and the progress towards completion can be made 
the percentage of completion method recognizes estimates for contract revenue and costs in progress as work on the contract continues 
estimates are revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete a contract indicate a loss  a provision is made at that time for the total loss anticipated on the contract 
we use the completed contract method if reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made or for which inherent hazards make estimates doubtful 
under the completed contract method  contract revenue and costs in progress are deferred as work on the contract continues 
if a loss becomes evident on the contract  a provision is made at that time for the total loss anticipated on the contract 
total contract revenue and related costs are recognized upon the completion of the contract 
government research and development contracts 
revenue from research and development contracts represents reimbursement by various us government entities  or their contractors  to aid in the development of new technology 
the applicable contracts generally provide that we may elect to retain ownership of inventions made in performing the work  subject to a non exclusive license retained by the us government to practice the inventions for governmental purposes 
the research and development contract funding may be based on a cost plus  cost reimbursement  or a firm fixed price arrangement 
the amount of funding under each research and development contract is determined based on cost estimates that include both direct and indirect costs 
cost plus funding is determined based on actual costs plus a set margin 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  revenue is recorded 
contract costs include material  labor  special tooling and test equipment  subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
a research and development contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred  milestones have been reached  and any reporting obligations to the customer have been met 
these contracts may be modified or terminated at the convenience of the us government and may be subject to governmental budgetary fluctuations 
we also participate in cost sharing research and development arrangements 
under such arrangements in which the actual costs of performance are split between the us government and us on a best efforts basis  no revenue is recorded and our research and development expense is reduced for the amount of the cost sharing receipts 
multiple element arrangements 
contracts with our customers usually relate to either the delivery of product or the completion of technology or engineering research and development contracts 
in a very limited number of cases  a research contract may involve the creation and delivery of a customer designed product sample based upon the research and development efforts completed 
pursuant to asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  we have concluded that product revenue should not be considered a unit of accounting separate from the service revenue for these types of research contracts 
contract manufacturers 
in our fiber optics segment  prior to certain customers accepting product that is manufactured at one of our contract manufacturers  these customers require that they first qualify the product and manufacturing processes at our contract manufacturer 
the customers qualification process determines whether the product manufactured at our contract manufacturer achieves their quality  performance  and reliability standards 
after a customer completes the initial qualification process  we receive approval to ship qualified product to that customer 
as part of the manufacturing process at our contract manufacturers  the finished product is tested prior to shipment to the customer using the same criteria that our customer uses to test product it receives 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of customer qualified product  provided persuasive evidence of a contract exists  the price is fixed  the product meets our customer s specifications  title and ownership have transferred to the customer  and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 

table of contents product warranty reserves we provide our customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and warranty claims for certain products 
pursuant to asc  contingencies  we make estimates of product warranty expense using historical experience rates as a percentage of revenue and or costs of revenue and accrue estimated warranty expense as a cost of revenue 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on historical experience of known product failure rates and anticipated rates if warranty claims  use of materials to repair or replace defective products  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product issues 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than needed  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
see 
note accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our product warranty reserves 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the stock option grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recorded to cost of sales  sales  general  and administrative  and research and development expense based on an employee s responsibility and function over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model and the straight line attribution approach to determine the fair value of stock based awards in accordance with asc  compensation 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock  and expected forfeitures 
expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock based awards 
the expected stock price volatility is based on our historical stock prices 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our non cash stock based compensation expense could adversely affect our results of operations 
see 
note equity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our stock based compensation 
litigation contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims  and litigation  either asserted or unasserted that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable  we do not expect the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
professional legal fees are expensed when incurred 
we accrue for contingent losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
in the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
should we fail to prevail in any legal matter or should several legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  then the financial results of that particular reporting period could be materially affected 
see 
note commitments and contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to our legal proceedings 
warrant valuation as of september  and  warrants representing  shares of our common stock were outstanding 
all of our warrants are classified as a liability since the warrants meet the classification requirements for liability accounting pursuant to asc  derivatives and hedging 
each quarter  we expect an impact on our statement of operations when we record the change in fair value of our outstanding warrants using the monte carlo option valuation model 
the monte carlo option valuation model is used since it allows the valuation of each warrant to factor in the value associated with our right to affect a mandatory exercise of each warrant 
the valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the warrant s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the change in the fair value of the warrants is primarily due to the change in the closing price of our common stock 
see 
note fair value accounting in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our valuation of our outstanding warrants 

table of contents asset retirement obligations pursuant to asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations  an asset retirement obligation is recorded when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset and the fair value of the liability can reasonably be estimated 
upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation  a company increases the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
over time  the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to operations costs 
the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets through charges to depreciation  depletion  and or amortization 
if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes  an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 
revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates  escalating retirement costs  and changes in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations 
we have known conditional asset retirement conditions  such as certain asset decommissioning and restoration of rented facilities to be performed in the future 
during the three months ended september   we completed a review of our asset retirement and environmental obligations and we recorded an asset retirement obligation with an offset to fixed assets totaling million 
see 
note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our asset retirement obligations 
insurance recoveries insurance recoveries related to impairment losses previously recorded and other recoverable expenses will be recognized up to the amount of our related loss or expense in the period that recoveries become realizable 
insurance recoveries under business interruption coverage and insurance gains in excess of amounts previously written off related to impaired inventory and equipment or in excess of other recoverable expenses previously recognized will be recognized when they become realizable and all contingencies have been resolved 
the evaluation of insurance recoveries requires estimates and judgments about future results which affect reported amounts and certain disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
as of september   we have not recorded any estimated amounts relating to potential future insurance recoveries in our consolidated statement of operations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  us gaap specifically dictates the accounting treatment of a particular transaction 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  and other required us gaap disclosures  we refer you to the accompanying footnotes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report

our fiber optics segment is broken out into two distinct product lines broadband products  which includes cable television products  fiber to the premises products  satellite communication products  and defense and homeland security products  and  digital products  which include telecom optical products 
broadband product revenue for the fiscal year ended september   revenue from broadband products decreased from the prior year which was primarily driven by decreased unit shipments of our catv related products primarily due to the impact of the thailand flood 
fiscal revenue from broadband products increased approximately from fiscal which was primarily driven by increased unit shipments of our catv and video transport products 
the increase in catv unit shipments was primarily driven by our quadrature amplitude modulation qam transmitters and receivers 
digital product revenue fiscal revenue from digital products decreased from the prior year which was primarily due to the impact of the thailand flood on the telecom product lines 
our enterprise digital product lines were sold to sei in may fiscal revenue from digital products decreased approximately from fiscal which was primarily due to a reduction of approximately million of revenue associated with sales of parallel optics device products primarily as a result of the us international trade commission itc ruling 
see 
note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the itc ruling 
this was partially offset by increased shipments of telecom optical related products  which includes tunable xfp  tunable pin transponders  and integrated tunable laser assemblies itlas  when compared to fiscal our telecom optical related product line represents the second largest percentage of our total fiber optics related revenue 
our fiber optics segment accounted for  and of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 

table of contents photovoltaics revenue our photovoltaics reporting segment provides products for both space and terrestrial solar power applications 
for space solar power applications  we offer high efficiency multi junction solar cells  covered interconnect cells cics  and complete satellite solar panels 
for terrestrial powers applications  we offer high efficiency gaas solar cells fro concentrating photovoltaic cpv power systems 
for the fiscal year ended september   revenue from satellite applications decreased approximately from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily driven by lower volume sales of space solar cell cic products 
sales of our satellite solar cells and cics products represents the largest percentage of our total photovoltaics related revenue 
historically  our photovoltaics revenue has fluctuated significantly due to timing of program completions and product shipments of major orders 
revenue from our terrestrial related products was not significant as a percentage of total photovoltaics related revenue

historically  our cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  has fluctuated largely due to inventory and product warranty charges 
our gross margins are also affected by product mix  manufacturing yields and volumes  and timing related to the completion of long term contracts 
consolidated gross margins were  and for the fiscal year ended september   and  respectively

inventory excess and obsolescence expense totaled approximately million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
instead of completely rebuilding all flood damaged manufacturing lines in thailand  management has decided to realign the company s fiber optics product portfolio and focus on business areas with strong technology differentiation and growth opportunities 
management identified certain inventory on order related to manufacturing product lines that were destroyed by the thailand flood and will not be replaced 
this expense  which totaled million for the fiscal year ended september   was recorded within cost of revenue on our statement of operations and comprehensive loss 

table of contents for the fiscal year ended september   gross margins decreased from both our broadband and digital product lines when compared to the prior year 
during the period  lower revenues due to the impact from the thailand flood resulted in higher manufacturing overhead as a percentage of revenue 
manufacturing of certain fiber optics related components was moved to company owned facilities which involved higher labor and other related costs 
in fiscal  gross margins decreased from both our broadband and digital product lines when compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in expense associated with excess and obsolete inventories 
photovoltaics gross profit photovoltaics gross margin was  and for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   gross margins decreased from our satellite application product lines when compared to the prior year primarily due to lower revenues with unfavorable product mix changes  as well as lower manufacturing yields

stock based compensation expense within sg a totaled approximately million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the decrease in sg a expense for the fiscal year ended september  when compared to the prior year was attributable to cost reduction measures implemented which include a reduction of discretionary spending on staffing and infrastructure and due to the sale of our vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsel based and enterprise related product lines in may the decrease in sg a expense in fiscal when compared to fiscal is attributable to less accounts receivable reserves and corporate charges incurred during the period 
in fiscal  we recorded approximately  related to accounts receivable reserves 
during fiscal  we recorded a million reserve on accounts receivable related to a solar power system contract and we also incurred a million termination fee related to a then planned joint venture

we believe that in order to remain competitive  we must invest significant financial resources in developing new product features and enhancements and in maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
stock based compensation expense within r d totaled million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the decrease in r d expense for the fiscal year ended september  when compared to the prior year was attributable to cost reduction measures discussed above  as well as lower expense incurred related to our development of our txfp transceiver when compared to the prior year  and due to the sale of our vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsel based and enterprise related product lines in may in august  we signed a solar rooftop cpv development agreement with our suncore joint venture pursuant to which we collaborated on the development and application of the current x and next generation x rooftop cpv systems 
with the sale of the product lines to suncore in september  we will no longer be collaborating on these efforts 
during the fiscal year ended september   we billed suncore approximately million for research and developments costs incurred 
the increase in r d expense in fiscal when compared to fiscal is attributable to higher expenses incurred related to our development of our tunable xfp txfp transceiver in our fiber optics segment and increased r d expense incurred in our photovoltaics segment related to our acquisition of soliant energy which was completed in march as a percentage of revenue  r d expenses were  and for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively

the impairment test was triggered by a determination that it was more likely than not those assets would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
as a result of the evaluation  we determined that impairment existed and a charge of approximately million was recorded to write down the long lived assets to an estimated fair value 
of the total impairment charge  approximately million related to equipment and million related to intangible assets 
see 
note suncore joint venture in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to the recently signed definitive agreement which will consolidate the company s terrestrial cpv system engineering and development efforts into the company s joint venture 
as of september   we performed an impairment test of long lived assets associated with our digital fiber optics product lines 
the impairment test was triggered by a change in long term financial and cash flow forecasts 
the changes in financial and cash forecasts were not a result of the flooding in thailand 
the financial impact from this natural disaster was considered a fiscal year event 
as a result of our evaluation we determined that impairment existed and a charge of million was recorded to write down long lived assets to an estimated fair value which was determined using both the guideline public company valuation method and the discounted cash flow method 
see 
note intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this impairment charge 

table of contents litigation settlements  net in may  we reached a confidential settlement regarding certain outstanding litigation in exchange for a release of all related claims 
the settlement resulted in a charge of approximately million in our statement of operations and comprehensive loss and was paid during the three months ended june  in march  we received a cash payment of approximately million in satisfaction of a judgment for damages  net of legal fees which were incurred on a contingency basis  associated with a lawsuit against optium corporation  currently part of finisar corporation  for patent infringement of certain patents related to our fiber optics segment 
in june  we recorded million for legal settlements considered probable  which was later settled in september and paid in october for the amount accrued 
flood related loss recovery during the fiscal year  we recorded estimated flood related losses associated with damaged inventory and equipment of approximately million and million  respectively 
we continue to evaluate our estimates of flood related losses  and in future quarters we may record additional adjustments for damaged inventory and equipment

all of our warrants meet the classification requirements for liability accounting pursuant to asc  derivatives and hedging 
each quarter  we expect an impact on our statement of operations and comprehensive loss when we record the change in fair value of our outstanding warrants using the monte carlo option valuation model 
the monte carlo option valuation model is used since it allows the valuation of each warrant to factor in the value associated with our right to affect a mandatory exercise of each warrant 
the valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the warrant s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the change in the fair value of our warrants has been primarily due to the change in the closing price of our common stock

order backlog as of september   order backlog for our photovoltaics segment totaled million  a negligible decrease from million reported as of september  the backlog as of september  and included million and  respectively  of terrestrial solar cell orders from our suncore joint venture 
order backlog is defined as purchase orders or supply agreements accepted by us with expected product delivery and or services to be performed within the next twelve months 
from time to time  our customers may request that we delay shipment of certain orders and our order backlog could also be adversely affected if our customers unexpectedly cancel purchase orders that we have previously accepted 
product sales from our fiber optics segment are made pursuant to purchase orders  often with short lead times 
these orders are subject to revision or cancellation and often are made without deposits 
fiber optics products typically ship within the same quarter in which a purchase order is received  therefore  our order backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  we have consumed cash from operations and incurred significant net losses 
we have managed our liquidity position through a series of cost reduction initiatives  borrowings from our credit facility  capital markets transactions  and the sale of assets 
as of september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million and working capital totaled approximately million 
working capital  calculated as current assets minus current liabilities  is a financial metric we use which represents available operating liquidity 
for the fiscal year ended september   we incurred a net loss of million 
net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  totaled million 
with respect to measures taken to improve liquidity credit facility in november  we entered into a credit and security agreement credit facility with wells fargo bank wells fargo 
the credit facility provides us with a revolving credit of up to million through november that can be used for working capital requirements  letters of credit  and other general corporate purposes 
the credit facility was initially secured by the company s assets and is subject to a borrowing base formula based on the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventory accounts 
our credit facility contains customary representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants  including  among other things  cash balance and excess availability requirements  minimum tangible net worth and ebitda covenants  and limitations on liens and certain additional indebtedness and guarantees 
the covenants are written such that as long as we maintain the minimum cash balance and excess availability requirement  the other covenants are not required to be met 
as of september   we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility since cash on deposit and excess availability exceeded the million financial covenant 
our credit facility also contains certain events of default  including a subjective acceleration clause 
under this clause  wells fargo may declare an event of default if it believes in good faith that our ability to pay all or any portion of our indebtedness with wells fargo or to perform any of our material obligations under the credit facility has been impaired  or if it believes in good faith that there has been a material adverse change in the business or financial condition of the company 
if an event of default is not cured within the grace period if applicable  then wells fargo may  among other things  accelerate repayment of amounts borrowed under the credit facility  cease making advances under the credit facility  or take possession of the company s assets that secure its obligations under the credit facility 
we do not anticipate at this time any change in the business or financial condition of the company that could be deemed a material adverse change by wells fargo 
wells fargo has confirmed that they do not consider the flooding at our contract manufacturer s facility in thailand in to be a material adverse change in the business or financial condition of the company 
on december   we entered into a first amendment to the credit facility which increased our eligible borrowing base by up to million by adding to the borrowing base formula of the appraised value of the company s equipment and of the appraised value of the company s real estate 
in addition  wells fargo reduced our restrictions under the excess availability financial covenant requirement from million to million through december the interest rate on outstanding borrowings was increased to libor rate plus four percent 
the credit facility will return to its previous agreement terms on the earlier of i december   or ii the date that we receive insurance proceeds of not less than million in the aggregate applicable to the flooding of our primary contract manufacturer in thailand 
on june   we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility  which amended among other things  the borrowing base increase under the first amendment  which is subject to automatic reductions to i million on july   and to ii million on january  the second amendment automatically reduces the million and million thresholds referenced above to million and  respectively  if the sale of certain assets does not occur 
the amended credit facility no longer includes certain assets in the potential borrowing base including certain machinery and equipment and real estate 

table of contents as of september   we had a million libor rate loan outstanding under our credit facility  with an interest rate of 
as of november   the outstanding balance under this credit facility totaled approximately million 
as of september   the credit facility also had million reserved for eight outstanding stand by letters of credit  leaving a remaining million borrowing availability balance under this credit facility 
we now expect at least of the million credit facility to be available for use over the next year 
october stock sale on october  we sold to an underwriter  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 

see note subsequent event for additional disclosures related to the stock sale 
equity facility in august  we entered into a committed equity line financing facility equity facility with commerce court small cap value fund  ltd 
commerce court whereby commerce court has committed  upon issuance of a draw down request by us  to purchase up to million worth of our common stock over a two year period  subject to our common stock trading above per share  as adjusted for the reverse stock split  during the draw down period  unless a waiver is received 
as of september   there have been no draw down transactions completed under this equity facility 
impact from thailand flood in november  we entered into an agreement with our contract manufacturer in thailand whereby they agreed to purchase equipment to rebuild certain manufacturing lines damaged by flood waters and we agreed to reimburse them for the cost of the equipment out of insurance proceeds that we expect to receive 
we were not a named beneficiary of our contract manufacturer s insurance policy 
during the fiscal year ended september   we capitalized the cost of our new manufacturing lines of approximately million and recorded an equipment capital lease obligation of million  net of equipment deposits 
additionally  we restructured our outstanding payables owed to our contract manufacturer  which delayed payments to future dates to coincide with expected timing of insurance proceeds 
in september  we received flood recoveries of million 
we expect to receive an additional million in cash proceeds as well as liability offsets of approximately million by march  to cover the direct damages to our assets that were impacted by the flood 
flood recoveries related to inventory and equipment destroyed by the thailand flood will be recognized when they become realized 
see 
note impact from thailand flood for additional disclosures related to the impact of the thailand flood on our operations 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  the agreement with our contract manufacturer to delay payment terms and purchase equipment on our behalf  benefits expected from insurance proceeds  and amounts expected to be available under our credit and equity facilities will provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our cash requirements for operations  working capital  and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  in the event of unforeseen circumstances  unfavorable market or economic developments  unfavorable results from operations  any failure to receive expected proceeds from insurance  material claims made under the indemnification provisions of our master purchase agreement with sei  or if wells fargo declares an event of default on the credit facility  we may have to raise additional funds or reduce expenditures by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity  debt or convertible debt  selling certain product lines and or portions of our business  furloughs  or reduction of discretionary spending 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
a significant contraction in the capital markets  particularly in the technology sector  may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital if or when it is required  especially if we experience negative operating results 
if adequate capital is not available to us as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows may be adversely affected

our inventory balances have fluctuated historically due to the timing of customer orders and product shipments  changes in our internal forecasts related to customer demand  as well as adjustments related to excess and obsolete inventory 
accounts payable the fluctuation of our accounts payable balances is primarily driven by changes in inventory purchases as well as changes related to the timing of actual payments to vendors 
accrued expenses our largest accrued expense typically relates to compensation 
historically  fluctuations of our accrued expense accounts have primarily related to changes in the timing of actual compensation payments  receipt or application of advanced payments  adjustments to our warranty accrual  and accruals related to professional fees

in november  we entered into an agreement with our contract manufacturer that was affected by the floods in thailand whereby our contract manufacturer will purchase equipment to rebuild our affected manufacturing lines

the fair value was estimated by discounting projected cash flows over the estimated life of the related assets using credit adjusted risk free rates which ranged from to 
the asset retirement obligations in the table above includes assumptions related to renewal option periods where we expect to extend facility lease terms 
in future periods  the asset retirement obligation is accreted for the change in its present value and capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the related assets 
if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes  an adjustment will be recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement capitalized cost 
revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates  escalating retirement costs  and changes in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange risks the united states dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated financial statements 
the functional currency of our spanish subsidiary is the euro 
the functional currency for our china subsidiary is the yuan renminbi 
we recognize gains and losses due to the effect of exchange rate changes on foreign currency primarily due to our operations in spain  the netherlands  and in china 
the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into us dollars at the rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet dates  and the revenue and expense amounts are translated at the average rate during the applicable periods reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  both realized and unrealized  are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
a majority of the gain or losses recorded relates to the change in value of the euro and yuan renminbi relative to the us dollar 
during the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro 
to reduce the impact of these risks on our earnings and to increase the predictability of cash flows  we use natural offsets in receipts and disbursements within the applicable currency as the primary means of reducing the risk 
some of our foreign suppliers may adjust their prices in us from time to time to reflect currency exchange fluctuations  and such price changes could impact our future financial condition or results of operations 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure 
interest rate risks on november   we entered into a credit and security agreement credit facility with wells fargo bank 
the credit facility provides us with a three year revolving credit of up to million that can be used for working capital requirements  letters of credit  and other general corporate purposes

the amended credit facility no longer includes certain assets in the potential borrowing base including certain machinery and equipment and real estate 
inflation risks inflationary factors  such as increases in material costs and operating expenses  may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  an increase in the rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse affect on the levels of gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue if the sales prices for our products do not proportionately increase with these increases expenses 

table of contents credit market conditions recently  the us and global capital markets have been experiencing turbulent conditions  particularly in the credit markets  as evidenced by tightening of lending standards  reduced availability of credit  and reductions in certain asset values
