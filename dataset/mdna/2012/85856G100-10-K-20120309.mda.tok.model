item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
utilizing a super community banking strategy  the subsidiary bank is run autonomously as a community bank 
at december   we had consolidated total assets of billion and were one of the largest independent bank holding companies headquartered in the commonwealth of virginia 
our deposit market share at june  represented approximately of the total banking deposits in the commonwealth of virginia 
our operating strategy is to generate interest income  fees and other revenue growth through business lines that emphasize higher yielding assets funded by core deposits 
this strategy includes partnering with clients while providing excellent service through branches that are open six days a week  atm networks and telephone and internet banking 
our growth strategies include new branch expansion  acquisitions and the development of new products and services 
new products and services are designed to build on existing businesses and expand into complementary products and services through strategic initiatives 
our lending strategy is to originate high credit quality  primarily secured and owner occupied  loans 
the largest core lending business is our commercial and consumer real estate loan operation  which offers variable rate loans and lines of credit secured by real estate properties 
these loans are generally made on local properties or to local customers within our markets 
construction and land development 
these loans are made primarily to community developers 
they are underwritten with an emphasis on the viability of the development  with particular focus on the borrower s ability to meet certain minimum debt service requirements 
commercial real estate loans 
these loans are tied primarily to either multi family income producing properties  commercial income producing properties where repayment of the loan is dependent upon a rd party lease or commercial real estate associated with operating companies where there is no dependence upon repayment from a rd party lease 
consumer real estate loans 
we originate adjustable and fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
these mortgage loans are generally originated under terms and conditions consistent with secondary market guidelines 
we place some of these loans in our loan portfolio  however  a majority is sold to the secondary mortgage market 
the consumer real estate loans that are included in our loan portfolio are usually owner occupied and generally amortized over a to year period with three to five year maturity or re pricing 
commercial and industrial loans 
general commercial and industrial loans consist of loans made primarily to manufacturers  wholesalers and retailers of goods  service companies and other industries 
these loans are made for acquisition  expansion and working capital purposes  and may be secured by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  personal guarantees or other assets 
we monitor these loans by requesting submission of corporate and personal financial statements and income tax returns 
we have also generated loans that are guaranteed by the sba 
sba loans are generally underwritten in the same manner as conventional loans generated for our portfolio 
we believe that making such loans helps the local community and also provides us with a source of income and solid future lending relationships as those businesses grow and prosper 
the primary repayment risk for commercial loans is the failure of the business due to economic or financial factors 
consumer and other loans 
consumer loans include motor vehicle  home improvement  home equity and small personal credit lines 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of the loan 
these loans are generally secured by various assets owned by the consumer 
stellarone bank owns a interest in banker s insurance  llc and a interest in virginia title center  llc 
bankers insurance  llc is a full service  independent insurance agency headquartered in richmond  virginia that was established in through partnerships with many of the major insurance companies  bankers insurance  llc is able to offer complete insurance packages  whether commercial  personal  or life and health  at competitive prices 
based in roanoke  virginia  virginia title center  llc has been providing title insurance products and related services in virginia  tennessee  north carolina  south carolina  and west virginia since virginia title center  llc underwrites through investors title insurance company headquartered in chapel hill  north carolina 
investors title insurance company is recognized nationally for its innovative products  flexible underwriting  and competitive pricing 

table of contents employees at december   we had full time equivalent employees 
no employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit 
management considers relations with its employees to be good 
competition we face strong competition in each of our primary markets from large regional and national financial institutions  savings and loans  credit unions and other community banking organizations 
in addition  consumer finance companies  asset managers and mortgage companies all provide competition 
out of state bank holding companies are providing increased competition through merger with  and acquisition of  virginia banks 
competition for deposits is influenced by rates paid  customer loyalty factors  product offerings and convenience of branch network 
the competition in the industry has also increased as a result of the passage of the act  which drew new lines between the types of activities that are financial in nature and permitted for banking organizations  and those activities that are commercial in nature and not permitted 
the act imposes community reinvestment requirements on financial service organizations that seek to qualify for the expanded powers to engage in broader financial activities and affiliations with financial companies that are permitted 
the act created a new form of financial organization called a financial holding company  which may own banks  insurance companies and securities firms 
a financial holding company is authorized to engage in any activity that is financial in nature  incidental to an activity that is financial in nature  or is a complimentary activity 
these activities may include insurance  securities transactions  and traditional banking related activities 
the act establishes a consultative and cooperative procedure between the federal reserve and the secretary of the treasury for purposes of determination as to the scope of activities permitted by the act 
we did not elect to be treated as a financial holding company 
no material part of the business of the subsidiary bank is dependent upon a single or a few customers and the loss of one or more customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon the business of the bank 
we are not aware of any indications that the business of the bank or material portion thereof is  or may be  seasonal 

table of contents regulation  supervision and government policy we are extensively regulated under federal and state law 
generally  these laws and regulations are intended to protect depositors and not shareholders 
the description below summarizes the current regulatory structure in which we operate 
the regulatory structure can change  and if changed  could have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event the regulatory structure changes significantly  our structure and the products and services we offer could also change significantly as a result 
the dodd frank act on july   financial regulatory reform legislation under the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  responsible for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws 
smaller financial institutions  including stellarone  continue to be subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws 
apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank holding companies 
require the fdic to seek to make its capital requirements for banks countercyclical so that the amount of capital required to be maintained increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction 
require holding companies  such as stellarone corporation  to be well capitalized and well managed as of july  we have met the requirement for well capitalized and well managed as of the most recent reporting date 
made permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance and provides unlimited federal deposit insurance until january  for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions 
implement corporate governance revisions  including executive compensation and proxy access by stockholders 
change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  eliminate the ceiling on the size of the dif and increase the floor of the dif 
many aspects of the dodd frank act still remain subject to rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us  our customers or the financial industry more generally 

table of contents bank holding company we are registered as a bank holding company under the bhca  as amended  and are subject to supervision and regulation by the frb and the scc 
as a bank holding company  we are required to furnish to the frb an annual report of our operations at the end of each fiscal year and to furnish such additional information as the frb may require pursuant to the bhca 
the frb and scc conduct examinations of the company on an alternate year basis 
the bhca requires prior approval of the frb before a bank holding company can acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of another bank  or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company 
under the bhca  a bank holding company is prohibited  with limited exceptions  from engaging  directly or indirectly  in any business unrelated to the businesses of banking or managing and controlling banks 
bank holding companies wishing to participate in an expanded list of financial activities must file an election with the frb to be treated as a financial holding company 
we have filed no such election  nor do we plan to in the future 
under the frb policy  we are expected to act as a source of financial strength for our banking subsidiary and to commit support to it 
this support may be required at times when  absent such policy  we may not otherwise provide such support 
capital purchase program on december   as part of the cpp established by the treasury under the eesa  we entered into a purchase agreement with the treasury pursuant to which we issued and sold to the treasury  shares of our the series a preferred stock  and a ten year warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at an initial exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
cumulative dividends on the series a preferred stock accrue on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum for the first five years  and at a rate of per annum thereafter 
the series a preferred stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to our common stock and pari passu with our other authorized series of preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution  and winding up of the company 
the series a preferred stock generally is non voting 
the arra amends certain provisions of eesa and includes a provision that  subject to consultation with the appropriate federal banking agency  directs the treasury to permit financial institutions from whom the treasury purchased preferred stock to redeem such preferred stock at par upon approval by its primary regulator 
on april   we redeemed  or  shares  of our preferred stock 
we repurchased the preferred stock for million that had a current carrying value of million  net of thousand unaccreted discount  on the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the repurchase  we accelerated the accretion of the thousand discount and recorded a total reduction in shareholders equity of million 
on december   we completed our repurchase of the preferred stock by redeeming the remaining  shares 
the remaining shares had a carrying value of million  net of thousand unaccreted discount 
we accelerated the accretion of the thousand discount and recorded a total reduction in shareholders equity of million 
the  common stock warrants issued at the inception of the cpp expire december  and remain outstanding 
while subject to tarp  we were in compliance with all executive compensation and corporate governance requirements issued by treasury 

table of contents capital requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators which  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets  and of tier capital to average assets 
as of december   we met all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject  both on a consolidated and subsidiary bank basis 
the most recent notification from the federal reserve bank of richmond categorized the subsidiary bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under the federal deposit insurance act of to be categorized as well capitalized  we must maintain minimum total risk based  tier risk based  and tier leverage ratios 
there are no conditions or events since notification that management believes have changed our category 
dividends it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only from income available as defined  and only from prospective earnings retention consistent with the expected future needs and financial condition of the organization 
the policy provides that the bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the ability to serve as a source of strength to the banking subsidiary 
we are a bank holding company separate and apart from our subsidiary  and thus have liquidity needs that are funded primarily by the income of our subsidiary 
the holding company s cash outflows consist of dividends to shareholders  interest on borrowings and unallocated corporate expenses 
the main sources of funding for the holding company are the management fees and dividends we receive from the banking subsidiary 
under the current supervisory regulation  prior approval from certain agencies is required if the subsidiary bank pays cash dividends that exceed certain levels as defined 
during  the banking subsidiary paid million in management fees and million in dividends to the holding company 
the large dividend payment arose due to the million tarp repayment  which when initiated  was a capital contribution from the parent to the bank subsidiary and was repaid to the parent upon exit from the program 
usa patriot act the subsidiary bank is subject to the requirements of the patriot act  which provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering 
the patriot act places a significantly increased reporting responsibility and regulatory oversight on financial institutions to share information with the federal government concerning activities that may involve money laundering or terrorist activities 
the patriot act is considered a significant banking law in terms of information disclosure regarding certain customer transactions 
certain provisions of the patriot act impose the obligation to establish anti money laundering programs  including the development of a customer identification program  and the screening of all customers against any government lists of known or suspected terrorists 
we are in compliance with the requirements of the patriot act 

table of contents deposit insurance premiums the fdic maintains a risk based assessment system for determining deposit insurance premiums 
four risk categories i iv  each subject to different premium rates  are established  based upon an institution s status as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized  and the institution s supervisory rating 
the levels of rates are subject to periodic adjustment by the fdic 
as of december   we were evaluated as a risk category i institution 
dodd frank permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  and extended unlimited deposit insurance to non interest bearing transaction accounts through december  dodd frank also broadened the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments are now based on a financial institution s average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital 
dodd frank requires the fdic to increase the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund from to of insured deposits by and eliminates the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
dodd frank eliminated the statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts  effective in july there are three adjustments that can be made to an institution s initial base assessment rate a potential decrease for long term unsecured debt  including senior and subordinated debt and  for small institutions  a portion of tier capital  a potential increase for secured liabilities above a threshold amount  and for non risk category i institutions  a potential increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount 
the current schedule for base assessment rates and potential adjustment is set forth in the following table 
risk category large and highly complex i ii iii iv institutions initial base assessment rate to to plus unsecured debt adjustment to to to to to brokered deposit adjustment n a to to to to total base assessment rate to to to to to on november   the fdic adopted a final rule requiring depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly insurance premium for fourth quarter and all of  and on december   we pre paid estimated assessments of million for the years and million remained as a prepaid balance at december  the expense related to this prepayment is anticipated to be recognized over the next year based on actual calculations of quarterly premiums 
fdic insurance expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
fdic insurance expense includes deposit insurance assessments and fico assessments related to outstanding fico bonds 
the fico is a mixed ownership government corporation established by the competitive equality banking act of whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct federal savings loan insurance corporation 

table of contents incentive compensation in june  the federal reserve  occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the guidance  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 
the federal reserve will review  as part of the regular  risk focused examination process  the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations  such as stellarone  that are not large  complex banking organizations 
these reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements 
the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination 
deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings  which can affect the organization s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions 
enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements  or related risk management control or governance processes  pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
at december   we had not been made aware of any instances of non compliance with the new guidance 
community reinvestment act the subsidiary bank is subject to the requirements of the cra 
the cra imposes an affirmative and ongoing obligation on financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
if the bank subsidiary receives a rating from the federal reserve of less than satisfactory under the cra  restrictions on operating activities would be imposed 
the subsidiary bank currently has a satisfactory cra rating 
privacy legislation several regulations issued by federal banking agencies also provide protections against the transfer and use of customer information by financial institutions 
a financial institution must provide information to its customers regarding its policies and procedures with respect to the handling of customers personal information 
each institution must conduct an internal risk assessment of its ability to protect customer information 
these privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer s personal financial information to unaffiliated parties without prior notice and approval from the customer 
consumer laws and regulations the subsidiary bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  real estate settlement procedures act  home mortgage disclosure act  the fair credit reporting act and the fair housing act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions transact business with customers 
the subsidiary bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations

table of contents item a 
risk factors in the normal course of business  we are exposed to various risks 
management balances our strategic goals  including revenue and profitability objectives  with the associated risks 
this section highlights specific risks that could affect our company and our business 
although current key factors are discussed  please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future 
new risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance 
this listing should not be considered all inclusive 
if any of the following risks were to occur  we may not be able to conduct business as currently planned and financial condition or operating results could be negatively impacted 
these matters could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline in future periods 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected the banking industry 
the us economy was in recession from december through june business activity across a broad range of industries and regions in the u 
s 
was greatly reduced 
although economic conditions have begun to improve  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
local governments and many businesses are still struggling with lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
market conditions also played a role in the failure or merger of several prominent financial institutions and numerous regional and community based financial institutions 
these failures  as well as projected future failures  have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization level of the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  which in turn  has led to a significant increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions 
our general financial performance is dependent upon certain factors within the business environment in the markets where we operate  in the commonwealth of virginia and in the united states  including the ability of borrowers to pay interest on outstanding loans the ability of borrowers to repay principal on outstanding loans the value of collateral securing loans the demand for loans and other products and services we offer 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  low unemployment  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  high unemployment  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
overall  during  the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
while economic conditions in the commonwealth of virginia  the united states and worldwide have begun to improve  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue 
these conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we are subject to credit risk 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across the commonwealth of virginia and the united states 
increases in interest rates and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil monetary penalties against us 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate mortgage loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans 
these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 
because our loan portfolio contains commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large individual balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal open market committee 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments  to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if the allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate  results of operations may be adversely affected 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb estimated incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio  management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering current general market conditions  credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of customers relative to their financial obligations 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control and these losses may cause the loan loss provision to vary widely from recent levels 
although management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio  it is an estimate subject to revision as losses are confirmed 
higher levels of loan losses in the future could have a material adverse impact on financial performance 
federal and state regulators  as an integral part of their supervisory function  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these regulatory agencies may require us to increase the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs based upon their judgments  which may be different from management s 
any increase in the allowance for loan losses required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the markets in which it operates 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in northern  central and western virginia 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our business  real estate and construction loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities  unemployment or other factors beyond our control  could impact these local economic conditions and could result in  among other things  a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit  including a resultant effect on the loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not security holders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy  and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations  and policies for possible changes 
under the dodd frank act  the federal reserve  using a phased in approach between and  will no longer include trust preferred and certain other hybrid debt securities in tier capital 
the eventual decrease of tier capital  and actions to replace such capital may adversely affect us 
although we are not currently directly affected by basel iii  management does expect some trickle down effect in the future concerning liquidity tests 
other recently enacted  proposed and future changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes  which are beyond our control  could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on earnings 
the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the us its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments  both of which affect the net interest margin 
its policies can also adversely affect borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
changes in federal reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict  consequently  the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict 

table of contents future growth may require the need for additional capital and further regulatory approvals which  if not obtained  could adversely impact profitability and implementation of current strategic initiatives 
to ensure continued growth  we will need to provide sufficient capital through earnings generation  additional equity or trust preferred offerings or borrowed funds  or any combination of these funding sources 
for certain amounts or types of indebtedness  we may be required to obtain certain regulatory approvals beforehand 
the ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on our financial performance  as well as conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control 
financial and credit markets have experienced unprecedented disruption and volatility during the past several years 
while market conditions have stabilized and  in many cases  improved  a disruption in  or worsening of  financial and credit market conditions  or increased volatility in financial and credit markets  may adversely affect our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms and could negatively affect liquidity 
we may raise additional capital through the issuance of common stock  which could dilute existing earnings per share  or further reduce or even eliminate the common stock dividend to preserve capital or in order to raise additional capital 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand and grow operations and attain long term profitability goals could be materially impacted 
our subsidiary bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which  to the extent we require such dividends in the future  may affect our ability to pay obligations and dividends 
we are a separate legal entity from the subsidiary bank  and thus do not have significant revenue sources of our own 
we currently depend on the subsidiary bank s cash and liquidity as well as dividends from the banking subsidiary to pay operating expenses and dividends to shareholders 
no assurance can be made that in the future the subsidiary bank will have the capacity to pay the necessary dividends or that we will not require dividends from the subsidiary bank to satisfy our obligations 
the availability of dividends from the subsidiary bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
depending upon our financial condition and other factors  it is possible that the federal reserve board could limit the payment of dividends or other payments by the subsidiary bank 
in the event the subsidiary bank is unable to pay dividends sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may not be able to service our obligations as they become due or pay dividends on our common stock 
consequently  the inability to receive dividends from the subsidiary bank could adversely affect financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses due to a concentration in loans secured by real estate 
we offer a variety of secured loans  including commercial lines of credit  commercial term loans  real estate  construction  home equity  consumer and other loans 
credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers who  as a group  may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions 
currently  many loans are secured by real estate both residential and commercial in our market area 
at december   approximately and of the billion loans receivable portfolio were secured by commercial and residential real estate  respectively 
continued pressures on the real estate markets  such as deterioration in the value of this collateral and the current recession in national and local economies  could adversely affect customers ability to pay these loans  which in turn could impact the company 
risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry  and we try to limit exposure to this risk by monitoring extensions of credit carefully 
we cannot fully eliminate credit risk  and as a result credit losses may occur in the future 

table of contents the value of goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future 
as of december   we had million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate  slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues 
as a community based financial institution  earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion 
negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  the failure of any product or service sold to meet the clients expectations or applicable regulatory requirements  corporate governance and acquisitions  or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities 
negative public opinion can adversely affect the ability to attract and or retain clients and personnel and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
actual or alleged conduct by one of the business lines can result in negative public opinion about the other business lines 
we depend on the services of key personnel  and a loss of any of those personnel may disrupt operations and result in reduced revenues 
our success depends upon the continued service of the senior management team and upon our ability to attract and retain qualified financial services personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense 
in our experience  it can take a significant period of time to identify and hire personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required in carrying out strategy 
if we lose the services of key personnel  or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
while our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq stock market s global select market  it has less liquidity than stocks for larger companies quoted on a national securities exchange 
the trading volume in our common stock on the nasdaq global select market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the nasdaq global select market or other stock exchanges 
although we have experienced increased liquidity in the stock  we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop 
because of this  it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock in the market  or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market  will have on the market price of the common stock 
we can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market  or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market  would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of its common stock 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly  and may fluctuate in the future 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on asset prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
general market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock  and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices 

table of contents maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards 
there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices 
this can reduce net interest margin and noninterest income from fee based products and services 
we may not be successful introducing new products and services in response to industry trends  or those new products may not achieve market acceptance 
as a result  we could lose business or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients 
we are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business 
security breaches in our internet banking activities could expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation 
any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information 
we rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data 
these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures that could result in damage to our reputation and our business 
while most of our core data processing is conducted internally  certain key applications are outsourced to third party providers 
if our third party providers encounter difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third parties  it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions  which would significantly affect our business operations 
to address these risks  we employ the following strategies regular penetration testing of our network perimeter regular employee training programs around sound security practices deployment of tools to monitor the bank s network including intrusion prevention and detection systems  electronic mail spam filters  anti virus and anti malware  resource logging and patch management the implementation of multifactor authentication for customers using internet banking and treasury management tools the development of security policies and procedures for the addition and maintenance of user access and rights to resources 
our business is technology dependent  and an inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services  which may require substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services 
in addition to better customer service  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and results in reduced costs 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to create synergies in our operations through the use of technology  particularly in light of our past and projected growth strategy 
many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we cannot make assurances that technological improvements will increase operational efficiency or that it will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions  which could affect costs and from which anticipated benefits may not be fully realized 
acquisition opportunities will continue to be part of our growth strategy 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates  negotiate appropriate acquisition terms  complete proposed acquisitions  successfully integrate acquired businesses into the existing operations  or expand into new markets 
once integrated  acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues  profitability  or productivity comparable with those achieved in existing operations  or otherwise perform as expected 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies  services and products of the acquired companies  and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
management may not properly ascertain all such risks prior to an acquisition or prior to such a risk impacting our business while integrating an acquired company 
as a result  difficulties encountered with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  and results of operations 
furthermore  we must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can begin to acquire a bank or bank holding company 
in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition  federal bank regulators will consider  among other factors  the effect of the acquisition on competition  financial condition  future prospects  including current and projected capital levels  the competence  experience  and integrity of management  compliance with laws and regulations  the convenience and needs of the communities to be served  including the acquiring institution s record of compliance under the cra  and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities 
in addition  we cannot be certain when  or if  or on what terms and conditions  any required regulatory approvals will be granted 
consequently  we may not obtain regulatory approval for a proposed acquisition  in which case the acquisition could not be completed despite the time and expenses invested in pursuing it 
we could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions  which could dilute stockholder ownership 
our operations rely on certain external vendors 
we are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day to day operations 
accordingly  operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements 
we maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including  among other things  i changes in the vendor s organizational structure  ii changes in the vendor s financial condition  iii changes in the vendor s support for existing products and services and iv changes in the vendor s strategic focus 
while we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk  the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations  which could have a material adverse impact on the business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
executive overview the slowly improving economic environment during positively impacted our financial performance compared to the prior year as we realized net income of million and net income available to common shareholders of million  or per common share  compared to net income of million  or per common share in key factors affecting full year results included expansion of net interest margin  decrease in non performing assets as a percentage of total assets  decreased charge offs and decreased losses from mortgage indemnifications  offset by slightly decreased operating results from the retail banking line of business 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for  a decrease of million compared to the million recorded in the provision compares to net charge offs of million for the year 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans decreased from at december  to at december   reflecting our continuing focus on resolving problem credits in the loan portfolio 
while it is difficult to predict the impact or length of the recessionary economy  we anticipate continued improvement to the elevated levels of non performing assets and net charge offs in we fully exited the tarp program in late this was accomplished with no dilution to our common shareholders 
despite the challenging economic environment  we continue to operate in a position of strength and are focused on expanding revenue  building efficiencies  increasing the profitability of the balance sheet  investing for the future  and prudently managing credit 
to this end  we remain acutely focused on clients  improving service quality and front line execution  controlling expenses  and managing risk 
during the year  loan demand was down  credit costs and asset quality continued to be challenging 
continued economic weakness suppressed demand for loans as customers attempt to reduce debt and preserve capital 
however  we also experienced margin expansion through disciplined deposit pricing  reduced provision for loan losses and credit trends that improved during management believes the strong capital position coupled with client focused execution  will enable us to implement a leveraging strategy by seeking organic growth and acquisition partners in higher growth markets when the economic climate improves 
our commercial bank segment recorded banking fee income of million for  a decrease of thousand or compared to million for this sequential year decrease was attributable to a decrease of million in consumer overdraft fees  which resulted from implementing the modifications to regulation e that became effective during late and was partially offset by an increase in interchange fee income of thousand 
tax equivalent interest income for this segment increased million or to million in this was driven by a basis point increase in net interest margin to in the segment recorded a provision for loan losses of million for  a decrease of million compared to the million recorded in income from this business segment totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  revenues from the mortgage banking segment totaled million for the year ended december   or down million or compared to million for the year ended december  mortgage revenues for were decreased by thousand in indemnification losses recognized  which compares to million for net income from this business segment totaled thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the wealth management segment realized income of thousand during  a decrease of thousand or compared to thousand during revenues from trust and brokerage fees for were million or up thousand or when compared to million realized during higher fee realizations and increased assets under management attributed to the revenue increase 
fiduciary and brokerage assets decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  
table of contents results of operations net interest income the primary source of our traditional banking revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets 
earning assets include loans  securities  and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowings 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
earning assets obtained through noninterest bearing sources of funds such as regular demand deposits and stockholders equity result in a net interest margin that is higher than the interest rate spread 
compared to tax equivalent net interest income in was million  an increase of million or compared to million in average interest earning assets decreased million or to billion  while average loans decreased million or to billion

table of contents asset liability management asset liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring and management of interest rate risk  market risk  liquidity and funding 
alco oversees these risks and reports periodically to the board 
alco is a management committee and consists of senior financial and business executives 
the credit and enterprise risk committee is a board committee that meets monthly 
its main objective is to discuss the strategic and emerging risks that the company faces  including risk policy review and approval  and compliance reporting 
the credit and enterprise risk committee also reviews the alco reporting and minutes to stay abreast of interest rate  market and liquidity risks  and discussions 
interest rate risk and sensitivity financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks that may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
we do not currently have any exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity market price risk 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  we derive a significant amount of operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in our future earnings earnings at risk and value economic value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that re price within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment and contractual interest rate changes 
the primary objective of our asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate  yet if not properly managed can be detrimental to our long term profitability 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at an appropriate level 
we assume interest rate risk the risk that general interest rate levels will change as a result of our normal operations 
as a result  the fair values of our financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable 
management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk 
however  borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment 
conversely  depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment 
management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate our overall interest rate risk 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
alco is responsible for these decisions 
the committee operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of acceptable risk 
these policies are approved by the board of directors 
we primarily use the securities portfolios and fhlb advances to manage our interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or re pricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
we use simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and eve analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of our interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and re pricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other imbedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of our interest rate risk position over time 

table of contents earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of our shorter term interest rate risk 
the analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach 
the measurement date balance sheet composition or mix is maintained over the simulation time period with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
rate changes are varied to assess volatility under different yield curve assumptions 
the base net interest income simulation performed as of december   assumes interest rates are unchanged for the next months 
the simulation then assumes that rates are shocked up and down by basis points in basis point increments 
given the absolute low level of interest rates  we have temporarily suspended analyses that assume rates move down by more than basis points 
the simulation analysis results are presented in the table below 
these results indicate that we would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and to decrease by if rates shifted downward by basis points 
management also evaluates the impact on net interest income assuming a most likely rate scenario utilizing a rate forecast published by global insight and balance sheet growth projections provided by management 
under this scenario net interest income is anticipated to increase over the next twelve months by 
these profiles reflect a moderate interest rate risk position and are well within the guidelines set by policy 
table earnings at risk simulation results change in net interest income percentage amount change in yield curve in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points base case basis points most likely rate scenario economic value of equity market risk the eve analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the eve of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of expected liability cash flows 
the economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to determine the expected cash flows in various rate scenarios 
the resulting percentage change in eve is an indication of the longer term re pricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the eve analysis results are presented in the table below 
these results as of december  indicate that the eve would increase assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and decrease if rates shifted downward by basis points 
our risk position is outside the guidelines set by policy of negative in the down basis points scenario  but is considered manageable 
this is attributable to the absolute low level of rates in the current economic cycle and floors being reached on assets as deposits continue to re price down  which negatively impacts economic value

table of contents noninterest expense the following table presents the components of noninterest expense and the variance or percentage change 
table and noninterest expense in thousands compensation and employee benefits net occupancy equipment amortization intangible assets marketing state franchise taxes fdic insurance data processing professional fees telecommunications other operating expense compensation and employee benefits increased due to our efforts to enhance human capital in key senior management and line positions over the past eighteen months and the reestablishment of incentive plans for revenue producing units 
the increase in equipment is due to our continued focus on technology within our business 
during  we implemented new software in the human resources department and enhanced technology within our retail line of business 
in addition  we continue to focus on technology penetration with our customers through online banking initiatives 
in january  the fdic began assessing rates on total assets less tangible equity and migrated away from their previous methodology  which assessed rates on deposit liabilities 
due to our high capital levels and low reliance on wholesale funding  our fdic insurance fee assessment rates decreased during  and no special assessments were made 
we expect the assessment rate in to remain consistent with levels 
the decrease in other operating expense is due to the decrease in loan originations  resulting in a decrease of million in origination expenses 
this decrease was offset by increases of thousand in credit investigation during the loan origination process and thousand in additional costs associated with temporary employment as we filled positions during peak business times

the tax preference items such as tax exempt interest income and earnings on boli were comparable between and pretax earnings increased in relative to the level of tax preference items resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate over the prior year 
the effective tax rate remains suppressed on a historical basis  but began to normalize somewhat in as our earnings increased compared to the prior year 
the increase in the effective rate when comparing to is primarily due to the loss recognized in the tax preference items such as tax exempt interest income and earnings on boli are comparable between each year  however  in a loss year these differences have the effect of increasing the tax benefit rate and reducing the effective tax rate when applied to pretax earnings 
the effective tax rate on a historical basis remained suppressed in due to lower than normal pretax earnings

national and local housing trends were documented as materially deteriorating during and continued through as a part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  we monitor the number of building permits issued  median home sales prices  new homes in inventory  number of days on market  housing affordability  elevated levels of foreclosure activity  new mortgage originations and foreclosed asset levels 
these metrics continue to indicate that a general cyclical weakness remains in our residential markets  and we do not expect the trend to reverse substantially in we have consciously and consistently reduced our exposure to this loan class by million or  from million to million at december  and  respectively 
continued risk associated with commercial real estate loans 
we had million of commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  of the million  million is tied to multi family secured income producing loans and million is associated with commercial real estate 
due to the continued adverse impact to vacancy and lease rates due to the weakened economic environment  reduced consumer confidence levels and increased retail business failures  management perceives continued additional inherent risk associated with this category of loans in and has maintained a similar reserve level to that noted in decrease in specific reserves on commercial and industrial loans 
in  we had a million reserve on a commercial loan  which was fully resolved in the decrease in the allowance in this category is attributable to the removal of this reserve  as well as a decrease in net charge offs from to our allowance methodology places a higher emphasis on the prior twelve month charge off history  decreasing our allocation of loan losses in this category 
though still elevated  levels of classified loans began decreasing from prior elevated levels 
the level of classified loans began decreasing in  positively impacting the level of allocations required based upon historical loss experience and resulting in moderate provision release after three years of increased provisioning and allowance levels 
specific reserves remain elevated over this same time period amounting to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
net charge offs decreased compared to and  but remained historically elevated 
management was able to begin slightly lower charge off factors when considering the losses currently inherent in the loan portfolio during the calculation of the allowance for loan losses due to the reduced levels of charge offs experienced in less than full employment levels in the commonwealth of virginia 
unemployment in our geographic footprint is approximately which is above the ideal full employment level defined by the commonwealth as an unemployment level of 
this unemployment level negatively impacts the ability of consumers within our footprint to curtail their debts and purchase goods and services 
this general reduction in cash flow has a negative impact on all loan categories within the portfolio  although is slowly improving from prior years 
improvement in overall risk of loan portfolio 
we have continued to aggressively work through our asset quality issues encountered as a result of the economic environment of the past few years 
special mention assets  which are those risk graded or above  have decreased million  or from we expect to continue this decreasing trend as we monitor those special mention assets still in the portfolio  as well as continue our stringent lending requirements 
the loan portfolio mix indicates a shift away from construction and land development and commercial real estate and an increase in the consumer real estate and commercial and industrial categories 
the declining risks within the portfolio due to macroeconomic factors are reflected in lower provisioning throughout almost all loan segments 
the allocations within the portfolio remain relatively stable year over year 

table of contents non performing assets consist of our non accrual loans  non performing troubled debt restructurings  and other property owned 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when the collection of principal and interest is ninety days or more past due  or earlier  if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower 
as of december   we are not aware of any material performing loans with indications of possible credit problems that should be moved to non accrual status 
for those loans that are carried on non accrual status  interest is generally recognized on a cash basis 
the following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of non performing assets

no interest income on nonaccrual and non performing troubled debt restructurings was included in net income for any of the five years ended december  impaired loans totaled million at december  this total includes million individually evaluated for impairment and million of impaired loans that were collectively evaluated for impairment 
interest is not typically accrued on impaired loans  however  all loans classified as tdrs are considered impaired 
at december   we had million in loans under tdrs and million of these restructurings were accruing interest 
interest income recognized on these tdrs was thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a cash basis  interest recognized on these tdrs was thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other than these consumer real estate loans designated as tdrs  no interest income has been recognized on impaired loans subsequent to their classification as impaired for the years ended december   and we collectively evaluate smaller balance homogenous loans for impairment  unless such loans are subject to a restructuring agreement 
collectively evaluated nonaccrual loans excluded from the impaired loan disclosure amounted to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
at december   total non performing assets totaled million  a decrease of million from nonperforming assets remain at historically elevated levels and reflect the continuing challenges in the residential housing market and persisting credit quality issues in acquisition and development construction credits  commercial real estate credits and real estate mortgage loans 
the decrease in the level of non performing assets is a result of continued efforts to accelerate the identification and resolution of problem credits by our special assets group 
this is also illustrated by increased proceeds from the sale of foreclosed assets of million in which compares to proceeds of million in at december   total non performing assets totaled million  a decrease of million from nonperforming assets were at historically elevated levels and reflected actions taken to address the challenges encountered in the residential housing market and persisting credit quality issues in acquisition and development construction credits  commercial real estate credits and real estate mortgage loans

table of contents borrowings due to contraction in the loan portfolio experienced during  we utilized our liquidity to repay maturing fhlb borrowings 
fhlb borrowings were curtailed by million or during the year with no additional advances offsetting these repayments 
the average balance outstanding of short term borrowings did not exceed of stockholders equity during the years ended december  or capital adequacy the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
our capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining our well capitalized position at the banking subsidiary 
the primary source of additional capital is earnings retention  which represents net income less dividends declared 
during  we paid million in dividends and retained million  or of net income 
future dividends will be dependent upon our ability to generate earnings in future periods 
stockholders equity decreased by million  reflecting million of income  million in other comprehensive income  consisting mainly of million in unrealized holding gains net of tax and reclassification adjustments  million in accrued and paid dividends  million tarp repayment  and increases to additional paid in capital of million associated with the exercise of stock options and stock based compensation 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators which  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under fdicia  the consolidated company and our banking subsidiary must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the consolidated company and our banking subsidiary to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
as of december   and  both the consolidated company and our subsidiary bank met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject and are categorized as well capitalized  based on the most recent notification from the federal reserve bank of richmond 
these capital amounts and ratios are incorporated by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements herein 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the subsidiary bank s category 
liquidity liquidity is identified as the ability to generate or acquire sufficient amounts of cash when needed and at a reasonable cost to accommodate withdrawals  payments of debt  and increased loan demand 
these events may occur daily or at other short term intervals in the normal operation of the business 
experience helps management predict time cycles in the amount of cash required 
in assessing liquidity  management gives consideration to relevant factors including stability of deposits  quality of assets  economic conditions in the market served  concentrations of business and industry  competition  and our overall financial condition 
our bank subsidiary has available a million line of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta  uncollateralized  unused lines of credit totaling million with nonaffiliated banks and access to the federal reserve discount window to support liquidity as conditions dictate 
the liquidity of the consolidated company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s cash outflows consist of overhead associated with corporate expenses  executive management and shareholder related expenses 
it also includes outflows associated with dividends to shareholders 
the main sources of funding for the parent company are the management fees and dividends we receive from our banking subsidiary and availability on the equity market as deemed necessary 
during  the banking subsidiary paid million in management fees and transferred million in dividends to us 
as of january   there were no additional unrestricted funds that could be transferred from the bank subsidiary to us without prior regulatory approval  as the bank needs to earn million before it will have additional unrestricted funds that could be transferred to the parent 
the deficit arose due to the million tarp repayment  which when initiated  was a capital contribution from the parent to the bank subsidiary and was repaid to the parent upon exit from the program 
loans and advances are limited to of the banks common stock and capital surplus 
as of december   funds available for loans or advances by the bank to us  which is limited by the amount of collateral we have available to pledge  were approximately million 
the parent company generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities in  redeemed million in preferred stock  and paid dividends to stockholders of million 
management believes that the parent company s liquidity position is sufficient to cover all expenses until the bank subsidiary earns back the million deficit and is again able to transfer funds to the parent 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents at the parent company level 

table of contents contractual obligations the impact of our contractual obligations as of december  on liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 
table contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years certificates of deposit subordinated debt fhlb borrowings operating leases total the subordinated debt securities represent two issues maturing on june  and july   respectively 
both issues are currently callable 
table commitment expiration by period commitment expiration by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit in the judgment of management  we maintain the ability to generate sufficient amounts of cash to cover normal requirements and any additional needs which may arise  within realistic limitations 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had not participated in any material unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
we do have significant commitments to fund loans in the ordinary course of business 
at december  and  the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk 
table outstanding contracts with credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if we deem it necessary  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we are committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we generally hold collateral supporting those commitments  if deemed necessary 
we originate loans for sale to secondary market investors subject to contractually specified and limited recourse provisions through our banking subsidiary 
in  we originated million and sold million to investors  compared to million originated and million sold in at december   we had locked rate commitments to originate mortgage loans amounting to approximately million and loans held for sale of million 
we have entered into commitments  on a best effort basis to sell loans of approximately million 
risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations 

table of contents critical accounting estimates general our financial statements are prepared in accordance with usgaap as well as general practices within the banking industry 
in connection with the application of those principles  management has made judgments and estimates which  in the case of the determination of the allowance for loan losses  mortgage indemnifications and repurchases  deferred tax assets  foreclosed assets and the assessment of impairment of the intangibles have been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
management considers accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on the financial statements 
allowance for loan losses we consider the alll of million appropriate to cover losses incurred in the loan portfolio as of december  however  no assurance can be given that we will not  in any particular period  sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions  our ongoing credit review process or regulatory requirements  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses 
among other factors  a continued economic slowdown and or a decline in commercial or residential real estate values in our markets may have an adverse impact on the current adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss 
the total alll is generally available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the allocation of the alll disclosed in the asset quality table is subject to change based on the changes in criteria used to evaluate the allowance and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future losses in any particular portfolio 
the discussion and analysis included in this section contains detailed information regarding our alll  net charge offs  non performing assets  past due loans and potential problem loans 
included in this data are numerous portfolio ratios that must be carefully reviewed in relation to the nature of the underlying loan portfolios before appropriate conclusions can be reached regarding the company or for purposes of making comparisons to other banks 
most of our non performing assets and past due loans are secured by real estate 
given the nature of these assets and the related mortgage foreclosure  property sale and  if applicable  mortgage insurance claims processes  it can take months or longer for a loan to migrate from initial delinquency to final disposition 
this resolution process generally takes much longer for loans secured by real estate than for unsecured loans or loans secured by other property primarily due to state real estate foreclosure laws 
we categorize all business and commercial purpose loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information  historical payment experience  credit documentation  public information  and current economic trends  among other factors 
we analyze loans individually by setting the risk grade at the inception of a loan through the approval process 
the definitions used were refined in early and are reviewed for applicability annually 

table of contents the risk grades are formally affirmed quarterly by loan officers 
in addition  a certain percentage of business purpose dollars is reviewed each year through our loan review process 
the risk rating process is inherently subjective and based upon management s evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances for individual borrowers 
as such  the assigned risk ratings are subject to change based upon changes in borrower status and changes in the external environment affecting the borrower 
we use the following definitions for risk ratings risk grade prime risk 
loss potential is rated as none or extremely low 
loans fully secured by deposit accounts at the company s subsidiary bank will also be rated as risk grade risk grade excellent risk 
loss potential is demonstrably low 
loans have liquid financial statements or are secured by marketable securities or other liquid collateral 
risk grade good risk 
loss potential is low 
asset quality and liquidity are considered good 
overall leverage and liquidity measures are better than the industry in which the borrower operates and they are stable 
risk grade average risk 
loss potential is low  but evidence of risk exists 
margins and cash flow generally equal or exceed industry norm and policy guidelines  but some inconsistency may be evident 
asset quality is average with liquidity comparable to industry norms 
leverage may be slightly higher than the industry  but is stable 
risk grade marginal risk 
loss potential is variable  but there is potential for deterioration 
asset quality is marginally acceptable 
leverage may fluctuate and is above normal for the industry 
cash flow is marginally adequate 
risk grade special mention 
loss potential moderate if corrective action not taken 
evidence of declining revenues or margins  inadequate cash flow  and possibly high leverage or tightening liquidity 
risk grade substandard 
distinct possibility of loss to the bank  but no discernable impairment 
repayment ability of borrower is weak and the loan may have exhibited excessive overdue status  extension  or renewals 
risk grade doubtful 
loss potential is extremely high 
ability of the borrower to service the debt is weak  constant overdue status  loan has been placed on non accrual status and no definitive repayment schedule exists 
risk grade loss 
loans are considered fully uncollectible and charged off 
we utilize the nine point grading system in order to evaluate the level of inherent risk in the loan portfolio as part of our alll methodology 
loans collectively evaluated for impairment are grouped by loan type and  in the case of commercial and construction loans  by risk rating 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on risk grade  historical loss experience  economic conditions  overall portfolio quality including delinquency rates and commercial real estate loan concentrations as applicable 
loans graded or worse are assigned an additional reserve factor stated in basis points in order to account for the added inherent risk 
additional basis points are applied as a reserve factor to the loan balances as the corresponding loan grades indicate additional risk and increase from grade to grade 
table of contents accrued losses associated with indemnification agreements in certain loan sales  we provide recourse to the buyer whereby we are required to repurchase loans at par value plus accrued interest on the occurrence of certain credit related events within a certain time period 
the maximum exposure to loss represents the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold that are subject to recourse provisions  but the likelihood of the repurchase of the entire balance is remote and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale of collateral 
at december   thousand of losses associated with mortgage repurchases and indemnifications was accrued 
additionally  losses of thousand  million and million were recognized during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we enter into other types of indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business under which we agree to indemnify third parties against any damages  losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with us 
these relationships or transactions include those arising from service as a director or officer of the company  acquisition agreements and various other business transactions or arrangements 
because the extent of our obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events  our potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable 
deferred taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance may be established 
management considers the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy due to the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline  or if management projects lower levels of future taxable income 
if such a valuation allowance is deemed necessary in the future  it would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect operating results 
foreclosed assets foreclosed assets represent properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
write downs to fair value of foreclosed assets at the time of transfer are charged to allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  we periodically evaluate the value of foreclosed assets held for sale and record an impairment charge for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on an assessment of information available at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including historical experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
the evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we have an aggregate goodwill balance of million associated with previous merger transactions 
goodwill is associated with the commercial banking segment  as wealth management and mortgage banking were deemed immaterial at the time of assignation 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  we use both the income and market approaches to value our reporting units 
the income approach consists of discounting long term projected future cash flows  which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for the commercial banking segment 
we tested for impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets as of the annual assessment date  which is october the projected future cash flows are discounted using cost of capital metrics for our peer group or a build up approach such as the capital asset pricing model 
the market approach applies a market multiple  based on observed purchase transactions and or price earnings of our peer group for the reporting unit  to the last twelve months of net income or earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization or price tangible book value 
testing goodwill for impairment is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  which we employed in our analysis  involves estimating the fair value of the equity of the reporting unit 
for purposes of this assignment  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
this type of value reflects the premise of value of value in use 
value in use is derived from the on going operations of the business 
the fair value is then compared to the reporting unit s carrying value of equity 
in the event a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  evidence of potential impairment exists 
in such a case  the second step of the impairment test is required  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  with the excess of fair value over allocated net assets representing the fair value of its goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount  if any  by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill 
in  based on the results of the first step of the impairment test  we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill would have exceeded its estimated fair value at the valuation date 
because the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  management performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test as of october  the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by assigning the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if our commercial banking segment had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the commercial banking segment over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on the results of the second step of the impairment test as of october   management determined that goodwill was not impaired 
management considered the factors noted above that could lead to impairment between october  and december  and evaluated our overall business and the trading level of our stock in relation to both its book value and tangible book value 
based on these inputs  management concluded that no indications of impairment were present 
should management determine in a future period that the goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions has been impaired  then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period such determination is made 
long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  such as the core deposit intangible asset  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
management concluded that no circumstances indicating an impairment of these assets existed as of the balance sheet date 

table of contents non gaap financial measures this report refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing noninterest expense less amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairments as a percent of the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income excluding gains and impairments on securities  gain on sale of financial center and losses on foreclosed assets 
the efficiency ratio is not a recognized reporting measure under usgaap 
management believes this measure provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
management believes such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operating performance  but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for usgaap 
in referring to our net income  we are referring to income under usgaap 
comparison of the efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible  because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
the following table presents a reconciliation to provide a more detailed analysis of this non usgaap performance measure
