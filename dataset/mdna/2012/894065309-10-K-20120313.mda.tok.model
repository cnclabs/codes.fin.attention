next generation network infrastructure converged network infrastructure data and video services are the main drivers for future network infrastructure investments 
carrier ethernet is the industry s accepted standard technology for next generation networks  however  a large percentage of optical network infrastructure currently in place is based on sonet sdh technology designed and optimized for voice traffic 
our products enable a mix of voice and data traffic to be efficiently transported over existing sonet sdh networks using a number of techniques for mapping ethernet data into the sonet or sdh format eos in accordance with recently introduced industry standards 
our products are incorporated in optical transport equipment  and enable the fiber optic network to transport information with improved efficiency  thus increasing the overall network capacity 
we also supply products designed for use in ethernet equipment such as carrier grade ethernet routers and switches 
such products enable carriers to provide robust and differentiated services using ethernet technology in their wide area networks 
within this new infrastructure  voice traffic is also carried over ethernet  and we provide market leading solutions for use in equipment such as media gateways  soft switches and multi service access nodes used in both wire line and cellular carrier networks as well in corporate network applications 
currently  most telephony service providers maintain two separate networks one for legacy voice traffic and a second for data traffic 
voip technology compresses voice signals into discrete packets of data  thereby enabling the voice signals to be transmitted over lower cost networks originally designed for data only transmission 
voip technology is used in numerous new types of communications equipment  such as next generation carrier and enterprise class gateways  soft switches  digital loop carriers  ip dsl access multiplexers  media terminal adapters  and home gateways for use by consumers and small businesses 
these voip technology based devices enable more efficient and cost effective voice transmissions than their legacy circuit switched equipment counterparts 
in addition to significant cost savings  voip also enables advanced services that traditional telephony could not support 
voip technology enables and enhances features such as unified messaging and managed services that provide additional value to consumers and businesses and allow service providers to enhance revenue opportunities 
our customers in this market include alcatel lucent  tellabs  fiberhome  ericsson  nec and other oems 
the broadband access portion of the market includes equipment that provides last mile connectivity between the end customer and the network for broadband services 
it includes systems for connectivity over copper wires based on dsl  technology  fiber connectivity using passive optical network pon technology or wireless connectivity using cellular  wimax or other technologies 
our products are incorporated into broadband access equipment  enabling telecommunications service providers to deliver next generation services such as voice  data and video over the broadband connection 
fiber based broadband access  generally referred to as fttx  is deployed in a variety of alternative architectures such as fiber to the home ftth  fiber to the building fttb or fiber to the node fttn 
in the case of ftth  fiber extends all the way to each individual subscriber location  while in the case of fttb and fttn  fiber extends to multiplexing equipment located at a building with multiple end users or in a neighborhood node  and each subscriber location residence or office is connected to the multiplexing equipment with copper wire using dsl or ethernet technology 
ftth provides the highest bandwidth per subscriber  while fttb and fttn provide a more economical alternative 
the underlying technology for most fttx deployments is passive optical networking pon because it eliminates the need for active electronics in the fiber portion of the network 
there are dominant variants of this technology  namely ethernet based pon epon which has been adopted extensively in japan and to a lesser extent in other asian countries  and gigabit pon gpon which is currently being deployed primarily in north america and is expected to be deployed in several other regions worldwide 
epon supports data rates up to gigabit per second gbps while gpon supports data rates up to gbps 
fttx technology provides higher speeds than dsl technology for both residential and business end users and enables service providers to offer a wider range of next generation bundled services to potentially enhance their revenue streams 
our broadband access product offerings include a variety of solutions for both epon as well as gpon standards 
we also supply products that support the hybrid fiber copper architectures such as fttb and fttn using dsl or ethernet as well as voice over ip voip processors to extract  encode and manage voice services at the node equipment in the case of fttb and fttn architectures 
our customers in this market include alcatel lucent  sumitomo  nokia siemens networks and other oems 
broadband customer premises equipment broadband cpe the increasing role of broadband cpe in the delivery of modern communications services is driven directly by the deployment of broadband access networks discussed above 
a single broadband connection is capable of delivering multiple services voice  video and data to the subscriber location in the form of a high speed packetized data stream 
broadband cpe must then process this high speed packet data stream and deliver the various services to appliances within the home or office in the appropriate manner 
for instance  telephone voice service needs to be converted from packetized data using voip technology into its native electrical form and distributed over the internal telephone wiring or using a wireless technology such as digital enhanced cordless telecommunications to cordless phones 
similarly  internet data traffic must be routed over ethernet connections or wifi to computers within the customer premises and video traffic must be routed to set top devices or tv sets as appropriate 
increasing availability of high definition video content is driving the need for high speed connectivity within the home 
the consumer electronics industry standard known as high definition multimedia interface hdmi and the related displayport standard adopted by the computer industry are the de facto interfaces of choice 
broadband cpe equipment also provides the necessary security features such as firewall and data encryption as well as a host of other management and control functions required for interworking with the service provider s network 
we provide high speed interface technology conforming to hdmi  displayport and ethernet standards in the form of ip cores 
our customers for this technology are other semiconductor companies who supply complementary markets such as consumer electronics tv  dvr and video camera and computer equipment manufacturers 
we also provide a family of communications processors designed specifically for broadband cpe applications  combining voip  data routing and security functions in a single highly integrated device that meets the stringent cost performance and low power consumption demands of this market segment 
our products and the functions they serve our products provide several of the key functionalities required for converged network infrastructure and broadband cpe converged network infrastructure a infrastructure voip processors b eos eopdh mappers and framers c tributary switches d carrier ethernet solutions e fttx protocol processors f access voip processors g access controllers broadband cpe a multi service communications processors b connectivity solutions hdmi  displayport  hdp tm  ethernet ip cores and hdp tm transceivers within each of these markets  we have developed a number of product families as described below products for converged network infrastructure a infrastructure voip processors our entropia series of processors are highly integrated soc solutions each incorporating multiple embedded reduced instruction set computing and digital signal processing processors for encoding  decoding and transcoding voip traffic according to a multitude of protocols and standards adopted in different networks worldwide 
entropia iii and iv can process up to  voice channels for high capacity applications while our entropia ii lp product supports medium density applications requiring up to voice channels 
the entropia series is designed for wire line and wireless carrier equipment such as media gateways  soft switches  ims and msan as well as in enterprise network applications such as ip pbx 
because different voip coding standards are used by different network operators  a vital attribute of our entropia processors is their ability to recognize and dynamically adapt to the appropriate coding standard and to trans code the voice traffic from one standard to another as required 
in addition to voip processing  our entropia products provide a complete system level solution by incorporating a variety of other related functions such as fax relay  packet processing  circuit emulation  signaling and control required for operation in the carrier s network 
b eos eopdh mappers and framers our products address the predominant formats and data speeds employed in the access portion of the network 
we provide solutions that cover both north american sonet async as well as international sdh pdh standards 
data rates covered by our products range from mb s to gb s 
our ethermap and etherphast product families address the need of carriers to efficiently transport data traffic over their existing sonet  sdh and pdh networks 
our vtxp products provide low level grooming of time division multiplexing tdm circuits which will continue to be a requirement throughout the transition to ip and will be performed predominantly in smaller edge platforms rather than larger metro platforms 
our products are optimized for these edge platforms  and will continue to be applicable as will our broad line of mappers and framers 
c tributary switches this product category includes switch fabric devices and adjunct switching devices that enable traffic to be switched or re arranged groomed to use network capacity more efficiently 
d carrier ethernet solutions as carriers move to packet based networks for more and more of their infrastructure  the need for both pure carrier class ethernet devices as well as transition products continues to grow 
our envoy line of ethernet controllers and switches allows for differentiation and creates the opportunity for market leadership with trend setting metro ethernet features 
our packettrunk family of circuit emulation and clock recovery devices provides vital interworking capability between the new ip based services and infrastructures and the legacy voice tdm based services and infrastructures 
e fttx protocol processors the prevalent passive optical networking standards are epon which is adopted primarily in japan  china and korea and a more recent standard gpon  which has been adopted by carriers in the united states and is expected to be the deployed in several other countries 
our diplomat ont product is a highly integrated soc solution for gpon onu applications equipped to provide up to four channels of voip processing and is interoperable with optical line terminations olts from the leading equipment suppliers worldwide 
f access voip processors a large percentage of fiber based broadband access deployments are hybrid fiber copper architectures such as fttn or fttb 
this is particularly true in countries such as china where large apartment buildings rather than single family houses are the norm 
even in the united states  at t has chosen to deploy fiber to the node rather than fiber to the home based on its own economic analysis 
in these hybrid architectures  the fiber cable terminates in optical network termination ont equipment designed to serve multiple subscribers is placed in a neighborhood site or in the basement of the apartment building  and the individual subscriber locations are served over copper wires using vdsl or ethernet technology 
voice traffic is carried over the fiber portion of the network in packetized form voip  and is decoded and converted to the analog form at the ont so it can be transmitted over the copper wires 
our entropia tm iii c series of processors is designed to serve these applications 
this new series of entropia processors scales the market proven features and performance advantages of our larger flagship entropia iii and entropia iv series into an appropriately sized  highly integrated soc that is ideally matched to the requirements for broadband access ont equipment 
g access controllers the multi subscriber ont equipment in fttb or fttn architectures performs the function of an access multiplexor in that it must appropriately route the appropriate data from the fiber connection to the each subscriber over a separate copper connection and vice versa 
data security  quality of service  and traffic management features are critical elements of this functionality 
our diplomat ip access controller is designed to provide this core functionality for xdsl equipment such as msan  and mdu ont for fttn and fttb networks

item a 
risk factors from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k may contain statements that are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  should  could  will  expect  intend  plans  predict  anticipate  estimate  continue  believe or the negative of these terms or other similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward looking information 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this form k 
our actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our strategic direction has changed 
the company has gone from primarily providing vlsi infrastructure products to more customer premise licensing ip cores and voip based products 
as a result  we are suffering through a period of larger losses  including from operations as well as from write downs of goodwill and other intangibles assets 
our total revenue has decreased from million in to million in product revenue has decreased from million in to million in as our business model changes there can be no assurances that the move to these new product lines will produce acceptable results 
moreover  any other future changes to our business may not prove successful in the short or long term due to a variety of factors  including competition  customer acceptance  demand for our products and other factors 
this may cause a material negative impact on our financial results 
we are using our available cash and cash equivalents each quarter to fund our operations  investments and financing activities 
we have incurred significant losses in prior periods 
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future and we may incur losses and negative cash flows in future periods 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  our customers product to market launch schedules  our ability to develop  introduce  market and support new products and technologies on a timely basis  availability and cost of products from our suppliers  intellectual property disputes  the timing of receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers  the effects of our competitors new product and technology introductions  fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers and distributors and changes in our customers and distributors inventory management practices  shifts in our product mix and the effect of maturing products  the timing and extent of product development costs  new product and technology introductions by us or our competitors  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  and significant warranty claims  including those not covered by our suppliers 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast  and these  as well as other factors  could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results 
our operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock could decline 
our net revenues may decrease 
due to current economic conditions and slowdowns in purchases of vlsi semiconductor devices  it has become increasingly difficult for us to predict the purchasing activities of our telecom customers and we expect that our net revenues may decrease further 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to our customers 
because we do not have substantial non cancelable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
future fluctuations to our operating results may also be caused by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our foundries  we may order inventory and materials in advance of anticipated customer demand  which might result in excess inventory levels if the expected orders fail to materialize 
as a result  we cannot predict the timing and amount of shipments to our customers  and any significant downturn in customer demand for our products would reduce our quarterly and annual operating results 
if we seek to secure additional financing we may not be able to do so 
if we are able to secure additional financing our stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest or we may be subject to limitations on our operations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures  we may need to raise additional funds 
however  events in the future may require us to seek additional capital and  if so required  that capital may not be available on terms favorable or acceptable to us  if at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest  and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock 
on october   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s file no 
the shelf registration statement which was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october   to sell up to  of our securities 
during and  we issued shares for proceeds to the company in an amount of  worth of common stock under the shelf registration statement 
accordingly  we have a value of  of shares of our common stock  which could still be issued under this arrangement 
on february   we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement with mlv co 
llc mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to  from time to time through mlv 
our stock price is volatile 
the market for securities for communication semiconductor companies  including our company  has been highly volatile 
the daily closing price of our common stock has fluctuated between a low of and a high of share price is reflective of the november  for reverse stock split during the period from january  to december  it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate widely in the future 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include responses to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  current market conditions in our served markets  and changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
we may have to further restructure our business 
we may have to make further restructuring changes if we do not sustain the current level of quarterly revenues 
our restructurings could result in management distractions  operational disruptions  and other difficulties 
over the past several years  we have initiated several restructuring activities in an effort to reduce operating costs 
our most recent restructuring was announced on october  employees whose positions were eliminated in connection with these restructuring activities may seek employment with our customers or competitors 
although each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of hire  we cannot guarantee that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  we cannot guarantee that we will not undertake additional restructuring activities and that our restructuring efforts will be successful  or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous restructuring plans 
also  if we continue to reduce our workforce  it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to new growth opportunities 
we anticipate that shipments of our products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenues 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our total net revenues in any particular period 
for the years ended december  and  shipments to our top five customers  including sales through distributors  accounted for approximately and of our total net revenues  respectively 
we expect that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future 
some of the following may reduce our total net revenues or adversely affect our business reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers  development by one or more of our significant customers of other sources of supply for current or future products  loss of one or more of our current customers or a disruption in our sales and distribution channels  and failure of one or more of our significant customers to make timely payment of our invoices 
we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will return to the levels of previous periods or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
we have no long term volume purchase commitments from any of our significant customers 
the cyclical nature of the communication semiconductor industry affects our business 
communication service providers  internet service providers  regional operating companies and inter exchange carriers continue to closely monitor their capital expenditures 
spending on voice only equipment remains slow while spending on equipment providing the efficient transport of data services on existing infrastructure appears to be slowly recovering 
demand for new  high bandwidth applications such as video conferencing  broadband audio and telephone is placing an increased burden on existing public network infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that the market for our products will not decline in the future 
because of our lack of diversity in geographic sources of revenues  economic factors specific to certain countries may adversely affect our business and operating results 
during  a substantial amount of our revenue was from china  japan  korea  taiwan  italy  israel and other foreign countries 
we expect revenues in will be substantially concentrated in foreign markets 
all of our sales have been historically denominated in us dollars and major fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially affect our customers demand  thereby causing them to reduce their orders  which could adversely affect our operating results 
while part of our strategy is to diversify the geographic sources of our revenues  failure to further penetrate other markets could harm our business and results of operations and subject us to increased currency risk 
if foreign exchange rates fluctuate significantly  our profitability may decline 
we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations because we incur a significant portion of our operating expenses in currencies other than us dollars mainly indian rupees  israeli shekels and euros 
the us dollar has fluctuated significantly in the past couple of years and this trend may continue 
our international business operations expose us to a variety of business risks 
foreign markets are a significant part of our net product revenues 
for the years ended december  and  foreign shipments accounted for approximately and  respectively of our total net product and services revenues 
we expect foreign markets to continue to account for a significant percentage of our total net revenues 
a significant portion of our total net revenues will  therefore  be subject to risks associated with foreign markets  including the following unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and policy changes affecting the telecommunications and data communications markets  changes in tariffs  exchange rates  currency controls and other barriers  political and economic instability  risk of terrorism or war  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property overseas  natural disasters  seasonality of customer buying patterns  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although substantially all of our total net revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars  the value of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies also may reduce our total net revenues from foreign customers 
a substantial amount of our costs are denominated in israeli shekels and the indian rupees 
to the extent that we further expand our international operations or change our pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  we will expose our margins to increased risks of currency fluctuations 
our net product revenues depend on the success of our customers products  and our design wins do not necessarily generate revenues in a timely fashion 
our customers generally incorporate our new products into their products or systems at the design stage 
however  customer decisions to use our products design wins  which can often require significant expenditures by us without any assurance of success  often precede the generation of production revenues  if any  by a year or more 
some customer projects are canceled  and thus will not generate revenues for our products 
in addition  even after we achieve a design win  a customer may require further design changes 
implementing these design changes can require significant expenditures of time and expense by us in the development and pre production process 
moreover  the value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer s product and on the extent to which the design of the customer s systems accommodates components manufactured by our competitors 
we cannot ensure that we will continue to achieve design wins in customer products that achieve market acceptance 
further  most revenue generating design wins take several years to translate into meaningful revenues 
we must successfully transition to new process technologies to remain competitive 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop products that utilize new process technologies 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change and require large expenditures for research and development 
we currently manufacture our products using  and nanometer complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos processes 
we continuously evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in transitioning to new manufacturing processes and  consequently  have suffered increased costs  reduced yields or delays in product deliveries 
we believe that transitioning our products to smaller geometry process technologies will be important for us to remain competitive 
we cannot be certain that we can make such a transition successfully  if at all  without delay or inefficiencies 
our success depends on the timely development of new products  and we face risks of product development delays 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new devices and software for existing and new markets 
the development of these new devices and software is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including the following accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achievement of manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
our success also depends upon our ability to do the following build products to applicable standards or customer specifications  develop products that meet customer requirements  adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully  introduce new products that achieve market acceptance  and develop reliable software to meet our customers application needs in a timely fashion 
in addition  we cannot ensure that the systems manufactured by our customers will be introduced in a timely manner or that such systems will achieve market acceptance 
we sell a range of products that each has a different gross profit 
our total gross profits will be adversely affected if most of our shipments are of products with low gross profits 
we currently sell more than product families 
some of our products have a high gross profit while others do not 
if our customers decide to buy more of our products with low gross profits and fewer of our products with high gross profits  our total gross profits could be adversely affected 
we plan our mix of products based on our internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
the price of our products tends to decrease over the lives of our products 
historically  average selling prices in the communication semiconductor industry have decreased over the life of a product  and  as a result  the average selling prices of our products may decrease in the future 
decreases in the price of our products would adversely affect our operating results 
as global competition increases  our customers are increasingly more focused on price 
we may have to decrease our prices to remain competitive in some situations  which may negatively impact our gross margins 
our success depends on the rate of growth of the global communications infrastructure 
we currently derive most of our net revenues from products for telecommunications  data and video communications applications 
these markets are characterized by the following susceptibility to seasonality of customer buying patterns  subject to general business cycles  intense competition  rapid technological change  and short product life cycles 
we anticipate that these markets will continue to experience significant volatility and reduced demand in the near future 
our products must successfully include industry standards to remain competitive 
products for telecommunications and data communications applications are based on industry standards  which are continually evolving 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards  which could render our existing products unmarketable or obsolete 
if the telecommunications or data communications markets evolve to new standards  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers and include the new standards or that such new products will meet with substantial market acceptance 
our business has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions  and the current uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy makes it more likely that our actual results will differ materially from expectations 
global credit and financial markets continue to experience disruptions  including diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and continued uncertainty about economic stability 
despite signs of improvement  there can be no assurance that there will not be renewed deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
the continued or further tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to cancel  decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
the volatility in the credit markets has severely diminished liquidity and capital availability 
the licensing component of our business strategy increases business risk and volatility 
part of our business strategy is to license ip through agreements with companies whereby companies incorporate our ip into their respective technologies that address certain markets 
there can be no assurance that additional companies will be interested in licensing our technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
we also cannot ensure that companies who license our technology will introduce and sell products incorporating our technology  will accurately report royalties owed to us  will pay agreed upon royalties  will honor agreed upon market restrictions  will not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property and will maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information 
the ip agreements are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances 
many of these factors require significant judgments 
licensing revenue could fluctuate significantly from period to period because it is heavily dependent on a few key deals being completed in a particular period  the timing of which is difficult to predict and may not match our expectations 
because of its high margin content  the licensing mix of our revenue can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit and profitability 
also  generating revenue from these arrangements is a lengthy and complex process that may last beyond the period in which efforts begin and once an agreement is in place  the timing of revenue recognition may be dependent on customer acceptance of deliverables  achievement of milestones  our ability to track and report progress on contracts  customer commercialization of the licensed technology and other factors 
licensing that occurs in connection with actual or contemplated litigation is subject to risk that the adversarial nature of the transaction will induce non compliance or non payment 
the accounting rules associated with recognizing revenue from these transactions are increasingly complex and subject to interpretation 
due to these factors  the amount of license revenue recognized in any period may differ significantly from our expectations 
our intellectual property indemnification practices may adversely impact our business 
we have historically agreed to indemnify our customers for certain costs and damages of intellectual property rights in circumstances where one of our products is the factor creating the customer s infringement exposure 
this practice may subject us to significant indemnification claims by our customers 
in some instances  our products are designed for use in devices manufactured by our customers that comply with international standards 
these international standards are often covered by patent rights held by third parties  which may include our competitors 
the costs of obtaining licenses from holders of patent rights essential to such international standards could be high 
the cost of not obtaining such licenses could also be high if a holder of such patent rights brings a claim for patent infringement 
we are not aware of any claimed violations on our part 
however  we cannot assure you that claims for indemnification will not be made or that if made  such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we continue to expense our new product process development costs when incurred 
in the past  we have incurred significant new product and process development costs because our policy is to expense these costs  including tooling  fabrication and pre production expenses  at the time that they are incurred 
we may continue to incur these types of expenses in the future 
these additional expenses will have a material and adverse effect on our operating results in future periods 
we face intense competition in the semiconductor market 
the communication semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by the following rapid technological change  subject to general business cycles  price erosion  limited access to fabrication capacity  unforeseen manufacturing yield problems  and heightened international competition in many markets 
these factors are likely to result in pricing pressures on our products  thus potentially affecting our operating results 
our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving area of high performance integrated circuit technology depends on factors both within and outside our control  including success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  protection of our products by effective use of intellectual property laws  product quality  reliability  price  efficiency of production  failure to find alternative manufacturing sources to produce our products with acceptable manufacturing yields  the pace at which customers incorporate our products into their products  success of competitors products  and general economic conditions 
the markets that we serve are intensely competitive 
a number of our customers have internal semiconductor design or manufacturing capability with which we also compete in addition to our other competitors 
any failure by us to compete successfully in these target markets  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on outside fabrication facilities  and our business could be hurt if our relationships with our foundry suppliers are damaged 
we do not own or operate a vlsi circuit fabrication facility 
a few foundries currently supply us with all of our semiconductor device requirements 
while we have had good relations with these foundries  we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew or maintain contracts with them or negotiate new contracts to replace those that expire 
in addition  we cannot be certain that renewed or new contracts will contain terms as favorable as our current terms 
there are other significant risks associated with our reliance on outside foundries  including the following the lack of assured semiconductor wafer supply and control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of  or delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies  and limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 
reliance on third party fabrication facilities limits our ability to control the manufacturing process 
manufacturing integrated circuits is a highly complex and technology intensive process 
we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  however  our foundries occasionally experience lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new process technologies 
such reduced manufacturing yields have at times reduced our operating results 
a manufacturing disruption at one or more of our outside foundries  including  without limitation  those that may result from natural disasters  accidents  acts of terrorism or political instability or other natural occurrences  could impact production for an extended period of time 
our dependence on a small number of fabrication facilities exposes us to risks of interruptions in deliveries of semiconductor devices 
we purchase semiconductor devices from outside foundries pursuant to purchase orders  and we do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity at any of our foundries 
we provide the foundries with forecasts of our production requirements 
however  the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by the foundry s available capacity and the availability of raw materials 
therefore  our foundry suppliers could choose to prioritize capacity and raw materials for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that our foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements 
we have been  and expect in the future to be  particularly dependent upon a limited number of foundries for our vlsi device requirements 
in  one outside wafer foundry supplied a substantial amount of our total semiconductor wafer requirements 
the time required to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products could be substantial and we might not be able to find alternative manufacturing sources able to produce our vlsi devices with acceptable manufacturing yields 
as a result  we expect that we could experience substantial delays or interruptions in the shipment of our products if there was a sudden increase in demand or if our foundry suppliers were to cease operations or limit our capacity 
we are subject to risks arising from our use of subcontractors to assemble our products 
contract assembly houses in asia assemble all of our semiconductor products 
raw material shortages  natural disasters  political and social instability  service disruptions  labor disputes  rising wages  currency fluctuations  or other circumstances in the region could force us to seek additional or alternative sources of supply or assembly 
this could lead to supply constraints or product delivery delays 
our failure to protect our proprietary rights  or the costs of protecting these rights  may harm our ability to compete 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and development and testing tools 
to that end  we have obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive 
we cannot ensure the following that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications  that our existing patents or any new patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us  that foreign intellectual property laws will protect our foreign intellectual property rights  and that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around any patents issued to us 
intellectual property rights are uncertain and adjudication of such rights involves complex legal and factual questions 
we may be unknowingly infringing on the proprietary rights of others and may be liable for that infringement  which could result in significant liability for us 
we occasionally receive correspondence from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  we could be forced to either seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the proprietary rights of others 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
we are responsible for any patent litigation costs 
if we were to become involved in a dispute regarding intellectual property  whether ours or that of another company  we may have to participate in legal proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office or in the united states or foreign courts to determine any or all of the following issues patent validity  patent infringement  patent ownership or inventorship 
these types of proceedings may be costly and time consuming for us  even if we eventually prevail 
if we do not prevail  we might be forced to pay significant damages  obtain a license  if available  or stop making a certain product 
from time to time  we may prosecute patent litigation against others and as part of such litigation  other parties may allege that our patents are not infringed  are invalid and are unenforceable 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and confidentiality provisions in agreements with employees and consultants to protect our intellectual property 
such parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us  and we may not be able to adequately enforce our rights against these parties 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 
if our cash  cash equivalents and operating cash flows are inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the amended and restated business financing agreement between us and bridge bank  na or our other obligations  we would be in default under their respective terms 
any such default or cross default would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
the loss of key management could affect our ability to run our business 
our success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate other qualified personnel 
as the source of our technological and product innovations  our key technical personnel represent a significant asset 
the competition for such personnel can be intense in the semiconductor industry 
we may also have a particularly hard time attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor performance and during this period following our most recent restructuring 
we may engage in acquisitions that may harm our operating results  dilute our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities 
we may pursue acquisitions from time to time that could provide new technologies  skills  products or service offerings 
future acquisitions by us may involve the following use of significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  and incurrence of debt or amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definitive lives 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous other risks  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and unanticipated expenses and operational disruptions while acquiring and integrating new acquisitions 
from time to time  we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines  technologies and businesses 
we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
if such an acquisition does occur  we cannot be certain that our business  operating results and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business could be harmed if we fail to integrate future acquisitions adequately 
during the past five years  we have acquired three companies  one based in the united states and two in israel 
our management must devote time and resources to the integration of the operations of any future acquisitions 
the process of integrating research and development initiatives  computer and accounting systems and other aspects of the operations of any future acquisitions presents a significant challenge to our management 
this is compounded by the challenge of simultaneously managing a larger and more geographically dispersed entity 
future acquisitions could present a number of additional difficulties of integration  including difficulties in integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and cultures  difficulties in defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy  and difficulties in minimizing the loss of key employees of the acquired company 
if we delay integrating or fail to integrate operations or experience other unforeseen difficulties  the integration process may require a disproportionate amount of our management s attention and financial and other resources 
our failure to address these difficulties adequately could harm our business or financial results  and we could fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction 
we have  in the past  as a result of industry conditions  discontinued or abandoned certain product lines acquired through acquisitions 
we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility  which if it occurs  will distract our management and could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us 
in the past  securities and class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities 
we may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which could cause serious harm to our business  operating results and financial condition or dilution to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws  rights agreement and delaware law may discourage takeover offers and may limit the price investors would be willing to pay for our common stock 
delaware corporate law contains  and our certificate of incorporation and by laws and rights agreement contain  certain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
certain of these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock preferred stock which our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval with rights senior to those of common stock  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  and dilute stockholders who acquire more than of our common stock 
natural disasters or acts of terrorism affecting our locations  or those of our suppliers  in the united states or internationally may negatively impact our business 
we operate our businesses in the united states and internationally  including the operation of a design center in india  and sales  design and engineering operations in israel 
some of the countries in which we operate or in which our customers are located have in the past been subject to terrorist acts and could continue to be subject to acts of terrorism 
in addition  some of these areas may be subject to natural disasters  such as earthquakes or floods 
if our facilities  or those of our suppliers or customers  are affected by a natural disaster or terrorist act  our employees could be injured and those facilities damaged  which could lead to loss of skill sets and affect the development or fabrication of our products  which could lead to lower short and long term revenues 
in addition  natural disasters or terrorist acts in the areas in which we operate or in which our customers or suppliers operate could lead to delays or loss of business opportunities  as well as changes in security and operations at those locations  which could increase our operating costs 
our ability to sublease excess office space may adversely affect our future cash outflows 
we have outstanding operating lease commitments of approximately million  payable over the next six years 
some of these commitments are for space that is not being utilized and  for which  we recorded restructuring charges in prior periods 
we currently have subleases for the majority of our excess space but our sublease income generated will not offset the entire future commitment 
as of december   we have sublease agreements totaling approximately million to rent portions of our excess facilities over the next six years 
we currently believe that we can fund these lease commitments in the future  however  there can be no assurances that we will not be required to seek additional capital or provide additional guarantees or collateral on these obligations 
of the office space being leased in our shelton  connecticut location  as of december   approximately  square feet is considered excess  the majority of which we have taken restructuring charges for in prior years 
substantially all of this space is currently being sublet  but not for the full amount of our lease obligation 
if we are unable to collect our sub lease rents  our future cash outflows would be adversely affected

also on february   we filed a prospectus supplement with the securities and exchange commission in connection with the offering 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  which are prepared to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the period reported 
we are also required to disclose amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
our actual results in future periods could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
we consider the most critical accounting policies and uses of estimates in our consolidated financial statements to be those relating to recognizing net revenues  cost of revenues and gross profit  estimating allowances for doubtful accounts  estimating assumptions used in the calculation of stock based compensation  estimating values for intangibles and long lived assets  estimating values used for the goodwill impairment analysis  estimating excess inventories  estimating restructuring liabilities  and estimating values of investments in non publicly traded companies 
these accounting policies  the bases for these estimates and their potential impact to our consolidated financial statements  should any of these estimates change  are further described as follows net revenues  cost of revenues and gross profit 
net revenues are primarily comprised of product shipments  principally to domestic and international telecommunications and data communications oems and to distributors 
net revenues from product sales to oems are recognized at the time of product shipment when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from our distributors can be recognized when the prices are fixed at the date of shipment from our facilities  payment is not contractually or otherwise excused until the product is resold  we do not have any obligations for future performance relating to the resale of the product  and the amount of future returns  allowances  refunds and costs to be incurred can be reasonably estimated and are accrued at the time of shipment 
agreements with certain distributors provide price protection and return and allowance rights 
service revenues are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have performed a service in accordance with our contractual obligations  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
at the time of shipment  we record a reduction to revenue with a related liability to accrue for future price protection 
this liability is established based on historical experience  contractually agreed to provisions and future shipment forecasts 
such accruals have been insignificant for the last three years 
we also accrue  at the time of shipment  a reduction to revenue with a related liability and an inventory asset against product cost of revenues in order to establish a provision for the gross margin related to future returns under our distributor stock rotation program 
such accruals related to reductions of revenue were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the accruals related to inventory assets are insignificant to our financial position and results of operations for all periods presented 
should our actual experience differ from our estimated liabilities  there could be adjustments either favorable or unfavorable to our net revenues  cost of revenues and gross profits 
we warranty our products for up to one year from the date of shipment 
warranty expense is insignificant to all periods presented 
we license connectivity solutions  including hdmi  displayport and ethernet ip cores 
revenues from licensing arrangements generally consist of multiple elements such as license  implementation and maintenance services 
the items deliverables included in the arrangements are evaluated to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
we perform this evaluation at the inception of an arrangement and as we deliver each item in the arrangement 
generally  we account for a deliverable or a group of deliverables separately if the delivered item s has standalone value to the customer  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items included in the arrangement  and if we have given the customer a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items or services are probable and substantially in our control 
we also recognize revenue from royalties upon notification of sale by our licensees 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally require licensees to give us notification and to pay royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales by the licensees take place 
estimated allowances for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based upon specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible along with our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required 
we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in the creditworthiness of such a customer or other matters affecting the collectability of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
stock based compensation 
determining the amount of stock based compensation for awards granted includes selecting an appropriate model to calculate fair value at the grant date 
we have used the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock option awards 
certain inputs to this valuation model require considerable judgment 
these inputs include estimating the volatility of our stock  the expected life of the option awarded and the forfeiture rate 
we have estimated volatility  the expected life and the forfeiture rate based on historical data 
volatility is estimated over a term that approximates the expected life of the option awarded 
intangibles and long lived assets including goodwill 
we review long lived and intangible assets including goodwill for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that a long lived asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related asset s undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset is made to measure whether the carrying value is recoverable 
any impairment is measured based upon the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value which is generally based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows 
a significant amount of management judgment is used in estimating future discounted cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  impairment testing for certain purchased customer relationships and developed technology was performed by us and indicated that the undiscounted future cash flows of these intangible assets were less than its corresponding carrying amount 
as a result of the analyses performed  we measured and recorded an impairment of these intangible assets of million in the impaired purchased customer relationships and developed technology related to a business acquisition in we did not record any impairment changes on any other intangibles or long lived assets in our impairment review of goodwill was performed using a fair value method and discounted cash flow models with estimated cash flows based on internal forecasts which included terminal values based on current market valuation metrics 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating fair value  we used our common stock s market price to determine fair value and other valuation metrics 
in addition  we performed discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting units to determine fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  impairment testing performed by us indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit tested was less than its corresponding carrying amount 
as a result of the analyses performed  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in the impaired goodwill related to a business acquisition in we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in during the fourth quarter of  impairment testing we performed indicated that the estimated fair values of two reporting units tested were less than their corresponding carrying amounts 
as a result of the analyses performed  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the impaired goodwill related to business acquisitions in and a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing impairment tests 
while we believe that our judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  additional impairment charges could be required 
estimated excess inventories 
we periodically review our inventory levels to determine if inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the telecommunications and data communications industries have experienced a significant downturn during the past few years and  as a result  we have had to evaluate our inventory position based on known backlog of orders  projected sales and marketing forecasts  shipment activity and inventory held at our significant distributors 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventories totaling approximately million in  million in and million in during  and  we recorded net product revenues of approximately million  million and million  respectively  on shipments of excess and obsolete inventory that had previously been written down to their estimated net realizable value of zero 
this resulted in almost gross margin on these product revenues 
had these products been sold at our historical average cost basis  gross margin on these revenues would have been  and in  and respectively 
we currently do not anticipate that a significant amount of the excess and obsolete inventories subject to the write downs described above will be used in the future based upon our current demand forecast 
should our actual future demand exceed the estimates that we used in writing down our excess and obsolete inventories  we will recognize a favorable impact to cost of revenues and gross profits 
should demand fall below our current expectations  we may record additional inventory write downs which will result in a negative impact to cost of revenues and gross profits 
estimated restructuring liabilities 
during  we recorded a net restructuring benefit of million 
on december   we entered into an amendment the amendment to a sublease agreement the sublease with an unaffiliated party to sublease  square feet of our office space in shelton  connecticut 
as a result of the sublease  we reversed approximately million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities 
this amendment extends the sublease through may this benefit was partially offset by approximately million of charges for workforce reductions implemented during in the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan that included a workforce reduction of approximately positions primarily in our shelton  connecticut  fremont  california  new delhi  india and bangalore  india locations 
we also implemented a restructuring plan in the first quarter of that included a workforce reduction of approximately positions primarily in our fremont  california  new delhi  india and bangalore  india locations 
the restructuring charges are primarily for employee termination benefits 
during  we recorded a net restructuring charge of approximately million 
we implemented a restructuring plan in the first quarter of that included a workforce reduction of approximately positions in our shelton  connecticut  fremont  california  new delhi  india and bangalore  india locations 
the restructuring charges were primarily for employee termination benefits 
all of the related cash expenditures were paid during during  we recorded a net restructuring benefit of million related to new sublease agreements we entered into during for unused space in our shelton  connecticut location which were partially offset by charges related to workforce reductions and other restructuring adjustments 
at december  and  the restructuring liabilities were million and million  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
restructuring liabilities at december  include approximately million of liabilities for facility lease costs and approximately million for employee termination benefits refer to note restructuring charges of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these facility operating leases expire in the future cash outlays for all of our operating lease commitments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain assumptions are used by us to derive this estimate  including future maintenance costs  price escalation and sublease income derived from these facilities 
should we negotiate additional sublease rental income agreements or reach a settlement with our lessors to be released from our existing obligations  we could realize a favorable benefit to our results of future operations 
should future lease  maintenance or other costs related to these facilities exceed our estimates  we could incur additional expenses in future periods 
valuation of investments in non publicly traded companies 
we have been making strategic equity investments in non publicly traded companies that develop technologies that are complementary to our product road map 
depending on our level of ownership and whether or not we have the ability to exercise significant influence  we account for these investments on either the cost or equity method  and review such investments periodically for impairment 
the appropriate reductions in carrying values are recorded when  and if  necessary 
the process of assessing whether a particular investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment 
in making this judgment  we carefully consider the investee s cash position  projected cash flows both short and long term  financing needs  most recent valuation data  the current investing environment  management ownership changes  and competition 
this evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure and audit requirements as the reports required of united states public companies  and as such  the reliability and accuracy of the data may vary 
based on our evaluations  we recorded impairment charges related to our investments in non publicly traded companies of zero  zero  and less than million during  and  respectively 
also  during the first quarter of  we sold our investment in opulan technologies corp 
opulan for million 
the carrying value of this investment in opulan was also million and accordingly no gain or loss was recorded on this transaction 
the total investment in non public companies was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for further discussion  please refer to note investments in non publicly traded companies and venture capital funds in our consolidated financial statements 
we used the modified equity method of accounting to determine the impairment loss for certain investments  as it was determined that no better current evidence of the value of our cost method investments existed and we believe that this gives us the best basis for our estimate given the historic negative cash flows of these companies 
the modified equity method of accounting results in recording an impairment loss on a cost method investment equal to the investor s proportionate share of the investee s losses as its contributed capital is consumed to fund operating losses of the investee from the inception of the investor s investment 
results of operations the results of operations that follow should be read in conjunction with our critical accounting policies and estimates summarized above as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item of this report 
the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated

year ended december  year ended december  percentage increase decrease in revenues tabular dollars in thousands revenues percent of total revenues revenues percent of total revenues network infrastructure   customer premises equipment   total   total net revenues in were million as compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
our network infrastructure revenues decrease of approximately was a result of lower sales of optical transport and voip products due to reduced telecom infrastructure capital expenditures and reduced sales of our asic products 
our cpe revenues decrease of approximately was attributable to the ramping down of our mustang gigabit ethernet passive optical product line towards the end of and reduced sales of our communications processor products 
this reduction was partially offset by increased service revenues which include ip licensing of our high speed interface technology 
for and  international net revenues were approximately and  respectively  of net revenues 
as of december   our backlog was million  as compared to million as of december  backlog represents firm orders anticipated to be shipped  and service revenue expected to be billed under existing contracts  during the next months 
our business and  to a large extent  that of the entire communication semiconductor industry  is characterized by short term order and shipment schedules 
since orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the option of the purchaser without significant penalty  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of approximately million for as compared to the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of a decrease in net product revenues which was partially offset by higher gross margins on product revenues in the product gross profit was as a percentage of product revenue in as compared to in the total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was and for and  respectively 
the changes in gross margin percentage are mostly attributable to changes in product mix  especially a larger portion of royalties and higher margin ip licensing revenues 
during the years ended december  and  gross profit was affected favorably in the amount of million and million  respectively  from the sales of products that had previously been written down to a cost basis of zero 
also during the years ended december  and  we recorded provisions for excess and obsolete inventories in the amount of million and million  respectively 
these charges had a negative impact on our gross profit 
we anticipate that gross profit will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the volume and mix of our product shipments as well as material costs  yield and the fixed cost absorption of our production operations 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to electronic design automation tools  subcontracting and fabrication costs  depreciation and amortization and facilities expenses 
research and development expenses for were million which increased million  or as compared to the prior year 
this was a result of increased spending in labor  subcontracting and fabrication costs for our high speed interface product line 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  trade shows  travel expenses and facilities expenses 
marketing and sales expenses for were million which decreased million  or as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was a result of lower salaries and employee related expenses due to cost cutting measures that were implemented in these decreases were partially offset by increased sales costs related to our high speed interface product line general and administrative 
general and administrative g a expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  professional and legal fees  and facilities expenses 
g a expenses remained flat at million in as compared to million in restructuring credits charges  net

information on the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles recorded during is located in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense net 
interest expense  net was approximately million in  a decrease of million as compared to interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to lower debt balances resulting from the principal payments made on our notes 
the interest payments on our debt balances were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our notes were paid in full as of september  and as such there will be no interest payments on this debt after that date 
interest income was million in both years ended december  and interest income may fluctuate in the future as a result of changes in market yields due to interest rate fluctuations and changes in our cash and investment balances 
at december  and  the effective interest rates on our interest bearing securities were approximately and  respectively 
other income expense 
for the years ended december  and  we had other income of approximately million and million  respectively 
the other income for was primarily due to both realized and unrealized exchange rate gains and losses which are recorded for the translation of our intercompany loan balances with our wholly owned subsidiaries 
in  we determined that our intercompany loan balances with our foreign subsidiaries are classified as long term 
as such  we recorded exchange gains and losses in the translation of these balances as other comprehensive income or loss for the year ended december  income tax expense 
our income tax expense of million in and million in is applicable to the operating results of certain of our foreign subsidiaries  principally india

our network infrastructure revenues decrease of approximately was a result of lower sales of our lm  cubit d  temx  aspen express and entropia products due to reduced telecom infrastructure capital expenditures in the second half of this was partially offset by increased sales of our ethermap carrier ethernet products  envoy ce and our asic families of products 
our cpe revenues decrease of approximately was attributable to decreased sales of our atlanta products voip communication processors and the ramping down of our mustang gigabit ethernet passive optical product line 
this reduction was partially offset by increased sales from our hdmi products along with increased service revenues which include ip licensing of our high speed interface technology 
for and  international net revenues were approximately and  respectively  of net revenues 
as of december   our backlog was million  as compared to million as of december  backlog represents firm orders anticipated to be shipped  and service revenue expected to be billed under existing contracts  during the next months 
our business and  to a large extent  that of the entire communication semiconductor industry  is characterized by short term order and shipment schedules 
since orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the option of the purchaser without significant penalty  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit decreased by approximately million for as compared to while the gross profit as a percentage of revenue was the same in as it was in the decrease in gross profit is the result of decreased product sales partially offset by increased service revenues 
during the years ended december  and  gross profit was affected favorably in the amount of million and million  respectively  from the sales of products that had previously been written down to a cost basis of zero 
also during the years ended december  and  we recorded provisions for excess and obsolete inventories in the amount of million and million  respectively 
these charges had a negative impact on our gross profit 
we anticipate that gross profit will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the volume and mix of our product shipments as well as material costs  yield and the fixed cost absorption of our production operations 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to electronic design automation tools  subcontracting and fabrication costs  depreciation and amortization and facilities expenses 
research and development expenses for were million which decreased million  or as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was a result of decreased fabrication costs  decreased depreciation  decreased software tool costs and decreases in salaries and employee related costs as a result of workforce reductions  salary reductions and other cost cutting measures that were implemented in and the first quarter of during  expenses were also reduced by approximately million for the reversal of a sales tax accrual for a long outstanding tax issue which was recently adjudicated in our favor 
the matter related to a manufacturing exemption from sales tax which we claimed 
all of these expense reductions were partially offset by increased subcontracting costs as a result of our investment in our high speed interface product line 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  trade shows  travel expenses and facilities expenses 
marketing and sales expenses for were million which decreased million  or as compared to the prior year

information on restructuring charges and credits for and is located in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

information on the impairment of goodwill recorded during is located in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense net 
interest expense  net was approximately million in  a decrease of million as compared to interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to lower debt balances resulting from the principal payments made on our notes 
the interest payments on our debt balances were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income was million in both years ended december  and interest income may fluctuate in the future as a result of changes in market yields due to interest rate fluctuations and changes in our cash and investment balances 
at december  and  the effective interest rates on our interest bearing securities were approximately and  respectively 
other income expense 
for the years ended december  and  we had other income of million and other expense of million  respectively 
the other income and expense was primarily due to both realized and unrealized exchange rate gains and losses which are recorded for the translation of our intercompany loan balances with our wholly owned subsidiaries 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense of million in and million in is applicable to the operating results of certain of our foreign subsidiaries  principally india 
we have incurred significant taxable losses for united states federal and state purposes 
we have not recognized any income tax benefits on those losses because their realization is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of approximately million compared to million as of december  further  our working capital was million as of december  compared to a negative million as of december  our primary source of liquidity is cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  short term investments  a credit facility agreement and sales of our common stock 
we have used cash in our operating activities in each of the last three years  including million in  million in and million in during  we reduced our notes payable from million as of december  to zero as of december  our notes were paid in full as of september  during the year ended december   we completed an offering of shares of common stock that resulted in the sale of  shares  with net proceeds to us of approximately million see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we also entered into an amended and restated business financing agreement the amended financing agreement with bridge bank na bridge bank on april  which amended and restated our existing credit facility 
the amended financing agreement provides us a credit facility of up to million which bears interest at the higher of i the prime rate plus or ii percent  plus the payment of certain fees and expenses the facility 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property  including our accounts receivable and intellectual property 
subject to the terms of the amended financing agreement  availability under the facility is based on a formula pursuant to which bridge bank would advance an amount equal to the lower of million or of our eligible accounts receivable  with account eligibility and advance rates determined by bridge bank in its sole discretion 
the term of the facility is two years and at the expiration of such term  all loan advances under the facility will become immediately due and payable 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
on february   we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement with mlv co 
llc mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock  par value per share  having an aggregate offering price of up to  from time to time through mlv the offering 
also on february   we filed a prospectus supplement with the securities and exchange commission in connection with the offering 
we have taken cost cutting measures through restructuring plans we implemented during and we currently believe that with our anticipated gross profit margins and operating expenses we can break even on an operating income basis  excluding stock compensation costs and amortization of purchased intangibles  at the rate of sales of million per quarter 
also  we intend to continue to assess our cost structure in relationship to our revenue levels and to make appropriate adjustments to expense levels as required 
nonetheless  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  investments  amended financing agreement and at market issuance sales agreement will be sufficient to fund operating activities and capital expenditures  and provide adequate working capital at least through the next twelve months 
if our existing resources  including our amended financing agreement  and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
the sale of equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders  could require us to pledge our intellectual property or other assets to secure the financing  or could impose restrictive covenants on us 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results  and or cause us to sell assets or otherwise restructure our business to remain viable 
commitments and significant contractual obligations we have outstanding operating lease commitments of million  payable over the next six years 
some of these commitments are for space that is not being utilized and  for which we recorded restructuring charges in prior years for excess facilities 
we currently have subleases for the majority of our excess space but our sublease income generated will not offset the entire future commitment 
as of december   we have approximately million in anticipated sub lease income over the next six years relating to portions of our excess facilities 
we currently believe that we can fund these lease commitments in the future 
however  there can be no assurances that we will not be required to seek additional capital or provide additional guarantees or collateral on these obligations 
a summary of our significant future contractual obligations and their payments follows in thousands

payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   we also have pledged approximately million as collateral for stand by letters of credit that guarantee certain long term property lease obligations and to support customer credit requirements 
this million is in our bank accounts and is included in our restricted cash as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements newly issued accounting pronouncements that potentially impact our financial statements are disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we have investments in money market accounts that earn interest income that is a function of the market rates 
as a result  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates were to decrease by one half percentage point from their current levels  our potential interest income for  assuming a constant cash balance  would decrease by less than million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as substantially all of our net revenues are currently made or denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
although we recognize our revenues in us dollars  we incur expenses in currencies other than us dollars 
in  operating expenses incurred in foreign currencies  excluding impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  were approximately of our total operating expenses 
although we have not experienced significant foreign exchange rate losses to date  we may in the future  especially to the extent that we do not engage in hedging 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
fair market value of financial instruments 
our notes were paid in full as of september  and as such we have no exposure relating to these notes as of december
