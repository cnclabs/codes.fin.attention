table of contents part i item business our business about furiex pharmaceuticals we are a drug development collaboration company that uses innovative clinical development strategies to increase the value of partnered pharmaceutical assets and accelerate their development timelines 
we collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to increase the value of their drug candidates by applying our novel approach to drug development  which we believe expedites research and development decision making and can shorten drug development timelines 
we share the risk with our collaborators by running and financing drug development programs up to agreed clinical milestones  and in exchange  we share the potential rewards  receiving milestone and royalty payments for successful drug candidates 
this business model is designed to help feed product pipelines and deliver therapies to improve lives 
our company continues the compound partnering business started by pharmaceutical product development  inc  or ppd  in we became an independent publicly traded company on june   when ppd spun off its compound partnering business through a tax free  pro rata dividend distribution of all of the shares of the company to ppd shareholders 
ppd does not have any ownership or other form of equity interest in the company following the spin off 
the company s operations are headquartered in morrisville  north carolina 
our website address is www

information on our website is not incorporated herein by reference 
we make available free of charge through our website press releases  annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 
business description our goal is to in license from or form strategic alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses to develop and commercialize therapeutics in which the risks and rewards are shared 
we seek to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to increase the value of early stage drug candidates by applying our novel approach to drug development that we believe expedites research and development decision making and can shorten drug development timelines 
furiex s team is staffed with the same key ppd team members who demonstrated proven success in the drug development collaboration business while at ppd  as well as highly qualified additional members 
our strategy is to invest in drug candidates that have a relatively straightforward path to regulatory approval and a large addressable market 
every drug candidate we review is subjected to our rigorous due diligence process by our team of experts who possess experience in all aspects of the drug development process 
once we in license or form an alliance  we use our drug development experience and financial resources to advance the drug candidate through clinical development 
we apply a novel approach that shortens drug development timelines that we believe transforms research and development into revenues more rapidly than the typical development cycle for such collaborations 
specifically  we set the development strategy based on a product candidate s best market position  design and manage non clinical and clinical studies  manage the drug manufacturing programs and evaluate the efficacy and safety data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the drug candidate 
we use service providers to execute the tasks needed to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
most of our collaborations involve late development and commercialization agreements with large pharmaceutical companies 
typically  if our collaborators are unable or unwilling to execute on late stage development and commercialization  then we have the option to seek new collaborators 
in exchange for our drug development efforts and sharing the risk with our collaborator  we are entitled to receive milestone payments and royalties based on the continued development and commercialization success of the drug candidate 

table of contents currently  we have rights to several compounds in various stages of development and commercialization  including rights to royalties and regulatory and sales based milestone payments from takeda pharmaceuticals company limited  for alogliptin and syr takeda received regulatory and pricing approval in japan during the second quarter of for alogliptin for the treatment of type diabetes 
takeda markets alogliptin in japan under the name nesina 
in february  additional indications for nesina were approved in japan including use in combination with two common classes of diabetes drugs  sulfonylureas and biguanides 
in the third quarter of  takeda launched two dosages of liovel  a fixed dose combination tablet of nesina alogliptin and actos pioglitazone hcl  in japan 
in july  takeda announced resubmission of the us ndas for alogliptin and alogliptin in fixed dose combination with pioglitazone 
in september  takeda announced that syr entered phase iii clinical trials in japan for treatment of type diabetes 
rights to royalties and regulatory and sales based milestones from the collaboration with alza corporation  an affiliate of janssen pharmaceutica  nv  for priligy  the first approved treatment in the world for premature ejaculation 
priligy is currently marketed in countries in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
a compound licensed from janssen  an affiliate of johnson johnson  in november that is a mu opioid receptor agonist and delta opioid receptor antagonist  which we call mudelta  for the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome 
we completed a phase ii proof of concept clinical trial during which demonstrated that mudelta has a favorable efficacy and safety profile 
in november  we acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize mudelta under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
a fluoroquinolone antibiotic licensed from janssen in november  which we call jnj q  for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections  such as abscesses that occur deep in the skin layers  and respiratory infections 
in  we completed a phase ii clinical trial using the oral formulation for acute bacterial skin infections reporting positive results 
in late  we halted a community acquired bacterial pneumonia study  ongoing since late  due to challenges in recruiting the study based on the current us food and drug administration  or fda  guidance and recent information that the fda s guidance may change 
in april  we acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize jnj q under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 

table of contents the following chart summarizes the status of our pipeline of compounds logo our solution the drug development industry is under increasing economic pressure to develop new products more quickly and efficiently 
to address this industry issue  we have developed what we believe is a novel approach to drug development 
our approach to drug development involves applying proven solutions from our extensive global drug development experience to reduce development timelines and expedite the decision making cycle  planning for success and bridging steps in development by conducting earlier elements of a program while simultaneously planning for later phases of development 
in order to obtain regulatory approval from the fda to market a drug  certain data about the safety and efficacy of the drug is required 
to obtain such data  drug developers frequently choose to run studies sequentially 
for example  they might run one study  wait to see the results  and then they run the next study 
developers prefer this approach primarily to limit upfront expenditures since the success of any given study is not known and the decision might be made not to move forward due to negative data 
this sequential approach slows down the development process 
we approach drug development by minimizing the time it takes to bring products to the market 
our novel approach manages drug development with parallel processing and efficient decision making 
we use our drug development experience to predict possible outcomes of a study and take risks based on those predictions 
by assuming success at each critical decision point in advance  as opposed to waiting for 
table of contents results  development time is reduced 
in addition  we seek to mitigate risks by contingency planning for potential problems 
as a result  we can accelerate the development process by bridging steps across the developmental program as well as between studies  as was evidenced with alogliptin where it took just months from the filing of the investigational new drug application  or ind  to the filing of the new drug application  or nda 
additionally  we focus our efforts on only those essential studies necessary for regulatory approval 
this helps to shorten developmental timelines 
two key elements to our approach are our due diligence process and our planning for the success of each compound 
before we enter into a collaboration for a compound  we subject it to an intense due diligence review covering every step in the development process  from preclinical and clinical studies through marketing approval 
we generally look for and enter into collaborations with respect to compounds that have the following characteristics address medical conditions with a significant unmet need  a reasonable development time  reasonable predictability of non clinical models  clinical evidence no later than phase ib  a solid patent estate  acceptable estimated cost of goods  and attractive economic terms with the compound s innovator and ultimate commercial collaborator 
if a compound passes our rigorous diligence review hurdles  we then plan the entire development timeline upfront  using a set of assumptions 
part of the upfront planning involves initiating long term studies  such as carcinogenicity studies  earlier than usual 
we also use real time data analysis tools to monitor the clinical study data of a drug candidate 
by initiating long term studies earlier and reviewing data in real time  we can significantly reduce the time needed after the conclusion of clinical studies to complete the necessary documentation for regulatory filing 
we believe this approach works well because the core development team is empowered to make decisions  real time technology tools facilitate rapid data review  development programs are designed to optimize market position and timelines are driven by science and must have studies 
the resulting ability to reduce development timelines in turn allows us to capitalize more quickly on our investment 
we believe our success evolves from our development efficiency 
according to the tufts university center for the study of drug development outlook  since the average time from the filing of an ind to the filing of an nda is over eight years 
by contrast  we advanced alogliptin as a treatment for type diabetes for the monotherapy program from ind to nda in only months 
our business strategy our strategy is to in license and develop novel early stage drug candidates that address medical conditions with a significant unmet need 
we invest in innovative early stage drug candidates whose targets have scientific or clinical validation  and in disease areas that have a relatively straightforward path to regulatory approval 
we leverage our extensive drug development expertise to implement efficient and high quality development programs that accelerate time to market 
we progress drug candidates to key value inflection points and form strategic collaborations with commercial pharmaceutical companies in exchange for milestones and royalties 
each potential drug candidate we consider is subjected to a rigorous review process by our due diligence team  which has expertise in all aspects of drug development  as well as in intellectual property and commercial assessment 
this approach has enabled us to build what we believe is a strong  diversified portfolio of drug candidates and commercialized products that offer value to patients  our investors and collaborators 
we plan to continue to grow our business by in licensing or acquiring promising compounds and establishing new development and commercialization partnerships 

table of contents our portfolio we have two phase iii ready products in clinical development  with exclusive license rights to both products mudelta and jnj q in addition we have one compound in phase iii development with a collaborator  syr  and two compounds that are commercialized by collaborators  for which we are eligible to receive regulatory milestone payments plus worldwide sales royalty and milestone payments 
these compounds  nesina and priligy  are currently marketed outside of the united states  and we have no further development obligations for any of these three compounds 
compounds in clinical development mudelta for diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs d  affects approximately million patients in the united states and the five major european union countries  and is characterized by chronic abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea 
studies have demonstrated that ibs d is associated with work absenteeism  high medical costs and low quality of life 
we believe the market for prescription treatments for ibs d is underserved due to the limited number of available treatments and the adverse side effects associated with those treatments 
mudelta is a novel  orally active  phase iii ready investigational agent with combined mu opioid receptor agonist and delta opioid receptor antagonist activity 
the compound s dual opioid activity is designed to treat diarrhea and pain symptoms of ibs d  without causing the constipating side effects that occur with mu opioid agonists 
mudelta acts locally in the gut and has very low oral bioavailability  thus limiting the potential for systemic side effects  such as sedation 
in january  the fda granted fast track designation to the mudelta ibs d program 
fast track is a process for facilitating the development and expediting the review of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill unmet medical needs  with the goal of bringing important new drugs to patients earlier 
approximately subjects have been treated with mudelta to date 
in  we progressed the development of mudelta from both a developmental and regulatory perspective 
we completed a large multicenter randomized double blind phase ii proof of concept trial in patients with ibs d  which demonstrated that mudelta has a favorable efficacy and safety profile 
we also presented top line data for the study at the american college of gastroenterology meeting 
key findings from the phase ii proof of concept study results are summarized below the study reached statistical significance for the primary endpoint of improvement in stool consistency and abdominal pain at week four of treatment  which was developed prior to the release of the fda s ibs guidance in  as well as secondary endpoints of adequate relief of ibs d symptoms at weeks   and importantly  the favorable efficacy results were obtained in a post hoc responder analysis  using the composite endpoint of improvement in pain and diarrheal symptoms  based on the fda guidance 
using this endpoint where a responder is defined as a patient with a bristol stool score of and daily pain ratings improved by compared to baseline for at least of days of the week treatment period  mudelta showed statistically and clinically meaningful differences compared with placebo at both the mg bid and mg bid doses 
the fda agreed at our end of phase ii meeting  that the aforementioned endpoint is an acceptable primary endpoint for phase iii pivotal studies  we believe this provides a clear regulatory path for progressing the program 
we believe that our favorable phase ii study results with this endpoint bodes well for the phase iii program 
in november  we acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize mudelta under our existing development and license agreement with janssen pharmaceutica  nv  or janssen 
we acquired these rights as a result of janssen s recent decision not to exercise its option under the agreement to continue development of mudelta 
based on our agreement  we will continue developing and commercializing the compound and janssen may receive up to million in regulatory milestone payments and  if approved for marketing  up to million in sales based milestone payments and sales based royalties increasing from the mid to upper single digit percentages as sales volume increases 
royalties are to be paid for a period of ten years after the first commercial sale or  if later  the expiration of the last valid patent claim or the expiration of patent exclusivity 
we are actively exploring various partnering and funding options to advance development of mudelta 
in january  we received favorable written feedback from the fda on the manufacturing program  which enables us to keep program timelines on track 
we are conducting phase iii manufacturing as well as other study start up activities  with the goal of commencing phase iii dosing in the third quarter of we are also in the process of obtaining scientific advice from the european regulatory authorities about a european development strategy for mudelta 

table of contents jnj q community acquired bacterial pneumonia  or cabp  and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections  or absssi  are important public health concerns due to increasing drug resistance of established antibiotics to causative pathogens 
due to the emerging resistance to established antibiotics  there is a large unmet need for antibiotics such as jnj q  that cover a broad range of pathogens  including resistant staphylococcus staph and streptococcus strep  and that have the potential for both intravenous and oral use 
bacterial infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality 
more than million ambulatory physician visits each year are related to skin and soft tissue infections  and approximately  americans developed serious mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus staph aureus infections in  according to a recent study published in the journal of the american medical association 
global microbiological surveillance suggests that approximately of staph infections in the us  latin america and asia pacific are mrsa 
according to global data  the global mrsa market was valued at million in and is projected to exceed billion by the pneumonia therapeutics market was valued at billion in with billion value forecast for due to expected patent expirations 
jnj q is a novel broad spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that also has broad coverage against two important drug resistant pathogens mrsa and drug resistant streptococcus pneumoniae 
in addition  it is highly active against other common and difficult to treat bacteria  including those that are gram negative  gram positive  atypical and anaerobic  and it has a low propensity for drug resistance 
jnj q is also active against resistant pathogens that might be used in bioterrorism and also  in drug resistant gonorrhea 
this broad bactericidal spectrum gives jnj q an advantage over many other antibiotics  which do not reliably treat polymicrobial infections ie  wound infections containing multiple bacterial species or such a wide variety of respiratory pathogens 
we are developing jnj q for both iv and oral use  which differentiates it from many other mrsa treatments  which are available for iv use only 
the product has been in development for both skin infections and pneumonia  with the lead indication being absssi 
in november  we reported positive results for our randomized  double blind  multicenter phase ii clinical trial comparing the efficacy  safety and tolerability of jnj q with linezolid zyvox in a study of patients with absssi receiving oral treatment twice a day with either jnj q or linezolid for to days 
jnj q had positive results for both clinical cure and early response endpoints involving cessation of skin lesion spread or reduction in lesion size and absence of fever within to hours after starting treatment  consistent with the latest fda draft guidance  with a slightly higher response rate for jnj q at than for linezolid at 
these results were published in the december issue of antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy volume pages and are also available on line http aac

in april  we acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize jnj q under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
we acquired rights to jnj q as a result of janssen s decision not to exercise its option under the agreement which gave janssen the opportunity to continue development of jnj q this decision was related to janssen s april announcement that it will be directing its research and development investments toward antivirals and vaccines and would not be investing in new antibacterial therapies 
based on our existing agreement  janssen may receive up to million in regulatory milestone payments  and if approved for marketing  up to million in sales based milestone payments and sales based royalties increasing from the mid to upper single digit percentages as sales volume increases 
royalties would be paid for a period of ten years after the first commercial sale or  if later  the expiration of the last valid patent claim or the expiration of patent exclusivity 
in june and july of  we had productive end of phase ii meetings with both the fda and with several eu regulatory authorities  providing what we believe is a clear regulatory path to support global phase iii development in absssi 
also  a total of peer reviewed scientific papers and abstracts on jnj q were published in 
table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we terminated our study of community acquired bacterial pneumonia prior to full recruitment 
this decision was made for business reasons related to challenges in recruiting the study based on the current fda guidance and recent information that the fda s guidance might change 
the study was a double blind randomized trial where patients with severe community acquired pneumonia received intravenous treatment with jnj q twice daily versus moxifloxacin once daily  and were switched from iv to oral therapy as their conditions improved 
although we enrolled only patients  the data from this small study gives us valuable qualitative information about the drug s efficacy and tolerability in this very ill patient population 
the results were encouraging  with a clinical cure rate primary endpoint of for patients receiving jnj q versus of patients receiving moxifloxacin 
the study was too small  however  to verify statistical significance ie  non inferiority testing 
for the secondary endpoint of clinical stability at day determined by patients vital signs and respiratory status of patients receiving jnj q met the endpoint compared with of patients receiving moxifloxacin 
both the iv and oral formulations of jnj q had favorable tolerability and safety profiles  with no nausea or vomiting reported 
we believe that these phase ii clinical trial data for cabp  taken together with the excellent lung penetration data from our phase i study  support phase iii readiness for a cabp indication 
we believe these data add value to the asset  in that the phase iii readiness of jnj q for two indications may provide a competitive advantage over other antibiotics in the development pipeline 
we indicated in the fourth quarter of that we were invited to submit a government contract proposal for research funding of jnj q to the biomedical advanced research and development authority  or barda 
although we had a productive pre proposal meeting with barda  we have elected not to proceed with a contract proposal at present  because of limitations in government funding to support phase iii development 
we are continuing to seek to out license jnj q we plan to maintain the phase iii readiness of the program  which should require minimal expenditures during we believe this drug has the potential to be valuable broad spectrum therapy for serious skin and lung infections 
ppd statin compound in december  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ranbaxy laboratories  ltd  or ranbaxy  for rights to ppd as a potential treatment for dyslipidemia  a condition characterized by high cholesterol 
in december  we announced top line results from the phase ii trial of the investigational drug ppd in patients with a history of statin associated myalgia  or sam 
ppd did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint in this study 
based on these results  we have made a decision to discontinue further spending on the ppd program and plan to terminate our license agreement with ranbaxy in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as part of the agreement  we will owe ranbaxy a million development milestone payment upon completion of the phase ii final study report  which we anticipate will occur in the second quarter of 
table of contents marketed products nesina alogliptin for type ii diabetes globally  as of  it is estimated that there are million people with diabetes 
type diabetes comprises about of the total cases of diabetes 
worldwide sales of anti diabetic treatments in were billion 
nesina  which is marketed by takeda pharmaceuticals company limited  or takeda  is the trade name for alogliptin  a member of a relatively new class of drugs for the oral treatment of type diabetes 
nesina is a highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase  or dpp  inhibitor that slows the inactivation of hormones known as incretins  which play a major role in regulating blood sugar levels and might improve pancreatic function 
pivotal trials demonstrated that nesina was well tolerated when given as a single daily dose and it significantly improved glycemic control in type diabetes patients without raising the incidence of hypoglycemia 
additionally  nesina has been shown to enhance glycemic control when used in combination with other commonly prescribed diabetes drugs 
we continue to see increasing sales of nesina in japan  with royalty revenues growing more than over each of the last two quarters 
nesina was approved in japan as monotherapy for type diabetes in in february  additional indications for nesina were approved in japan for use in combination with sulfonylureas and use in combination with biguanides 
in the third quarter of  takeda launched two dosages of liovel  a fixed dose combination tablet of nesina alogliptin and actos pioglitazone hcl  in japan 
in july  takeda announced resubmission of the us ndas for alogliptin and alogliptin in fixed dose combination with pioglitazone and a prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  action date of january  was assigned by the fda 
on november   takeda announced that the pdufa action date was delayed until april  if us approval is granted  we would be eligible to receive a million milestone payment as well as royalties and sales based milestones 
also  takeda announced that it had submitted an nda in the us for a fixed dose combination of alogliptin and metformin  and that this application has a pdufa action date in december syr is part of the dpp inhibitor portfolio that takeda purchased from ppd and syrrx in syr has the same mechanism of action as alogliptin 
however  in contrast to alogliptin  which is a once daily oral therapy  syr is a once weekly oral formulation  which offers potential for greater convenience for diabetes patients 
on september   takeda announced that syr entered phase iii clinical trials in japan for treatment of type diabetes 
if syr is approved  then we would be eligible to receive royalty payments at the same rates as for nesina 
under our agreement with takeda  we would be entitled to receive milestone payments for syr or nesina  whichever compound achieves the milestone s first 
under our agreement with takeda  we will be entitled to receive up to million in future regulatory milestone payments million for us approval  million on regulatory filing for marketing authorization in the eu and million for eu marketing authorization  and up to million in sales based milestone payments 
in addition  we are entitled to receive payments on worldwide sales of nesina based on royalty rates of to in the us  to in europe and japan and to in regions other than the us  europe or japan 
these royalty payments are subject to a reduction of up to for a portion of payments by takeda to a licensor for intellectual property related to nesina 
royalties are to be paid for the later of ten years following the first commercial sale or two years following the expiration of the last to expire patent 
takeda must pay us royalties for liovel sales based on the proportion of nesina s average sales price compared to that of pioglitazone plus nesina 
we have no further financial obligation under this agreement 

table of contents priligy dapoxetine for premature ejaculation priligy is the trade name for dapoxetine  a drug in tablet form specifically indicated for the on demand treatment of premature ejaculation  or pe 
it is the first oral medication to be approved for this condition 
the reported percentage of men affected with pe at some point during their lives ranges from to  depending on the methodology and criteria used 
priligy is a unique  short acting  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  or ssri  designed to be taken only when needed  one to three hours before sexual intercourse  rather than every day 
priligy has been studied in five randomized  placebo controlled phase iii clinical trials involving more than  men with pe and is marketed in countries in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
additional clinical studies are being conducted on priligy in the us and abroad 
we are enthusiastic about the potential for priligy ex us  however  we cannot assure that the drug will be approved in the united states 
we are actively evaluating and pursuing the possibility of restructuring the existing agreement with alza corporation  or alza  for priligy  with the possibility of involving another collaborative partner 
any transaction might require that the company negotiate additional out licenses or collaborations  and could require additional external sources of financing 
we acquired priligy from eli lilly and company  or lilly  and out licensed it to alza  and it is currently being marketed by alza s affiliate janssen 
under our license agreement with alza  we have the right to receive up to million in additional regulatory milestone payments  up to million in sales based milestone payments  and sales based royalties ranging from to for sales of patented products without generic competition and ranging from to for non patented products without generic competition  in both cases the percentages rise as sales volumes increase  and a royalty of for patented and non patented products with generic competition regardless of sales volume based on the level of priligy sales worldwide 
we are obligated to pay lilly a royalty of on annual sales in excess of million 
priligy has been marketed in seven european countries since germany  spain  italy  portugal  finland  sweden and austria 
in january  the european commission endorsed the positive opinion adopted by the committee for human medicinal products for priligy dapoxetine mg and mg doses 
pending national approvals  the marketing authorization for the priligy doses can be granted in the european union member states where the drug has not yet been approved including the united kingdom and france  as well as in norway and iceland 

table of contents our drug development capabilities the drug development capabilities of our executive officer team embodies over years of research and development experience 
this experience includes a deep understanding of the biological causes of human diseases and the factors that impact all aspects of successful drug development such as manufacturing  formulation  the cause of drug side effects  drug interactions and drug pharmacokinetics 
we believe that our drug development capability and proven success rate will continue to provide a pipeline of unique compounds 
depending upon the availability of our development resources  our preclinical candidates might be added to our own internal clinical pipeline  or out licensed to other companies for clinical development and commercialization 
our patents and other proprietary rights patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
it is our policy to seek patent protection for our assets  and also to rely upon trade secrets  know how and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we own or have exclusively licensed issued us patents and have approximately us and us pending patent applications 
we have a policy to seek worldwide patent protection for our products and have foreign patent rights corresponding to most of our us patents 
we license the rights to the following material patents related to our product candidates mudelta 
licensed from janssen 
the license continues as long as we meet our obligations to janssen and we have marketing rights to the compound 
as of december   us and foreign patents have been issued to janssen in this patent family 
additional us and foreign patent applications are still pending 
jnj q licensed from janssen 
the license continues as long as we meet our obligations to janssen and we have marketing rights to the compound 
as of december   us and foreign patents have been issued to janssen in this patent family 
additional us and foreign patent applications are still pending 
pursuant to the terms of the uruguay round agreements act  patents issued from applications filed on or after june   have a term of years from the date of filing  no matter how long it takes for the patent to 
table of contents issue 
because patent applications in the pharmaceutical industry often take a long time to issue  this method of patent term calculation can result in a shorter period of patent protection afforded to us compared to the prior method of term calculation  which was years from the date of issue 
our issued us patents expire between and  excluding any potential patent term extension available under us federal law 
we actively seek full patent term adjustment following allowance of a patent 
we also actively seek patent term extensions following marketing approval 
under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of and the generic animal drug and patent term restoration act of  a patent that claims a product  use or method of manufacture covering drugs may be extended for up to five years to compensate the patent holder for a portion of the time required for fda review 
while we file and prosecute patent applications to protect our inventions  our pending patent applications might not result in the issuance of patents or our issued patents might not provide competitive advantages 
also  our patent protection might not prevent others from developing competitive products using related or other technology 
in addition to seeking the protection of patents and licenses  we also rely upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovation  which we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  suppliers and licensees 
the scope  enforceability and effective term of issued patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims in pharmaceutical patents  so that even issued patents might later be modified or revoked by the relevant patent authorities or courts 
moreover  the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with similar claim scope in another country  and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries  so we are unable to predict the extent of patent protection in any country 
the patents we obtain and the unpatented proprietary technology we hold might not afford us significant commercial protection 
additional information regarding risks associated with our patents and other proprietary rights that affect our business is contained under the headings we must protect our patents and other intellectual property rights to succeed and we might need to obtain patent licenses from others in order to manufacture or sell our potential products and we might not be able to obtain these licenses on terms acceptable to us or at all under the heading risk factors 
manufacturing and supply we currently rely on our collaborators and contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices  with oversight by our internal managers 
we plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our drug candidates if and when approved for marketing by the applicable regulatory agency 
we generally rely on one manufacturer for the active pharmaceutical ingredient and another manufacturer for the formulated drug product for each of our drug candidate programs 
at the early stage of clinical studies  we do not believe that we are substantially dependent on any supplier  or that additional manufacturers would be beneficial due the possibility of changes in the method of manufacturing of the drug candidate 
as a drug candidate moves to later stages of development and the drug formulation method is established  we then seek additional manufacturers for the drug 
sales and marketing we currently have no marketing  sales or distribution capabilities 
we plan to rely on third party collaborators to market our products  like alza for priligy and takeda for nesina and related products  and therefore we are subject to the strategic marketing decisions of such third parties 
we generally plan to out license our commercial rights 
table of contents in a territory to a third party with marketing  sales and distribution capabilities in exchange for one or more of the following up front payments  research funding  development funding  milestone payments  and royalties on drug sales 
in some instances  however  we might choose to develop our own staff for marketing  sales or distribution 
government regulation the manufacturing  testing  labeling  approval and storage of our products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries at the federal  state and local level  including the fda 
the process of obtaining approval for a new pharmaceutical product or for additional therapeutic indications within this regulatory framework requires expenditure of substantial resources and usually takes several years 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  including us  have suffered significant setbacks in various stages of clinical trials  even in advanced clinical trials after promising results had been obtained in earlier trials 
the process for obtaining fda approval of drug candidates customarily begins with the filing of an ind with the fda for the use of a drug candidate to treat a particular indication 
if the ind is accepted by the fda  we would then start human clinical trials to determine  among other things  the proper dose  safety and efficacy of the drug candidate in the stated indication 
the clinical trial process is customarily divided into three phases phase i  phase ii and phase iii 
each successive phase is generally larger and more time consuming and expensive than the preceding phase 
throughout each phase we are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the fda 
even after a drug is approved and being marketed for commercial use  the fda may require that we conduct additional trials  including phase iv trials  to further study safety or efficacy 
as part of the regulatory approval process  we must demonstrate to the fda the ability to manufacture a pharmaceutical product before we receive marketing approval 
we and our manufacturing collaborators must conform to rigorous standards regarding manufacturing and quality control procedures in order to receive fda approval 
the validation of these procedures is a costly endeavor 
pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to inspections by the fda and local authorities as well as inspections by authorities of other countries 
to supply pharmaceutical products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturers must comply with these fda approved guidelines 
these foreign manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by corresponding regulatory agencies in these countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
moreover  state  local and other authorities may also regulate pharmaceutical product manufacturing facilities 
before we are able to manufacture commercial products  we or our contract manufacturer  as the case may be  must meet fda guidelines 
both before and after marketing approval is obtained  a pharmaceutical product  its manufacturer and the holder of the biologics license application  or bla  or nda for the pharmaceutical product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight 
the fda may deny approval to a bla or nda if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied 
moreover  even if regulatory approval is granted  such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the pharmaceutical product 
further  marketing approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems with the pharmaceutical product occur following approval 
in addition  under a bla or nda  the manufacturer of the product continues to be subject to facility inspections and the applicant must assume responsibility for compliance with applicable pharmaceutical product and establishment standards 
violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences  which may include  among other adverse actions  withdrawal of the previously approved pharmaceutical product or marketing approvals or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer or bla or nda holder 
for the development of pharmaceutical products outside the united states  we and our collaborators are subject to foreign regulatory requirements and the ability to market a drug is contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of 
table of contents clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
in countries other than european union countries  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level 
within the european union  procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
clinical trial applications must be filed with the relevant regulatory authority in each country in which we would want to conduct a clinical trial 
assuming approval and the success of any clinical trial  we would then need to seek marketing approval for the drug 
the process for obtaining marketing approval of drug candidates in the european union begins with the filing with the european medicines agency  or ema  of a marketing authorization application  or maa  for the use of a drug candidate to treat a particular indication 
similar processes and outcomes of such human clinical trials that are required by the fda are also required by the ema including testing for dose  safety and efficacy in three phases 
similar to the fda  we are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the european regulators throughout each phase 
even after a drug is approved and being marketed for commercial use  the ema may require that we conduct additional trials  including phase iv trials  to further study safety or efficacy 
as a result  the ema regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
if and when necessary  we will choose the appropriate route of european or other international regulatory filing to accomplish the most rapid regulatory approvals 
requirements relating to manufacturing  conduct of clinical trials and product licensing vary widely in different countries  and the chosen regulatory strategy might not secure regulatory approvals or approvals of our chosen product indications 
in addition  if a particular product to be used outside of the united states is manufactured in the united states  fda requirements and us export provisions will apply 
outside of the united states  many countries require us to obtain pricing approval in addition to regulatory approval prior to launching the product in the approving country 
we or our licensees may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs or price controls in our respective efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals 
failure to obtain pricing approval in a timely manner or approval of pricing which would support an adequate return on investment or generate a sufficient margin to justify the economic risk might delay or prohibit the commercial launch of the product in those countries 
the marketing and sale of approved pharmaceutical product is subject to strict regulation 
promotional materials and activities must comply with the approving agency s regulations and other guidelines 
physicians may prescribe pharmaceutical or biologic products for uses that are not described in a product s labeling or differ from those approved by the approving agency 
while such off label uses are common and regulatory agencies do not regulate physicians choice of treatments  many approving agencies restrict a company s communications on the subject of off label use 
companies cannot promote approved pharmaceutical or biologic products for off label uses 
if any advertising or promotional activities we undertake fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines regarding off label use  we may be subject to warnings or enforcement action 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors are worldwide conglomerates with substantially greater resources than we have to develop and commercialize their drugs and drug candidates 
potential competitors have developed and are developing compounds for treating the same indications as our product candidates 
in addition  a number of academic and commercial organizations are actively pursuing similar technologies  and several companies have developed or may develop technologies that might compete with our compounds 
priligy  indicated for premature ejaculation  competes with cromadyn  a generic paroxetine sold by more pharmaceuticals in mexico 
additional competition includes off label treatment with chronically dosed ssris eg paroxetine  fluoxetine

competitors might succeed in more rapidly developing and marketing technologies and products that are more effective than our products or that would render our products or technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
our collaborators might also independently develop products that are competitive with products that we have licensed to them 
any product that we or our collaborators succeed in developing and for which regulatory approval is obtained must then compete for market acceptance and market share 
the relative speed with which we and our collaborators can develop products  complete clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market compared to competitive companies will affect market success 
in addition  the amount of marketing and sales resources  and the effectiveness of the marketing used with respect to a product will affect its success 
in addition  some clinical research organizations  or cro  service providers and private equity funds are developing risk sharing models to finance the pharmaceutical industry s pipeline 
novaquest  a subsidiary of quintiles transnational  is active in this business 
as these types of business models evolve  there will be increasing competition for compounds and funds that will affect our ability to add to our portfolio 

table of contents other competitive factors affecting our business generally include product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product availability  marketing and sales capabilities  reimbursement coverage  the amount of clinical benefit of our product candidates relative to their cost  method of and frequency of administration of any of our product candidates which may be commercialized  patent protection of our product candidates  the capabilities of our collaborators  and the ability to hire qualified personnel 
employees we have full time employees  a majority of whom are engaged in research and development activities 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors our business operations face a number of risks 
these risks should be read and considered with other information provided in this report 
risks relating to furiex s business we anticipate that we will incur additional losses 
we might never achieve or sustain profitability 
if additional capital is not available  we might have to curtail or cease operations 
our business has experienced significant net losses 
we had net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the results for and included aggregate milestone payments of million and million  respectively 
we did not receive any milestone payments during we will continue to incur additional net losses  as we continue our research and development activities and incur significant preclinical and clinical development costs  until revenues from all sources reach a level sufficient to support our ongoing operations 
because we or our collaborators or licensees might not successfully develop additional products  obtain required regulatory approvals  manufacture products at an acceptable cost or with appropriate quality  or successfully market products with desired margins  our expenses might continue to exceed any revenues we receive 
our commitment of resources to the continued development of our products might require significant additional funds for development 
our operating expenses also might increase if we move our earlier stage potential products into later stage clinical development  which is generally a more expensive stage of development  encounter problems during clinical development that require a change in scope and or timelines resulting in higher costs  pursue clinical development of our potential products in new indications  increase the number of patents we are prosecuting or otherwise expend additional resources on patent prosecution or defense  invest in or acquire additional technologies  product candidates or businesses  although we have no current agreements to do so  or impair any of our investments in our product candidates 

table of contents in the absence of substantial licensing  milestone and other revenues from third party collaborators  royalties on sales of products licensed under our intellectual property rights  future revenues from our products in development or other sources of revenues  we will continue to incur operating losses and might require additional capital to fully execute our business strategy 
the likelihood of reaching  and time required to reach  sustained profitability are highly uncertain 
although we expect that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations and working capital requirements for at least the next months based on current operating plans  we might need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our research and development programs  acquire complementary businesses or technologies  respond to competitive pressures  or commercialize our product candidates 
our future capital needs depend on many factors  including the scope  duration and expenditures associated with our research and development programs  continued scientific progress in these programs  the outcome of potential licensing transactions  if any  competing technological developments  our proprietary patent position  if any  in our product candidates  the regulatory approval process for our product candidates  and the cost of attracting and retaining employees 
we might seek to raise necessary funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional collaborations and licensing arrangements 
we might not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
general market conditions might make it difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets 
we might have to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us  in order to raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we might have to delay  reduce or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs and reduce overhead expenses  or restructure or cease operations 
these actions might reduce the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our near term revenue is largely dependent on the success of nesina and priligy as well as our other drug candidates  and we cannot be certain that our collaborators will be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of these drug candidates 
we currently are relying on nesina and priligy to generate revenue 
while priligy is approved for marketing outside of the us  it has not been approved in the us and the fda issued a not approvable letter to our collaborative partner at the time  janssen  in october we are investigating regulatory strategies for a potential refiling with the fda 
while nesina is approved for marketing in japan  takeda  our collaborative partner  continues to seek approval in the us and europe 
takeda is performing a cardiovascular safety trial for alogliptin and has refiled its nda with the fda 
a decision by the fda is expected in the second quarter of the data from this cardiovascular safety trial might also impact the approval of nesina by the ema 
we have also invested a significant amount of time and financial resources in the development of jnj q fda guidance for developing drugs to treat community acquired bacterial pneumonia includes challenging requirements for the drug developer 
our future success might depend on our collaborator s ability to successfully complete the phase iii trial for this pneumonia indication using jnj q in view of the fda guidelines 
we have also invested a significant amount of time and financial resources in the development of mudelta 
our future success might depend on our or our collaborator s ability to successfully complete phase iii clinical trials for mudelta 
we anticipate that our success will depend largely on the receipt of regulatory approval and successful commercialization of these drug candidates 
the future success of these drug candidates will depend on several factors  including the following our ability to provide acceptable evidence of their safety and efficacy  receipt of marketing approval from the fda and any similar foreign regulatory authorities  obtaining and maintaining commercial manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers or establishing commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  collaborating with pharmaceutical companies or contract sales organizations to further develop  market and sell any approved drug  acceptance of any approved drug in the medical community and by patients and third party payors  and successful review of the alogliptin nda by the fda leading to a marketing authorization 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue generating revenues through the sale of priligy or nesina or generate any revenue from the sale of other product candidates 
our ability to continue to develop and commercialize our late stage product candidates depends on our ability to find new collaborators 
our ability to succeed in our drug development business by advancing our late stage product candidates through phase iii clinical trials will depend on our ability to successfully find collaborators able to fund and execute late stage development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we generally conduct our drug development business in two stages 
during the first stage  we in license a product candidate from a collaborator and develop that candidate through phase ii clinical trials 
if the product candidate successfully completes phase ii testing  we enter a second stage during which we seek a collaborator  which might be the same collaborator as in the first stage  for the continued late stage development and ultimate commercialization of the product candidate 
janssen  our original collaborator for jnj q and mudelta  has elected not to continue development of these two product candidates 
if we cannot find a collaborator for final development and commercialization  we might not be able to complete the development and commercialization on our own due to the significant costs associated with these activities 
as a result  we may not be able to recoup all or any part of our investment in the product candidate 

table of contents our milestone and royalty payments from collaborators and the successful development and marketing of our product candidates depends on our collaborators continuing to develop and commercialize the product candidates 
if our collaborators are not successful or choose not to develop these compounds  we might not receive future payment 
the drug development industry is under increasing economic pressure 
the third parties with which we collaborate might not perform their obligations as expected or they might breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully or in a timely manner 
further  parties collaborating with us who elect to develop a drug candidate might not devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  regulatory strategy and approvals  marketing or sale of these product candidates 
if the parties to our collaborative agreements do not fulfill their obligations  elect not to develop a candidate or fail to devote sufficient resources to it  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  our ability to further develop potential products could be severely limited 
while we generally seek non compete terms in our agreements with our collaborators for the products we are developing  the enforcement of a non compete can be expensive and difficult to monitor and enforce and might be subject to being invalidated by a court or judge 
we have agreements under which we rely on collaborators to manufacture our product candidates and essential components for those product candidates  design and conduct clinical trials  compile and analyze the data received from these trials  obtain regulatory approvals and  if approved  market these products 
as a result  we may have limited or no control over the manufacturing  development and marketing of these potential products 
in addition  the performance of our collaborators might not be sufficient or appropriate for regulatory review and approval for our product candidates 
further  we often rely on one manufacturer or other collaborator for such services  the loss of which could significantly delay the development of any of our product candidates 
our milestone and royalty payments rely on the performance of our collaborators and would be impacted by any delay or termination by our collaborators 
our collaborators can terminate our collaborative agreements under certain conditions 
a collaborator may terminate its agreement with us or separately pursue alternative products  therapeutic approaches or technologies as a means of developing treatments for the diseases targeted by us  or our collaborative effort 
even if a collaborator continues to contribute to the arrangement  it might nevertheless decide not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products 
in these circumstances  our ability to further develop potential products could be severely limited 
while we generally seek non compete terms in our agreements with our collaborators for the products we are developing  the enforcement of a non compete can be expensive and difficult to monitor and enforce and might be subject to being invalidated by a court or judge 
continued funding and participation by collaborators will depend on the continued timely achievement of our research and development objectives  the retention of key personnel performing work under those agreements and on each collaborator s own financial  competitive  marketing and strategic capabilities and priorities 
these considerations include the commitment of each collaborator s management to the continued development of the licensed products or technology  the relationships among the individuals responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the development efforts  and the relative advantages of alternative products or technology being marketed or developed by each collaborator or by others  including their relative patent and proprietary technology positions  and their ability to manufacture potential products successfully 
the willingness of our existing collaborators to continue development of our potential products and our ability to enter into new relationships depends upon  among other things  our patent position with respect to such products 
if we are unable to successfully obtain and maintain patents  we might be unable to collect royalties on existing licensed products or enter into additional agreements 

table of contents in addition  our collaborators might independently develop products that are competitive with products that we have licensed to them 
this could reduce our revenues or the likelihood of achieving revenues under our agreements with these collaborators 
if we are unable to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our drug candidates or are unable to establish our own sales and marketing capabilities  we might be unable to generate product revenue 
we do not currently have the resources to sell  market or distribute any pharmaceutical products 
in order to market any of our products that receive regulatory approval  we must make arrangements with third parties to perform these services  or build our sales  marketing  managerial and other non technical capabilities 
if we are unable to do so  we might not be able to generate product revenue and might not become profitable 
we might obtain future financing through the issuance of debt or equity or other forms of financing  which might have an adverse effect on our shareholders or otherwise adversely affect our business 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity or other forms of financing  any debt securities or preferred stock issued will have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of liquidation 
in such event  there is a possibility that once all senior claims are settled  there might be no assets remaining to pay out to the holders of our common stock 
in addition  if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity  whether through private placements or public offerings  such an issuance would dilute the ownership of our then current shareholders 
the terms of debt securities might also impose restrictions on our operations  which might include limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock  or to make certain acquisitions or investments 
in addition  we might be subject to covenants requiring us to satisfy certain financial tests and ratios  and our ability to satisfy such covenants may be affected by events outside of our control 
our operating expenses and results and any revenue likely will fluctuate in future periods 
our revenues and expenses are unpredictable and likely will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to  among other things  the timing and the unpredictable nature of clinical trials and related expenses  including payments owed by us and to us under collaborative agreements for reimbursement of expenses  future milestone revenues under collaborative agreements  sales of priligy and nesina and any future sales of other products 
in addition  the recognition of clinical trial and other expenses that we otherwise would recognize over a period of time under applicable accounting principles might be accelerated or expanded in certain circumstances 
in such a case  it might cause our expenses during that period to be higher than they otherwise would have been had the circumstances not occurred 
for example  if we terminate a clinical trial for which we paid non refundable upfront fees to a clinical research organization and in which we did not accrue all of the patient costs  the recognition of the expense associated with those fees that we were recognizing as we accrued patient costs would be accelerated and recognized in the period in which the termination occurred 
we are dependent on the performance of service providers 
we rely on service providers  such as contract manufacturers  clinical research organizations  medical institutions and clinical investigators  including physician sponsors  to conduct nearly all of our clinical trials  including recruiting and enrolling patients in the trials 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a master development services agreement with ppd pursuant to which ppd provides us clinical development services at discounted rates on a preferred provider basis 
if ppd or any of these other parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we might be delayed or may not obtain regulatory approval for or be able to commercialize our product candidates 
if any of the third parties upon whom we rely to conduct our clinical trials do not comply with applicable laws  successfully carry out their obligations or meet expected deadlines  our clinical trials might be extended  delayed or terminated 

table of contents if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data obtained by third party contractors is compromised due to their failure to adhere to applicable laws or our clinical protocols  or for other reasons  we might not obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize any of our product candidates 
if our relationship with any of these organizations or individuals terminates  replacing any of these third parties could delay our clinical trials and could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
risks relating to our operations we might not successfully operate the compound partnering business as an independent entity 
it takes many years for a drug development business like ours to generate revenue and income 
although we have experience operating our compound partnering business within ppd s discovery sciences segment since  we might not be successful in operating this business as a stand alone company 
generating revenue and income  consistently or at all  from our drug development business and compound partnering activities depends on our ability to develop products internally or obtain rights to them from others on favorable terms  successfully complete non clinical and clinical studies  obtain clinical trial materials of sufficient quality or quantity  obtain and maintain intellectual property rights to these products  obtain and maintain regulatory approvals  enter into agreements with third parties to continue the development and commercialization of drug candidates  and enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture products on our behalf and to provide sales and marketing functions 
we must attract and retain key employees in order to succeed 
to be successful  our unique business model requires that our personnel have extensive experience in designing and implementing drug development programs that will run faster than typical studies in the industry 
we also require qualified personnel  experienced at building and maintaining relationships with our collaborators 
we rely on the services of our senior management  particularly our president and chief medical officer  june almenoff  our senior vice president research  gail mcintyre  and our senior vice president clinical operations  paul covington  as well as our chief financial officer  marshall woodworth  our vice president legal affairs  nadine chien  and our vice president strategic development  sailash patel  the loss of any of whom could adversely impact our operations 
we do not carry key man insurance on any of these individuals or any of our other officers or employees 
any inability to hire additional qualified personnel might also require an increase in the workload for both existing and new personnel 
we might not be successful in attracting new scientists or management  or in retaining or motivating our existing personnel 
the shortage of experienced scientists and managers capable of working within our unique business model might lead to increased recruiting  relocation and compensation costs for these professionals  which might exceed our forecasts 
if we are unable to attract and retain any of these personnel  our ability to execute our business plan will be adversely affected 
if our product identification efforts are not successful  we might not be able to effectively develop new products 
our product candidates are in various stages of development 
some or all of our product candidates might never be developed for any number of reasons  including failure to meet clinical trial tests and failure to receive regulatory approval 
for example  we suspended our ppd 
table of contents program due to unfavorable efficacy data from the phase ii clinical trial 
to maintain our business  we need to have a sufficient pipeline of product candidates 
our success in identifying new product candidates depends upon our ability to identify and validate new targets through in licensing or collaborative arrangements 
in order to increase the possibilities of identifying compounds with a reasonable chance for success in clinical studies  part of our business strategy is to identify a higher number of potential targets than we expect to be able to progress through clinical development 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to identify or obtain rights to new product candidates that lead to the required regulatory approvals and the successful commercialization of products  our business could be harmed 
many of our drug candidates are in development and we or our collaborators might not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 
the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
government approvals are required to develop  market and sell the potential drug candidates we develop alone or with others under our risk sharing arrangements 
especially for the early stage compounds we target for in licensing  obtaining government approval to develop  market and sell drug candidates is time consuming and expensive 
further  clinical trial results for a particular drug candidate might not satisfy requirements to obtain government approvals 
for example  in late  janssen  our collaborator at the time on dapoxetine  received a not approvable letter from the fda 
in addition  governmental approvals might not be received in a timely manner  if at all  and we and our collaborative partners might not be able to meet other regulatory requirements for our products 
for example  in late  the fda notified takeda that it would not be able to complete its review of the alogliptin nda before the prescription drug use fee act date due to the lack of internal resources 
in addition  requirements for government approval to market and sell drug candidates are subject to change 
for example  the division of endocrinologic and metabolic drug products in the center for drug evaluation and research decided that concerns about cardiovascular risk should be more thoroughly addressed during drug development programs  and  in december  issued final guidance on the topic titled guidance for industry diabetes mellitus evaluating cardiovascular risk in new antidiabetic therapies to treat type diabetes 
as a result  in june and september  the fda issued complete responses to takeda on its ndas for the alogliptin monotherapy and the fixed dose combination of alogliptin and actos requesting an additional cardiovascular safety trial on alogliptin prior to further regulatory review 
finally  even if we are successful in obtaining all required approvals to market and sell a drug candidate  post approval requirements and the failure to comply with other regulations could result in suspension or limitation of government approvals 
in connection with drug development activities outside the united states  we and our collaborators will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing the testing  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
these requirements vary from country to country 
even if approval has been obtained for a product in the united states  approvals in foreign countries must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries 
the approval process in foreign countries may be more or less rigorous and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the united states 
clinical studies conducted outside of any particular country may not be accepted by that country  and the approval of a pharmaceutical product in one country does not assure that the product will be approved in another country 
the failure to gain market acceptance of our product candidates among the medical community would adversely affect our revenue 
even if approved  our product candidates might not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community 
we might not achieve market acceptance even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy and we obtain the necessary regulatory and reimbursement approvals 
the degree of market acceptance of any product candidates that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  
table of contents cost effectiveness of our product candidates versus competing products  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods  pricing requirements in various markets  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and marketing and distribution support for our product candidates  including the efforts of our collaborators where they have marketing and distribution responsibilities 
physicians will not recommend our products until clinical data or other factors demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product as compared to conventional drug and other treatments 
even if we establish the clinical safety and efficacy of our product candidates  physicians might elect not to use our product for any number of other reasons  including whether the mode of administration of our products is effective for certain indications 
the failure of our product candidates to achieve significant market acceptance would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition 
we face significant competition  including from entities that have substantially greater resources and more experience in the commercialization and marketing of pharmaceuticals than we have 
potential competitors in the united states and other countries include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical companies 
these entities have developed and are developing compounds that might compete with our products in development 
these competitors might succeed in more rapidly developing and marketing technologies and products that are more effective than our product candidates or technologies or that would render any future commercialized products or technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
our product candidates and any future commercialized products might also face significant competition from both brand name and generic manufacturers that could adversely affect any future sales of our products 
any product that we or our collaborators succeed in developing and for which regulatory approval is obtained must then compete for market acceptance and market share 
the relative speed with which we and our collaborators can develop products  complete the clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market compared to competitive companies will affect market success 
in addition  the amount of marketing and sales resources and the effectiveness of the marketing used with respect to a product will affect its marketing success 
other factors affecting the ability of our products to compete include their efficacy and safety  the manner and frequency of their administration  and the extent of any reimbursement coverage 
in addition  some cro services providers and private equity funds are developing risk sharing models to finance the pharmaceutical industry s pipeline 
as these types of business models evolve  there will be increasing competition for compounds and funds to develop those compounds 
we must protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to succeed 
our success is dependent in significant part on our ability to develop and protect patent and other intellectual property rights and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
our pending patent applications might not result in the issuance of valid patents or the claim scope of our issued patents may not provide competitive advantages 
also  our patent protection might not prevent others from developing competitive products using related or other technology that does not infringe our patent rights 
in addition  our patent for priligy is for method of use and not composition of matter 
further  patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing 
we therefore might not know that a competitor has filed a patent application covering subject matter similar to subject matter in one of our patent applications or that we were the first to invent the innovation we seek to patent 
this might lead to disputes including interference proceeding or litigation to determine rights to patentable subject matter 
these disputes are often expensive and might result in our being unable to patent an innovation 

table of contents the scope  enforceability and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings 
no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents  so that even issued patents might later be modified or revoked by the relevant patent authorities or courts 
these proceedings could be expensive  last several years and either prevent issuance of additional patents to us or result in a significant reduction in the scope or invalidation of our patents 
any limitation in claim scope could reduce our ability to negotiate future collaborative research and development agreements based on these patents 
moreover  the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with similar claim scope in another country  and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries  so we are unable to predict the extent of patent protection in any country 
in certain cases  we are reliant on our collaborator to file  negotiate and maintain patents covering a licensed product 
our collaborators may fail to adequately obtain and maintain such patents 
in addition to seeking the protection of patents and licenses  we also rely upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  suppliers and licensees 
if these agreements are not honored  we might not have adequate remedies for any breach 
additionally  our trade secrets might otherwise become known or patented by our competitors 
we might need to obtain patent licenses from others in order to manufacture or sell our potential products and we might not be able to obtain these licenses on terms acceptable to us or at all 
other companies  universities and research institutions might obtain patents that could limit our ability to use  import  manufacture  market or sell our products or impair our competitive position 
as a result  we might need to obtain licenses from others before we could continue using  importing  manufacturing  marketing  or selling our products 
we might not be able to obtain required licenses on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we do not obtain required licenses  we might encounter significant delays in product development while we redesign potentially infringing products or methods or we might not be able to market our products at all 
we or our collaborators might not be able to attract a sufficient number of sites or enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely manner in order to complete our clinical trials 
the rate of completion of clinical trials is significantly dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including changing regulatory requirements  the size of the patient population  perceived risks and benefits of the drug under study  availability of competing therapies  including those in clinical development  availability of clinical drug supply  participation of qualified clinical trial sites  availability and willingness of potential participants to enroll in clinical trials  design of the protocol  proximity of and access by patients to clinical sites  patient referral practices of physicians  eligibility criteria for the study in question  and efforts of the sponsor of and clinical sites involved in the trial to facilitate timely enrollment 

table of contents for example  patient enrollment for our phase ii proof of concept trial of jnj q in hospitalized pneumonia patients was slower than expected 
we might have difficulties obtaining sufficient patient enrollment or clinician support to conduct our other clinical trials as planned  and we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or delay or modify our plans significantly 
these considerations might result in our being unable to successfully achieve our projected development timelines  or potentially even lead us to consider the termination of ongoing clinical trials or development of a product for a particular indication 
changes in the us and international healthcare industry  including reimbursement rates  could adversely affect the commercial value of our development product candidates 
the us and international healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may significantly affect the purchasing practices and pricing of pharmaceuticals 
the laws and regulations governing and issued by applicable regulatory agencies may change and additional government regulations might be enacted  which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
the us congress adopted healthcare reform and might adopt other legislation that could have the effect of putting downward pressure on the prices that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for prescription drugs 
cost containment measures  whether instituted by healthcare providers or imposed by government health administration regulators or new regulations  could result in greater selectivity in the purchase of drugs 
as a result  third party payors might challenge the price and cost effectiveness of our products 
in addition  in many major markets outside the united states  pricing approval is required before sales may commence 
as a result  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of approved healthcare products 
we might not be able to obtain or maintain our desired price for the products we develop 
any product we introduce might not be considered cost effective relative to alternative therapies 
as a result  adequate third party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to obtain or maintain prices sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
also  the trend towards managed healthcare in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations  as well as legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government insurance programs  might all result in lower prices  reduced reimbursement levels and diminished markets for our products 
these factors will also affect the products that are marketed by our collaborators and licensees 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government regulation that might arise from legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we might not be permitted to market our future products and our business could suffer 
manufacturing changes might result in delays in obtaining regulatory approval or marketing for our products 
if we make changes in the manufacturing process for any of our products  we might be required to demonstrate to the applicable regulatory agencies that the changes have not caused the resulting drug material to differ significantly from the drug material previously produced 
further  any significant manufacturing changes for the production of our product candidates could result in delays in development or regulatory approval or in the reduction or interruption of commercial sales of our product candidates 
our contract manufacturers inability to maintain manufacturing operations in compliance with applicable regulations within our planned time and cost parameters could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have made manufacturing changes and could make additional manufacturing changes for the production of our products currently in clinical development 
these manufacturing changes or an inability to immediately show comparability between the older material and the newer material after making manufacturing changes could result in delays in development or regulatory approvals or in reduction or interruption of commercial sales and could impair our competitive position 

table of contents our business might be harmed if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials 
we depend on outside vendors for the supply of raw materials used to produce our product candidates for use in clinical trials 
once a supplier s materials have been selected for use in the manufacturing process  the supplier in effect becomes a sole or limited source of that raw material due to regulatory compliance procedures 
if the third party suppliers were to cease production or otherwise fail to supply us with quality raw materials and we were unable to contract on acceptable terms for these services with alternative suppliers  our ability to produce our products and to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates would be adversely affected 
this could impair our competitive position 
if the third party suppliers were to cease production or otherwise fail to supply us with quality raw materials and we were unable to contract on acceptable terms for these services with alternative suppliers  our ability to produce our products and to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates would be adversely affected 
this could impair our competitive position 
we must comply with extensive government regulations and laws 
we and our collaboration partners are subject to extensive regulation by federal government  state governments  and the foreign countries in which we conduct our business 
in particular  we are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation as a developer of drug candidates 
for example  the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  research  manufacture  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  quality control  adverse event reporting  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate  is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we must rely on our contract manufacturers and third party suppliers for regulatory compliance and adhering to the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  requirements 
if these manufacturers or suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations  including fda pre or post approval inspections and cgmp requirements  then the fda could sanction us 
these sanctions could include fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products  delay  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  product seizures or recalls  operational restrictions or criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results 
if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations  we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties  damages and fines 
similarly  if the hospitals  physicians or other providers or entities with which we do business are found non compliant with applicable laws  they might be subject to sanctions  which could also have a negative impact on us 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations  and additional legal or regulatory change 
any action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against it  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses  divert our management s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 
we expend a significant amount of resources on compliance efforts and such expenses are unpredictable and might adversely affect our operating results 
changing laws  regulations and standards might also create uncertainty and increase insurance costs 
we are committed to compliance and maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment might result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we might incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental regulations or to defend claims arising from accidents involving the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  discharge  handling and disposal of materials and wastes used in our operations 
as a result  we might be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages and incur liabilities  which exceed our resources 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of the adverse effect on our business or the financial and other costs that might result from any new government requirements arising out of future legislative  administrative or judicial actions 

table of contents we might be subject to product liability claims  and our insurance coverage and indemnification rights might not be adequate to cover these claims 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other types of claims in the event that the use of products during research and development efforts or after commercialization results in death  personal injury or other adverse effects 
pre clinical and clinical trials are conducted during the development of our drug candidates to determine the safety and efficacy of potential products for use by humans following approval by regulatory authorities 
despite our efforts to determine the safety of our drug candidates in pre clinical studies and use of clinical study protocols approved by regulators  unanticipated negative side effects might become evident only when the drug candidates have been delivered to humans during clinical trials or used by patients in the marketplace 
this risk exists even with respect to any products that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
while we will procure and maintain liability insurance with coverage up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate and generally have indemnification rights under our collaboration agreements  our insurance might not be sufficient to satisfy any or all liabilities that may arise and our indemnification rights might not apply or be sufficient to cover such claims 
also  adequate insurance coverage might not be available in the future at acceptable cost  if at all 
our operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event 
we depend on our collaboration partners  service providers and other facilities for the continued operation of our business 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  pandemic flu  hurricanes and ice storms  could disrupt our operations or those of our collaboration partners  which could also affect us 
even though we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events  we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us or our collaboration partners could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial performance 
we must protect electronic information and assets to succeed 
we rely on critical and sensitive data  such as personally identifiable patient information  trade secrets  intellectual property and corporate strategic plans 
security of this type of data is exposed to increasing external threats 
we are also subject to various standards for the protection of personally identifiable information 
failure to implement appropriate safeguards to adequately protect against any unauthorized or unintentional access  acquisition  use  modification  loss or disclosure of this critical or sensitive data may adversely affect our operations 
risks resulting from our spin off from ppd our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future financial position  future results of operations or future cash flows and does not reflect what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand alone company during the periods presented 
our historical financial information included in this form k does not necessarily reflect what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand alone publicly traded company during the periods presented prior to june in addition  it is not necessarily indicative of our future financial position  future results of operations or future cash flows 
this is primarily a result of the following factors prior to our separation  our business was operated by ppd as part of its broader corporate organization and we did not operate as a stand alone company  most general administrative functions were performed by ppd for the combined entity  so although our historical combined financial statements reflect allocations of costs for services shared with ppd  these allocations may differ from the costs we will incur for these services as an independent company  after the completion of our separation  the cost of capital for our business might be higher than ppd s cost of capital prior to our separation  and prior to the separation  our financial statements include revenues and expenses of services that we did not continue subsequent to the separation 

table of contents we have a limited history operating as an independent company upon which you can evaluate us 
we have a limited operating history as a stand alone entity 
while our compound partnering business has constituted a part of the historic operations of ppd since  we have only operated as a stand alone company without the cro business since june following the spin off  as an independent company  our ability to satisfy our obligations and achieve profitability will be solely dependent upon the future performance of our compound partnering business  and we will not be able to rely upon the capital resources and cash flows of the cro business remaining with ppd 
we might have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with ppd 
the agreements we entered into with ppd in connection with the spin off  including the master development services agreement  the sublease  the employee matters agreement and the transition services agreement  were negotiated while we were still part of ppd 
the terms of these agreements relate to  among other things  drug development services to be provided to us by ppd  the subleasing of our offices  employee benefit matters and the provision of transition services to us by ppd 
the master development services agreement requires us to use ppd for specified drug development services for three years contingent on ppd s expertise and capabilities to provide the needed services 
while we believe the terms and conditions of these agreements with ppd are reasonable and acceptable to us  they might not reflect the same terms and conditions that we could have obtained had we sought competitive bids from and negotiated with unaffiliated parties 

table of contents risks relating to our common stock various factors could negatively affect the market price or market of our common stock  which has traded publicly since june our stock has a limited trading history because we only became a separate public company in june  which could make investing in our stock riskier than more established companies 
in addition  market prices for securities of pharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile  and we expect such volatility to continue for the foreseeable future  so that investment in our securities involves substantial risk 
additionally  the stock market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following are some of the factors that might have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock developments or disputes as to patent or other proprietary rights  approval or introduction of competing products and technologies  results of clinical trials  failures or unexpected delays in timelines for our potential products in development  including the obtaining of regulatory approvals  delays in manufacturing or clinical trial plans  fluctuations in our operating results  market reaction to announcements by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies  initiation  termination or modification of agreements with our collaborators or disputes or disagreements with collaborators  loss of key personnel  litigation or the threat of litigation  public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us  sales of our common stock held by our directors and executive officers  and comments and expectations of results made by securities analysts or investors 
if any of these factors causes us to fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  or if adverse conditions prevail or are perceived to prevail with respect to our business  the price of our common stock would likely drop significantly 
a significant drop in the price of a company s common stock often leads to the filing of securities class action litigation against such a company 
this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
your percentage ownership in furiex might be diluted in the future 
your percentage ownership in furiex might be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors  officers and employees  as well as any future equity financing 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law might prevent or delay an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with our board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
these provisions include  among others no right of our shareholders to act by written consent  procedures requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals or nominations for directors for election at shareholder meetings  the right of our board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and no shareholder rights to call a special shareholders meeting 

table of contents delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal 
these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 
however  these provisions apply even if the offer might be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders

results of operations on june  we became an independent company upon the spin off by pharmaceutical product development  inc as part of and prior to the spin off  ppd transferred to us million in cash and current accounts receivable and payable associated with the compound partnering business 
our business consists solely of compound development and partnering activities 
accordingly  we operate in one reportable business segment 
historically  our revenues consisted primarily of milestone and royalty payments from collaborators from out licensed compounds 
for the year ended december   our year to date revenue includes million in regulatory approval milestones resulting from regulatory and pricing approval of nesina in japan in addition to million in royalty revenue from the sale of priligy and nesina by our collaborators  alza and takeda 
for the year ended december   our year to date revenue of million is comprised of royalty revenue from the sale of priligy and nesina liovel by our collaborators  alza and takeda 
we incurred research and development expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our research and development expenses include costs incurred for our clinical stage drug candidates  including the statin  ppd  and the two compounds in licensed from janssen 
we expect our level of research and development expenditures related to phase ii studies to decline significantly over the next quarter as work on our various phase ii studies comes to completion 
we currently expect expenses associated with the continued development of mudelta to be between and million over the next year related to phase iii costs 
these expenses include contract research organization services provided by ppd  non clinical testing and clinical trial material manufacturing provided by third parties  and the direct cost of our personnel managing the programs and payments to third parties 
all research and development expenses for our drug candidates and external collaborations are expensed as incurred 

table of contents the timing and amount of any future expenses  completion dates and revenues related to our drug candidates are subject to significant uncertainty due to the nature of our development programs 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates 
the timing and amount of our research and development expenses will depend upon the costs associated with the present and potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  any related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our pre clinical programs and manufacturing costs 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of events arising during clinical development 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
the timing and amount of revenues  if any  are equally dependent upon the success of the clinical trials as well as the commercial success of these products in the marketplace  all of which are subject to a variety of risk factors and uncertainties 
for the year ended december   we reported an operating loss of million and net loss of million 
we expect to continue to incur net losses until revenues from all sources reach a level sufficient to support our ongoing operations 
our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors described in part item a for information on these risks and uncertainties 
basis of accounting the accompanying combined financial statements for periods prior to june   have been derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of ppd  and from the historical cost basis of the assets and liabilities of the various activities that reflect the combined results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of the discovery sciences segment of ppd 
all the business components of the discovery sciences segment have been included in the historical statements because they were managed by common ppd segment management  and because they reflected historical performance of segment management 
in may  ppd discontinued operations of its wholly owned subsidiary ppd dermatology  inc  formerly magen biosciences  inc  due to unfavorable efficacy data associated with the mag program 
this business unit is recorded as discontinued operations in the statements of operations 
additionally  the discovery sciences segment included pre clinical consulting services not offered by us 
all rights and obligations related to pre clinical consulting services and the definitive purchase agreements related to ppd dermatology  inc have been retained by ppd 
for periods prior to the june  spin off  we were allocated expenses from ppd such as executive oversight  risk management  accounting  tax  legal  investor relations  human resources  information technology  facilities and depreciation  but were not allocated the underlying productive assets  such as information systems equipment  and furniture and facilities that were not assigned to us  but from which we have benefited 
such expenses have been reflected in the combined and consolidated financial statements as expense allocations from ppd 
the basis of these allocations included full time equivalent employees for the respective periods presented and square footage of occupied space 
see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the allocations 
management believes that the assumptions and allocations underlying the combined and consolidated financial statements are reasonable 
for periods prior to the june  spin off  the financial information in these combined and consolidated financial statements does not include all expenses that would have been incurred had we been a separate  stand alone publicly traded entity 
for periods prior to the june  spin off  the combined and consolidated financial statements include assets  liabilities and operations for ppd dermatology  inc and pre clinical consulting services that are not included in our operations after the spin off 
as a result  the financial information herein does not reflect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows had we been a separate  stand alone entity during the historical periods presented

expenses research and development  or r d  expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from the decrease in r d expense was due predominantly to reduced development costs for the mudelta and jnj q compounds offset by increased spending related to the ppd compound

table of contents as of december   we have substantially completed the phase ii clinical trials for the mudelta and jnj q compounds 
on april   janssen announced that in connection with a broad strategic review of its portfolio of infectious disease programs  it will be redirecting its research and development efforts toward antivirals and vaccines  and will not be investing in the development of new antibacterial therapies 
as a result  janssen elected not to exercise its option to continue the development of the jnj q compound 
on april   we announced that we had acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize the jnj q compound under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
on november   we announced we had acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize the mudelta compound under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
we acquired these rights as a result of janssen s decision not to exercise its option under the agreement to continue development of mudelta 
we plan to continue evaluating other partnering and funding opportunities for both the jnj q and mudelta compounds 
in december  we announced top line results from the phase ii trial of ppd based on these results  we have discontinued further spending on the ppd program and plan to terminate the license agreement with ranbaxy in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
we will owe ranbaxy a million development milestone payment upon completion of the phase ii final study report  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of r d expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period for a variety of reasons  including the number of compounds under development  the stages of development and changes in development plans 
we currently expect expenses associated with the continued development of mudelta to be between and million over the next year related to phase iii costs 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a expenses  increased million to million for the year ended december  from income taxes during and  we did not record a tax benefit related to our operating losses because we have provided full valuation allowances against our assets based on our history of operating losses 
additionally  with the exception of the pre acquisition federal and state tax filings for magen biosciences  inc and certain separate state filings  through the june  spin off  our operations were included in the consolidated federal and combined state tax returns of ppd  and the resulting tax attributes have been fully utilized by ppd and are no longer available to us for future use 
subsequent to june   we have filed federal and state returns separately from ppd and can use our tax attributes accordingly 
however  we anticipate that we will require a full valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets until such time as we are able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of profitability 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded an insignificant amount of income tax expense 
this amount relates to the adjustment of a deferred tax liability associated with historical goodwill  which is amortized and deductible for tax purposes  but is an indefinite lived intangible asset for financial reporting purposes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the primary source of our cash is the million ppd provided us upon the spin off on june   million of cash received related to milestone and royalty revenues since the spin off and cash from the issuance of debt 
on august   we entered into a loan and security agreement with midcap funding iii  llc and silicon valley bank 
the loan agreement is structured in two tranches 
the first tranche in the amount of million was drawn upon closing of the transaction 
the second tranche of million only becomes available to us if a pre defined financing event occurs prior to march  we expect that these sources of cash should fund our operations and working capital requirements for the next months  based on current operating plans 
in addition to the ppd cash contribution and borrowings under the loan agreement  we expect to receive future milestone and royalty payments from our existing collaborations that would provide additional support for our operations and working capital requirements 
the timing and amount of any future expenses  trial completion dates and revenues related to our compounds are subject to significant uncertainty 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates 
the timing and amount of our research and development expenses will depend upon the costs associated with the present and potential future clinical trials and non clinical studies of our drug candidates  any related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements and manufacturing costs 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of events arising during clinical development 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those we currently anticipate to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
the timing and amount of revenues  if any  are dependent upon the success of the clinical trials as well as the commercial success of these products in the marketplace  all of which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others the cost and expense of continuing the research and development activities of our existing candidates  new collaborative agreements that we might enter into in the future  progress of product candidates in clinical trials as it relates to the cost of development and the receipt of future milestone payments  if any  the ability of our licensees and collaborators to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market licensed products  the continued or additional support by our collaborators or other third parties of r d efforts and clinical trials  time required to gain regulatory approvals  the demand for our potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by us  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect our proprietary technologies 
in order to develop and obtain regulatory approval for our potential product candidates we might need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or from other sources  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
additional financing might not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing might only be available on terms dilutive or otherwise detrimental to our stockholders or our business 
for the year ended december   our operating activities used million in cash as compared to million used for the same period in the increase in net cash used in operating activities of million was due primarily to changes in operating assets and liabilities  a decrease in revenue of million and a decrease in r d expenses of million from  and discontinued operations of million in for the year ended december   our investing activities used million in cash related to the purchase of short term investments 
for the year ended december   our investing activities provided million in cash 
the purchaser of piedmont research center  llc had an indemnification holdback of million  which ppd received  offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
for the year ended december   our financing activities provided million in cash under the loan agreement with midcap funding iii  llc and silicon valley bank and million from the issuance of common stock related to option exercises by employees and consultants 
for the year ended december   our financing activities provided million of cash related to the net change in investment from our former parent and million related to cash contributed by ppd as part of the spin off 
as of december   we had three collaborations that involve potential future expenditures 
the first is our collaboration with alza for priligy 
in connection with this collaboration  we have an obligation to pay a royalty to eli lilly and company of on annual net sales of the compound in excess of million 
as of december   we are not obligated to pay any ongoing costs of development for this compound 
we are actively evaluating and pursuing the possibility of restructuring the existing agreement with alza  for priligy  with the possibility of involving another collaborative partner 
any transaction might require that the company negotiate additional out licenses or collaborations  and could require additional external sources of financing 

table of contents the second collaboration involving future expenditures is in respect of the two compounds in licensed from janssen jnj q and mudelta 
on april   janssen announced that in connection with a broad strategic review of its portfolio of infectious disease programs  it will be redirecting its research and development efforts toward antivirals and vaccines  and will not be investing in the development of new antibacterial therapies 
as a result  janssen elected not to exercise its option to continue the development of the jnj q compound 
on april   we announced we had acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize the jnj q compound under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
on november   we announced we had acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize the mudelta compound under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
we acquired these rights as a result of janssen s decision not to exercise its option under the agreement to continue development of jnj q and mudelta 
we plan to continue evaluating other partnering and funding opportunities for both the jnj q and mudelta compounds 
we may be obligated to pay janssen  for both the jnj q and mudelta compounds  individually  up to million in regulatory milestone payments and  if approved for marketing  up to million in sales based milestone payments and sales based royalties increasing from the mid to upper single digit percentages as sales volume increases 
royalties would be paid for a period of ten years after the first commercial sale or  if later  the expiration of the last valid patent claim or the expiration of patent exclusivity 
we currently expect expenses associated with the continued development of mudelta to be between and million over the next year related to phase iii costs 
the third collaboration involving future expenditures is with ranbaxy for a statin compound  ppd in december  we announced top line results from the phase ii trial of ppd based on these results  we have discontinued further spending on the ppd program and plan to terminate our license agreement with ranbaxy in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
we will owe ranbaxy a million development milestone payment upon completion of the phase ii final study report  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of if required  we might seek funds from new collaborators or from issuances of equity or debt securities or from other sources 
while we believe we will have adequate sources of liquidity to fund our operations for at least months  our sources of liquidity over that time period could be affected by among other things risks and costs related to our development efforts  regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates  changes in regulatory compliance requirements  reliance on existing collaborators and the potential need to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  personal injury or other tort claims  international risks  environmental or intellectual property claims  or other factors described under item a 
risk factors 
contractual obligations on august   we entered into a loan and security agreement with midcap funding iii  llc and silicon valley bank  collectively  the lenders 
the loans are divided into two separate tranches 
the first tranche of million closed on august  the second tranche of million only becomes available to us if a pre defined financing event occurs prior to march  the first tranche bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and is due august  interest accrues monthly and is payable on the first day of the following month  in arrears 
principal payments of the first tranche begin on august   are due the first day of each month  and will be paid on a ratable monthly basis until maturity 
we intend to use the proceeds from the loans to support research and development for our clinical stage compounds jnj q and mudelta 
a final payment fee is due to the lenders in an amount equal to of the loan commitments  payable at the maturity date or earlier prepayment of the loans 
we may prepay the first tranche subject to a prepayment fee of between one and four percent of the amount borrowed  depending on the time of the prepayment 
the amount of interest expense related to the loan agreement included in the statements of operations for the year ended december  was million 
included in this amount is the ratable accrual over the term of the loan of the final payment fee  payable upon the maturity date  which is presented in other long term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets 
under the loan agreement  we are subject to affirmative covenants customary for financings of this type  including the obligations to maintain good standing  provide certain notices to the lenders  deliver financial statements to the lenders  maintain insurance  discharge all taxes  protect intellectual property and protect collateral 
we are also subject to negative covenants customary for financings of this type  including that we may not enter into a merger or consolidation or certain change of control events  incur liens on the collateral  incur additional indebtedness  dispose of any property  change our jurisdictions of organization or our organizational structures or types  declare or pay dividends other than dividends payable solely in common stock  make certain investments or acquisitions  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates  in each case subject to certain customary exceptions  including exceptions that allow us to acquire additional compounds and to 
table of contents enter into licenses and similar agreements providing for the use and collaboration of our intellectual property provided certain conditions are met 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment accounts serve as collateral for the loan 
we are currently in compliance with our obligations under the agreement 
the loan agreement provides that events of default include failure to make payment of principal or interest on the loan when required  failure to perform certain obligations under the loan agreement and related documents  defaults in certain other indebtedness and certain other events including certain adverse actions taken by the food and drug administration or other governmental authorities 
upon events of default  our obligations under the loan agreement may  or in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy will automatically  be accelerated 
upon the occurrence of any event of default  our obligations under the loan agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of a above the rate of interest applicable to such obligations immediately prior to the occurrence of the event of default and b the maximum rate allowable under law 
as of december   future minimum payments on all our contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  were as follows related to our loan agreement and operating leases in the following locations morrisville  north carolina  wilmington  north carolina  rockville  maryland  richmond  virginia  blue bell  pennsylvania  and austin  texas years ended december in thousands total long term debt principal long term debt interest operating leases total contractual obligations as of december   we were contingently obligated under collaboration agreements that have not been included in the table above due to the inherent uncertainty in the amounts and timing of payments 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our combined and consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our combined and consolidated financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition we generate revenue in the form of upfront payments  development and regulatory milestone payments  royalties and sales based milestone payments in connection with the out licensing of compounds 
the payment of future milestones and royalties will depend on the success of our compound development and our collaborators success in developing and commercializing compounds 
upfront payments are generally paid within a short period of time following the execution of an out license or collaboration agreement 
milestone payments are typically one time payments to us triggered by our collaborator s achievement of specified development and regulatory events such as the commencement of phase iii trials or regulatory submission approval 
royalties are payments received by us based on net product sales of a collaborator 
sales based milestone payments are typically one time payments to us triggered when aggregate net sales of product by a collaborator for a specified period for example  an annual period reach an agreed upon threshold amount 
we recognize upfront payments  development and regulatory milestone payments  royalty payments and sales based milestone payments from our collaborators when the event which triggers the obligation of payment has occurred  there is no further obligation on our part in connection with the payment and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually on october and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
in performing the annual impairment test  the fair value of the company was determined using the income approach 
we have a single reporting unit 
for purposes of the income approach  fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
we made assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  probability of future compound development and appropriate discount rates 
the compound development estimates are highly subjective due to the uncertainty associated with the amounts and timing of expected milestone and royalty payments 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our analysis are based on our most recent operational budgets  long range strategic plans and other estimates 
actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts  which could have a material impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements 
we use estimates of market participant weighted average cost of capital as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our future expected cash flows  adjusted for the risks and uncertainty inherent in our industry generally and in our internally developed forecasts 
based on our review as of october   our calculated fair value of equity was in excess of carrying value by a substantial margin 
the fair value of goodwill could be materially impacted by future adverse changes such as future declines in operating results  a decline in the valuation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company stocks  including the valuation of our own common stock  a slowdown in the worldwide economy or the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasted operating results or the delay or abandonment of any research and development programs 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method related to stock options and other share based compensation 
the expense is measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards that are expected to vest and is recorded over the applicable requisite service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  the fair value is based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price based on peer companies  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
a change in the assumptions used in the fair value based calculation could have a significant impact on the fair value of options 
see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements for details regarding the assumptions used in estimating fair value for the years ended december   and regarding equity awards granted to furiex employees by ppd and furiex 

table of contents tax valuation allowances we calculated our income tax provision for the periods prior to june  using the separate return basis as if we had filed separate income tax returns under our existing structure 
the provision for income taxes subsequent to the spin off has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the year  plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes result from differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax attributes are expected to be recovered or paid  and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment  including the long range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives 
adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made 
due to the historical losses from our operations  a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets has been recorded 
for the year ended december   we recorded an insignificant amount of income tax expense 
this amount relates to the adjustment of a deferred tax liability associated with historical goodwill  which is amortized and deductible for tax purposes  but is an indefinite lived intangible asset for financial reporting purposes 
the amount reflected in the statements of operations for year ended december  is the tax effect of the tax amortization of this item 
because the associated deferred tax liability relates to an indefinite lived intangible  we do not consider this item in computing the valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   the deferred tax liability associated with this intangible asset  reflected in other long term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets  was approximately million 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a new accounting standard related to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this standard applies to all deliverables in contractual arrangements in all industries in which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
this standard also addresses the unit of accounting for an arrangement involving multiple deliverables and how arrangement consideration should be allocated 
our adoption of this standard on january  did not have a material impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  the objective of which is to establish a revenue recognition model for contingent consideration that is payable upon the achievement of an uncertain future event  referred to as a milestone 
our adoption of this standard on january  did not have a material impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an update to the accounting standard that permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently required 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is  more likely than not  greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we did not early adopt this standard and are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our combined and consolidated financial statements 
income taxes except for the pre acquisition federal and state tax filings for magen biosciences  inc and certain separate state filings through the june  spin off  our operations have been included in the consolidated federal and combined state tax returns of ppd 
as such  except for the pre acquisition tax attributes of magen biosciences  inc  and some losses from certain separate filing states  the tax attributes of our operations prior to june  have been utilized or paid by ppd 
thus  the tax attributes which have been included in ppd s combined returns have not been accounted for in the results of our operations 
subsequent to june   we have filed federal and state returns separately from ppd and can use our tax attributes accordingly 
potential volatility of annual operating results our annual operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
factors that could cause these fluctuations to occur include 
table of contents the success of achieving milestones and the timing of our milestone payments or other revenue  if any  our dependence on a small number of compounds and collaborations  the success or failure of clinical trials and other aspects of developing and commercializing our product candidates  our ability to properly manage our growth  the timing and amount of costs associated with r d and compound partnering collaborations  our ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel  the timing and extent of new government regulations  and intellectual property risks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our current investment policies  we invest our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in money market funds which invest in short term us treasury securities with insignificant rates of return 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
under our loan and security agreement with midcap funding iii  llc and silicon valley bank  we borrowed million on august  this outstanding debt bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and is due august  due to the fixed rate associated with this outstanding debt  an increase in market rates would have no impact on our future obligations as of december  our purchases of raw materials and finished goods are denominated primarily in us dollars  purchases denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are insignificant 
additionally  our net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are insignificant and have not historically exposed us to material risk associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
given these facts  we have not considered it necessary to use foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage changes in currency rates 
we do not now  nor do we plan to  use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  these circumstances might change
