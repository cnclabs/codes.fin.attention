item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies to all manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers for all sizes of disk drives 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives  and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations are affected from time to time by disk drive industry demand changes  adjustments in inventory levels throughout the disk drive supply chain  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market position and our customers market position  changes in supply chain alignment by a customer  our customers production yields and our own product transitions  production yields and production capacity utilization 
though the overall market for suspension assemblies grew in and  our net sales decreased significantly in those years because of market share losses 
our shipments of suspension assemblies declined in and in in  improvements in our tsa product yield and output  together with a faster than expected ramp of our assembly operation in thailand  provided an opportunity to further lower our operating costs through a consolidation and restructuring plan 
with the transition from our legacy tsa component manufacturing process to our more automated tsa process  we needed fewer employees to meet customers volume requirements 
additionally  progress at our thailand assembly operation enabled us to accelerate the transition of assembly manufacturing to that location and consolidate our hutchinson  minnesota components operations into our operations in eau claire  wisconsin 
early in  severe flooding in thailand required us to suspend our assembly operations at our thailand manufacturing facility in the second week of october in addition to the negative impact on our operations  the flooding in thailand temporarily constrained the overall production capacity of the hard disk drive supply chain in the first half of the year 
in the second half of the year  overall disk drive production capacity recovered from the flooding  however  demand for disk drives weakened in the world market 
these factors were the primary causes of a decrease in our suspension assembly shipments in by the end of  we resumed production at our thailand manufacturing facility and began shipping products for customer qualification 
we had approximately half of our pre flood capacity installed by the end of and expect to fully return to pre flood capacity levels by the middle of by the end of our third quarter of  we expect to have about one half of our total assembly output coming from our thailand operation 
near the end of  we expect to have full capacity for the thailand site installed and shortly thereafter  we should begin realizing the full cost benefits for the operation 
as part of our continued focus on overall cost reduction  we identified approximately positions to be eliminated in the us subsequent to the end of we estimate that our first quarter results will include a charge of approximately  for severance costs related to this workforce reduction 
we are also further consolidating our manufacturing operations at our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
we expect these consolidations will result in approximately  of accelerated depreciation in and may result in asset impairment write offs in the range of  to  in we are making changes in our overall cost structure with a goal of having a business model that is cash neutral or better  as we get further into  at shipment volumes of million per week 
as volumes grow to more than million per week  we believe we ll be able to generate positive free cash flow 
as we progress through  we expect our financial results to benefit from higher shipment volume and improved fixed cost leverage  improvements in our tsa efficiency and output  increased adoption of dsa suspensions  the cost advantages we will realize as we increase output from our thailand assembly operation and our continued focus on cost reduction 
debt refinancing as a result of the debt refinancing that we completed during our third quarter  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  the principal amount of our outstanding debt with a first put date in was reduced from  to  the debt refinancing resulted in the retirement of  aggregate principal amount of our notes and  aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes and the issuance of  aggregate principal amount of secured notes and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
accordingly  our financial position was improved by lengthening the average maturities of our debt and our overall debt balance was reduced from  to  while maintaining our cash levels 
thailand flooding early in  severe flooding in thailand required us to suspend our assembly operations at our thailand manufacturing facility in the second week of october we have leveraged our us assembly operations to offset the temporary loss of capacity in thailand 
this resulted in our retaining approximately employees in our hutchinson  minnesota manufacturing facility that we previously expected to terminate and whose anticipated severance and benefits were included in our severance and benefits charges 
this resulted in a reduction of  in our severance and benefits expense during our first quarter of during our fourth quarter of  which ended before the flooding  approximately one third of our sales originated out of our thailand assembly facility and our thailand operations had an assembly capacity of four to five million parts per week 
after review of the flood mitigation plans of the thai government and those of the industrial park where our plant is located  we are proceeding with plans to restore our thailand manufacturing facility to pre flood output levels 
the industrial park has completed construction of a flood wall and we have restored our manufacturing facility and qualified its clean room 
we resumed production at that facility and began shipping products for customer qualification during the third quarter of we had approximately half of our pre flood capacity installed by the end of and expect to fully return to pre flood capacity levels by the middle of near the end of  we expect to have full capacity for the thailand site installed and shortly thereafter  we should begin realizing the full cost benefits for our thailand operation 
in  as a result of the flooding in thailand we recorded flood related costs of  and  in total  we spent approximately  for incremental costs  capital expenditures for site restoration and equipment replacement  recovery expenses  and inventory replenishment 
these costs were partially offset by  in insurance proceeds 
we estimate we will spend an additional  in to restore our thailand manufacturing operation to pre flood capacity levels and to cover the incremental costs of manufacturing in the united states 
these amounts do not include lost profits from the lower demand due to constraints in the overall capacity in the disk drive supply chain as a result of the flooding 
our flood insurance policy in effect at the time of the october thailand flood had a one year term and has expired 
we have evaluated flood related insurance available to us  assessing our current flood risk compared to the cost of flood insurance 
our current flood coverage under a thailand government program is approximately  in addition to our current insurance flood coverage of approximately  for our thailand facility 
our available assembly capacity and vertically integrated components operations in the us are enabling us to meet current levels of customer demand and should provide us with the flexibility to respond to increases in demand as we continue to restore our thailand manufacturing operation by the end of general business the following table sets forth our quarterly suspension assembly shipment quantities for our disk drive components division in millions for the periods indicated by quarter by quarter first second third fourth first second third fourth suspension assembly shipment quantities the flooding in thailand temporarily constrained the overall production capacity of the hard disk drive supply chain in additionally  some hard disk drive manufacturers temporarily reduced the average capacity size of their disk drives to maximize their use of the components that have been in short supply  and therefore  maximize the number of disk drives that they were able to ship 
this may have temporarily reduced the number of suspensions per disk drive 
these factors caused a material decrease in our suspension assembly demand 
in our first quarter of  shipments decreased million or compared to the fourth quarter of due to the flood related capacity constraints at our customers 
our second quarter of shipments increased sequentially in all segments  with the largest percentage increase in shipments for enterprise applications 
we estimate that we maintained our overall suspension assembly market share in both the first and second quarters of  compared to the preceding quarter  by leveraging our vertically integrated us operations to meet customers needs 
our third quarter of shipments increased slightly compared with the preceding quarter but demand for our suspension assemblies declined by more than in the final five weeks of the quarter compared with the quarter s first eight weeks  primarily due to weakened disk drive demand 
our week fiscal fourth quarter of shipments totaled million  down on a weekly shipment basis compared with the week fiscal third quarter of decreased shipments of suspensions for enterprise applications were partially offset by an increase in shipments of suspensions for mobile applications 
industry sources estimate that disk drive shipments in the quarter ended september declined by compared with the preceding quarter 
increased allocations on our existing programs and participation on new program ramps helped offset the near term market weakness 
we expect our first quarter of suspension assembly shipments will be about to million  an increase of to on a weekly basis compared with the week fiscal fourth quarter 
hard disk drive shipments in the first quarter of are expected to be about flat with the preceding quarter 
we shipped million tsa suspension assemblies during  up from million in and million in tsa suspensions accounted for of our fourth quarter of shipments 
subtractive tsa suspensions continue to be phased out in favor of our more capable and lower cost additive tsa suspensions 
we are also purchasing additive flexures to fill other customer requirements 
as the shift in our product mix from subtractive tsa suspensions to additive tsa suspensions continues  and we make further improvements in our tsa process efficiency and capacity utilization  we expect to realize additional cost reductions 
our average selling price was in both and  and in suspension assembly pricing fluctuates from quarter to quarter and is likely to remain competitive  though normal pricing pressures have recently been offset primarily due to the mix of product sold 
our gross profits have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors  key among them being changes in demand for our suspension assemblies 
our customers often prefer a multiple source supply strategy and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand 
certain agreements with our customers also provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels for them 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross profits and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
in  gross profit was  or of net sales  compared to a gross profit of  or of net sales  for the lower shipment volume during and resulting impact on our ability to leverage our fixed costs prevented us from meeting our expectations for gross profit 
we estimate cost of goods sold in also included approximately  in incremental costs  while we have relied on our us assembly operations for the majority of our production 
we estimate that these costs will decrease as our production in thailand ramps 
near the end of  we expect to have full capacity for the thailand site installed and shortly thereafter  we should begin realizing the full cost benefits for the operation 
we expect gross profit to improve in as our shipment volume increases and as we ramp our thailand assembly operations 
improvement in our gross profits and operating profits will depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs 
our profits are sensitive to our level of fixed costs  as well as changes in volume  capacity utilization and product mix 
in the future  we may need to adjust our overall employment level due to fluctuating demand 
our overall employment level was  at the end of   at the end of and  at the end of our shipments of dual stage actuated  or dsa  suspension assemblies is increasing 
we continue to work with multiple customers on dsa programs 
dsa suspensions accounted for of our fourth quarter of suspension assembly shipments  up from in the third quarter of we expect dsa suspension assemblies will become an increasing portion of our shipments by the end of dsa suspensions carry a higher selling price but are more costly to manufacture 
the impact of the flood related disruption to our business is delaying the full realization of the benefits that our restructuring and consolidation plan were expected to bring 
nevertheless  we remain on a path that we expect will enable us to become the industry s lowest cost producer of suspension assemblies  which we believe is integral to winning preferred supplier positions on customers new disk drive programs and further improving our financial performance 
our biomeasurement division is engaged in the development  production and commercialization of products for the medical device market 
lower than expected sales of the inspectra sto systems and spending constraints in healthcare markets world wide led us to make operating changes within the biomeasurement division 
we have substantially reduced costs to narrow the division s operating losses 
the division s losses from operations were  for   for  and  for the biomeasurement division s loss for included  of asset impairments in this division 
subsequent to the end of  we made additional reductions in the biomeasurement division s headcount in order to further reduce costs 
disk drive market trends our suspension assemblies are components in hard disk drives used in computers and a variety of consumer electronics and enterprise storage products 
we believe that the continued growth of digital content world wide requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store  aggregate  host  distribute  manage and backup content  which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drives 
non compute applications  such as digital video recorders dvrs  gaming devices  digital cameras and internet based storage of consumer data are driving the broad  global growth of digital content through creation and sharing of all types of digital content  such as high resolution photos  high definition video and movies  and music by consumers and data by enterprises  collection and distribution of digital content through services and other company offerings such as youtube by google  inc  network infrastructure  including broadband  cable and satellite  which is enabling the access  hosting and distribution of digital content  consumption of digital content through dvrs  handheld devices and gaming consoles  and protection of content through storage backup devices and services 
the demand for disk drives and  therefore  suspension assemblies can be volatile as experienced since calendar due to market and world economic conditions 
in a weak economy  consumer and business spending tends to decline and demand for computer systems and other consumer electronics and enterprise storage products tends to decrease 
demand for suspension assemblies  therefore  may be adversely impacted as a result of a weaker economy 
in the long term  however  we expect that the growth in digital content and the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  desktop and mobile computers  increasingly complex software as well as the data intensive non compute market will increase demand for disk drives and  therefore  suspension assemblies 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models and the end devices in which disk drives are used 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the primary storage device of choice for applications requiring shorter access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per unit of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with flexures that have finer electrical conductors  greater lead counts and increased complexity such as interleaved or stacked traces or dsa suspension designs  and to the adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as formed and polished headlifts  larger dampers with through hole features and a variety of limiter configurations 
the development of next generation read write technology and the introduction of new types or configurations of read write heads configurations and sizes  and the continuing improvement in data density and the use of disk drives in consumer electronics and enterprise storage applications will require even finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
next generation disk drives also may require additional electrical conductors 
these changes may temporarily increase our development spending and reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
we are investing in developing the process capabilities and related capital equipment required to meet new industry specifications in and beyond 
the advent of new disk drive technologies may initially decrease our customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
in addition  disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is highly competitive 
while we are generally able to increase our selling price for suspension assemblies when they are introduced  our selling prices decrease as our products mature 
operations to operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for each period presented

net sales for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  suspension assembly sales decreased  primarily as a result of a decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments 
our average selling price remained at in both and the decrease in unit shipments was primarily a result of the flood related capacity constraints at our customers thailand facilities 
suspension assembly component sales were  in  primarily as a result of the flood related capacity constraints in the disk drive industry creating demand for our suspension assembly components 
we had no suspension assembly component sales in net sales in our biomeasurement division were  in  compared to  in gross profit for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  gross profit was of net sales in  compared to in the lower gross profit in was primarily the result of reduced sales  which reduced our ability to cover our fixed costs  as discussed above  partially offset by decreased spending as a result of our consolidation and restructuring plan 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for  an increase of  the increase was primarily related to higher labor expenses as a result of increased spending on tsa process and capacity improvements and new process technology 
research and development expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in research and development expenses were of net sales in and in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the lower selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to cost savings from our restructuring actions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as were of net sales in and in selling  general and administrative expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in during the first quarter of  severance and other expenses were reduced  we reversed  of previously accrued severance and benefits expenses  partially offset by  of other expenses incurred related to our site consolidation plans 
as a result of leveraging our us assembly operations to offset the temporary loss of manufacturing capacity in thailand  we retained approximately employees in our hutchinson  minnesota manufacturing facility that we previously expected to terminate and whose anticipated severance and benefits were included in our severance and benefits expenses 
during the second quarter of  we announced a manufacturing consolidation and restructuring plan that included eliminating approximately positions from our us workforce 
the workforce reduction and manufacturing consolidation resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of  of which  was related to our biomeasurement division 
debt refinancing costs for were  because the terms of the secured notes issued march  in exchange for notes were not substantially different  debt modification accounting was applied in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance 
the debt refinancing costs associated with the debt transactions were expensed as incurred 
as a result of the flooding in thailand  during  we recorded  of insurance recoveries  net of flood related costs  which included  of flood insurance recoveries  partially offset by  of asset impairments  inventory write downs  and thailand operating and site restoration costs  as discussed above 
loss from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division compared to a  loss for the biomeasurement division operating loss in was reduced by restructuring actions  partially offset by  of severance costs 
the gain on short and long term investments for was  compared to a gain of  for the gain in and was due to payments we received under a settlement agreement 
auction rate securities ars previously held by us were subsequently sold by the settlement parties at a price that was higher than the price identified in the settlement agreement 
in march  we issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes 
we issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes pursuant to an effective registration statement relating to an offer to purchase for cash or exchange for new securities any and all of our outstanding notes the tender exchange offer 
we issued the remaining  aggregate principal amount of secured notes in a private placement that included the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price for the secured notes and warrants issued in the private placement was  in accordance with the terms of the tender exchange offer  we made cash payments totaling  plus accrued and unpaid interest  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of notes 
applying debt extinguishment accounting to the purchases  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  we also issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes  and made cash payments in lieu of partial notes and for accrued and unpaid interest  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of notes 
because the terms of the secured notes and outstanding notes were not substantially different  debt modification accounting was applied in accordance with fasb guidance 
as a result  no gain or loss was recorded on the debt exchange 
in april  we purchased for cash  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes  which was partially funded by  of residual proceeds from the private placement of secured notes 
applying debt extinguishment accounting  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  in february  we retired an aggregate principal amount of  of the notes 
we made cash payments of  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of the notes and we issued  aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in july  we completed another exchange  in which we issued  aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes and made aggregate cash payments of  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
a total of  aggregate principal amount of the notes remained outstanding after completion of the july exchange 
we determined that the purchases and exchanges were a substantial debt modification and applied debt extinguishment accounting 
the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the liability component of our debt at the date of extinguishment was recorded as an  gain on extinguishment of debt 
the difference between the fair value of the liability component and the fair value of the consideration exchanged was applied as reacquisition of the equity component  which resulted in a  reduction to additional paid in capital 
operations to operations net sales for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  suspension assembly sales decreased  primarily as a result of an decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments and our average selling price decreased year over year from an average of in to an average of in due to a competitive pricing environment and the mix of product shipped 
the decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments in was primarily due to market share losses 
net sales in our biomeasurement division were  in  compared to  in gross profit for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  gross profit was of net sales in  compared to in the lower gross profit in was primarily the result of reduced sales  which reduced our ability to cover our fixed costs  no longer classifying our thailand assembly manufacturing start up expenses as selling  general and administrative expenses and  of accelerated depreciation as a result of the consolidation and restructuring plan 
these were partially offset by the cost savings from our consolidation and restructuring plan discussed above 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily related to lower labor expenses as a result of cost reduction actions 
research and development expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in research and development expenses were of net sales in and in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the lower selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to classifying our thailand assembly manufacturing expenses as cost of sales beginning with the quarter ended march  and lower biomeasurement division expenses primarily due to restructuring actions 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in and in selling  general and administrative expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in during the second quarter of  we announced a manufacturing consolidation and restructuring plan that included eliminating approximately positions from our us workforce 
the workforce reduction and manufacturing consolidation resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of  of which  was related to our biomeasurement division 
at the end of   remained to be paid 
subsequent to year end  due to the flooding in thailand  we leveraged our us assembly operations to offset the temporary loss of capacity in thailand 
this resulted in our retaining approximately employees in our hutchinson  minnesota manufacturing facility that we previously expected to terminate and that were included in our expected severance charges 
this resulted in reduction of our severance and benefit expense of  during our quarter ending december  the workforce reductions are expected to be completed by the end of our second quarter during the fourth quarter of  we announced actions to reduce costs  including eliminating approximately positions company wide 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of loss from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division compared to a  loss for the biomeasurement division s loss for included  of asset impairments in this division 
the biomeasurement division operating loss in was reduced by restructuring actions 
interest income for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a lower investment balance 
the gain on short and long term investments for was  compared to a loss of  for the gain in was due to payments we received under a settlement agreement 
auction rate securities ars previously held by us were subsequently sold by the settlement parties at a price that was higher than the price identified in the settlement agreement 
the loss for was due to the settlement agreement providing for the sale of a portion of our ars portfolio 
in february  we retired an aggregate principal amount of  of the notes 
we made cash payments of  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of the notes and we issued  aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in july  we completed another exchange  in which we issued  aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes and made aggregate cash payments of  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
a total of  aggregate principal amount of the notes remained outstanding after completion of the july exchange 
we determined that the purchases and exchanges were a substantial debt modification and applied debt extinguishment accounting 
the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the liability component of our debt at the date of extinguishment was recorded as an  gain on extinguishment of debt 
the difference between the fair value of the liability component and the fair value of the consideration exchanged was applied as reacquisition of the equity component  which resulted in a  reduction to additional paid in capital 
the income tax provision for was  compared to a benefit of  for the income tax benefit for was primarily due to a change in us tax law that enabled us to carry back some of our operating losses to prior years and apply for a refund of taxes paid in those years 
this benefit was partially offset by foreign income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations  our revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank  and additional financing capacity  if available given current credit market conditions and our operating performance 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at september   to  at september  our short term investments restricted decreased from  to  during the same period 
in total  our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments restricted decreased by  this decrease was primarily due to  used for repayment of debt   for capital expenditures   in net repayments of borrowings from our credit facility  and  of debt refinancing costs 
these decreases were offset by  in proceeds from the private placement of debt and  of cash provided by operations  which included  of flood insurance proceeds 
the reduction of the amounts in trade receivables from september  to september  of  was due to lower sales and an improvement in customer payment terms which reduced our days sales outstanding 
in recent years  our net sales have decreased significantly 
with ongoing uncertain market and economic conditions  we are continuing to carefully manage our cost structure and cash position to ensure that we will meet our debt obligations while preserving the ability to make investments that will enable us to respond to customer requirements and achieve profitability 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations  our credit facility and additional financing  if needed and as available given contractual restrictions  current credit market conditions and our operating performance  will be sufficient to meet our forecasted operating expenses  other debt service requirements  debt and capital expenditures through we currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our notes   aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes and  aggregate principal amount of our secured notes 
holders of our notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  and holders of our convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash as early as january during our third quarter  we refinanced a portion of our debt  as discussed below  by reducing the principal amount of our outstanding debt with a first put date in from  to  the refinancing improved our financial position by extending the average maturities on our debt and reducing our overall debt balance from  to  while maintaining our cash levels 
we may from time to time seek to prepay or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these transactions  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results  contractual restrictions and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional financing on terms acceptable to us  including covenants that we will be able to comply with in the short term  or at all  if needed 
if we are unable to obtain new financing  if and when necessary  our future financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
at a special meeting held june  our shareholders approved the issuance of up to  aggregate principal amount of additional convertible notes and the issuance of our common stock upon conversion thereof for cash in one or more future private placements or registered offerings 
accordingly  we may  but are not obligated to  issue a limited amount of additional convertible notes without further shareholder approval 
we are making changes in our overall cost structure with a goal of having a business model that is cash neutral or better  as we get further into  at shipment volumes of million per week 
as volumes grow to more than million suspension assemblies per week  we believe we ll be able to generate positive free cash flow 
pnc bank credit facility in september  we entered into a revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank 
the credit agreement provides us with a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to  subject to a borrowing base 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the personal and real property of hutchinson technology incorporated 
the maturity date of the credit facility is october  if  by october   the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes is reduced to  or less and we have at least  of liquidity remaining  otherwise the maturity date is october  because the completion of the tender exchange offer reduced the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes to  and we had more than  of liquidity remaining  the maturity date of the credit facility was extended to october  the credit agreement contains customary representations  warranties  covenants and events of default that  among other things  limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investment  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  create or incur liens  enter into operating leases  merge consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets  make capital expenditures  change the nature of our business  and expend the assets or free cash flow of certain subsidiaries 
the agreement also contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  ebitda and minimum liquidity 
we maintain an account at pnc bank with a minimum balance of  as required under the credit agreement 
during  the maximum amount outstanding on our credit facility was  which was fully repaid in october we did not draw upon the credit facility during the suspension of production at our thailand facility during october triggered an event of default provision related to business interruptions under our credit agreement with pnc bank  and we obtained a waiver of the event of default in december in february  we entered into a consent and amendment to our credit agreement with pnc bank  which itself was further amended in march under the amended consent and amendment  pnc bank consented to our use of the proceeds from the private placement of secured notes to purchase a portion of our outstanding convertible notes 
in july  we entered into an additional amendment to our credit agreement with pnc bank as agent and a lender 
the amendment modified certain of the financial covenants under the existing agreement  i to eliminate the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement for our fiscal quarters ended june  and september  and provide for aggregating the applicable measurement periods starting with our quarter ending december  and ii to implement an additional ebitda requirement for with this amendment in place  we were in compliance with the terms  provisions and financial covenants of the credit agreement as of september  if we are unable to generate sufficient operating results in future quarters  we may be out of compliance with financial covenants in the credit agreement in future quarters 
if necessary  we intend to negotiate a waiver of any noncompliance or an amendment of the financial covenant specific to the applicable period 
debt restructuring in march  we issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes 
we issued  aggregate principal amount pursuant to an effective registration statement relating to the tender exchange offer 
we issued the remaining  aggregate principal amount of secured notes in a private placement that included the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price for the secured notes and warrants issued in the private placement was  in accordance with the terms of the tender exchange offer  we made cash payments totaling  plus accrued and unpaid interest  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of notes 
applying debt extinguishment accounting to the purchases  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  we also issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes  and made cash payments in lieu of partial notes and for accrued and unpaid interest  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of notes 
because the terms of the secured notes and outstanding notes were not substantially different  debt modification accounting was applied in accordance with fasb guidance 
as a result  no gain or loss was recorded on the debt exchange 
a total of  aggregate principal amount of notes  included in current maturities of long term debt  remained outstanding after completion of the tender exchange offer 
in april  we purchased for cash  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes  which was partially funded by  of residual proceeds from the private placement of secured notes 
applying debt extinguishment accounting  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  secured notes the secured notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semiannually in arrears on january and july of each year  beginning july  and are set to mature on january  unless redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms 
they are secured by liens on all assets securing our existing or future senior secured credit facilities other than certain excluded assets  which liens rank junior in priority to any liens securing our senior secured credit facilities and other permitted priority liens 
we may redeem all or part of the secured notes at any time by paying of the principal amount redeemed  plus a make whole premium as of  and accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount redeemed to  the date of redemption subject to the rights of holders of the secured notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date as and to the extent provided in the indenture 
holders of the warrants issued in connection with the secured notes are entitled to participate pro rata in any dividends or other distributions whether in cash  securities or other assets paid  or rights offered  to holders of our common stock on an as exercised basis 
the warrants are also eligible for adjustment as necessary to protect from the dilutive effects of recapitalizations  reclassifications  stock splits and similar transactions 
as of september   warrants to purchase  shares had been exercised  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock during capital expenditures our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
the disk drive industry experiences rapid technology changes that require us to make substantial ongoing capital expenditures in product and process improvements to maintain our competitiveness 
significant industry technology transitions often result in increasing our capital expenditures 
the disk drive industry also experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction  which also results in fluctuations in our capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  for   for and  for capital expenditures for were primarily for new program tooling  new process technology and capability improvements  and thailand recovery 
capital expenditures for were primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  new program tooling and thailand assembly related equipment 
capital expenditures for were primarily for additional tsa flexure production capacity  establishing our thailand assembly operation and new program tooling 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures to be  to  in  primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  such as dsa suspension assemblies and product tooling 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  our revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank or additional financing  if available given current credit market conditions 
our capital expenditures for the disk drive components division are planned based on process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes  which may require new or improved process technologies  such as additive processing to produce flexures for our tsa suspensions or dsa suspensions  anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products and market demand for disk drives 
capital spending is also based on our ability to finance capital expenditures  as discussed above 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that we expect will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting our capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
share repurchase program in  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to spend up to  to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the share repurchase program is  we have not repurchased any shares since contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations at september  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total debt interest expense operating leases total as of september   the liability balance for uncertain tax positions was  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
we currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our notes 
holders of our notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  we also currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes 
holders of our convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash as early as january  the outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our secured notes matures on january  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the product has been delivered to the customer s premises 
we also store disk drive components division inventory in vmi facilities  which are warehouses located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from such facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that provide us with reimbursement for engineering services and specific program capacity to partially offset the costs of our investment 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program to which the services and capacity relate 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances arise due to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
at september   and september   we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
the fasb guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under the guidance  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our debt obligations that are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt 
at september   we had fixed rate debt of  with a fair market value of  we used trading activity to determine the fair market value of the notes and convertible notes 
the secured notes had not experienced significant trading activity  therefore the estimate was based on the closing market price of similar debt as of the end of the fiscal year 
as of september  we had no borrowings under our credit facility with pnc bank 
prior to march   amounts borrowed under the credit facility were subject to cash interest  at our election  at a rate equal to either i pnc bank s alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus per annum  or ii libor plus per annum 
after march   such loans  if any  are eligible to bear cash interest at a reduced rate equal to either i pnc bank s alternate base rate plus per annum or ii libor plus per annum if no defaults or events of default exist under the credit agreement 
our investing activities are guided by an investment policy  which is reviewed at least annually by our board of directors  and whose objectives are preservation and safety of capital  maintenance of necessary liquidity and maximizing of the rate of return within the stated guidelines 
our policy provides guidelines as to the maturity  concentration limits and credit quality of our investments  as well as guidelines for communication  authorized securities and other policies and procedures in connection with our investing activities 
we are exposed to various market risks and potential loss arising from changes in interest rates in connection with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held in investment accounts
