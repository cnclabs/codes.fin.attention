printed office products are shipped from our manufacturing and distribution facility in central illinois

we estimate that of patterson dental s consumable goods orders are shipped to the customer on time  which is generally within hours

purchasing of consumables and standard equipment is centralized  and our purchasing department uses a real time perpetual inventory system to manage inventory levels

table of contents while patterson dental makes purchases from many suppliers  and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell  the concentration of business with key suppliers is considerable 
our top ten supply vendors accounted for approximately and of the cost of dental products sold in both fiscal and of these ten  the top two vendors accounted for and of both fiscal and fiscal cost of sales  respectively 
competition the highly competitive us dental products distribution industry consists principally of national  regional and local full service and mail order distributors 
the dental supply market is extremely fragmented 
in addition to patterson dental and one other national  full service firm  sullivan schein dental  a unit of henry schein  inc  there are at least full service distributors that operate on a regional level  and hundreds of small local distributors 
also  some manufacturers sell directly to end users 
we approach our markets by emphasizing and delivering a value added model to the practitioner 
to differentiate ourselves from our competition  we deploy a strategy of premium customer service  a highly qualified and motivated sales force  experienced service technicians  an extensive breadth and mix of products and services  accurate and timely delivery of product  strategic location of sales offices and distribution centers  and competitive pricing 
patterson dental also experiences competition in canada in the dental supply market

veterinary supply overview webster veterinary  or webster  is a leading distributor of veterinary supplies primarily to companion pet dogs  cats and other common household pets and equine veterinary clinics across the united states 
webster provides products and services used for the diagnosis  treatment and or prevention of diseases in companion animals and equine

webster s agency commissions accounted for less than of our net sales in fiscal we estimate the market for pharmaceuticals and supplies sold to companion animal and equine veterinarians through distribution is approximately billion on an annual basis 
based upon the estimated billion market  we believe our share of this market is approximately 
similar to the dental supply market  the veterinary supply market is fragmented and geographically diverse 
as of december   according to the american veterinary medical association  or avma  there were more than  veterinarians in private practice nationwide specializing in small animals  predominately companion pets 
the average private veterinary practice generates approximately  of annual revenue 
these practices purchase between  and 
table of contents  of supplies each year  and similar to the dental practitioner  tend not to maintain a large supply of inventory on hand 
the typical veterinary practice purchases approximately of its supplies from its top two suppliers 
the average purchase of consumables by the veterinary practice is noticeably higher than that of the dental practitioner due predominately to pharmaceutical products  which are administered and dispensed by veterinarians 
historically  the demand for veterinary services has grown significantly faster than growth in the overall economy 
more recently the market growth has slowed as a result of a decrease in consumer spending 
however we anticipate increasing demand for veterinary services due to the following favorable factors number of households with companion animals 
the number of households with companion animals is steadily expanding which increases the demand for veterinary services 
today  the percentages of us households owning dogs  cats and horses are   and  respectively 
veterinary expenditures per household 
the amount pet owners are willing to spend caring for their pets is increasing substantially

many new therapeutic and preventive products are being developed for the companion animal market 
technological developments have resulted in new innovative veterinary products and advances in veterinary services 
strategy webster s objective is to build a leading national position in the companion animal veterinary market through internal expansion and acquisitions  while continuing to improve our profitability and enhance our value to customers 
our key strategies and priorities for accomplishing these objectives include growing through internal expansion and acquisitions  emphasizing our value added full service capabilities  continuing to improve operating efficiencies  and expanding our service offerings 
growing through internal expansion and acquisitions 
we intend to continue to grow by opening additional sales offices  hiring established sales representatives  hiring and training skilled sales professionals as territory sales representatives  and acquiring other distributors in order to enter new  or more deeply penetrate existing  geographic markets and expand our customer base

our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and improve customer relationships through personal interaction with our field sales and customer service representatives and frequent direct marketing contact  which underscores our value added approach 
webster currently has local offices throughout the us so that we can provide a presence in the market and decision making near the customer 
these offices  or branches  are staffed with a complete complement of webster s capabilities  including sales  customer service and technical service personnel  as well as a local manager who has broad decision making authority with regard to customer related transactions and issues 
field sales representatives 
a primary component of webster s value added approach is our sales force 
due to the fragmented nature of the veterinary supply market  we believe that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service 
sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry  assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories 
each sales representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location branch manager 
sales representatives are all webster employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis  with some  less experienced  representatives receiving a base salary and commission 
customer service representative 
we support our field sales representatives and direct marketing efforts with customer service representatives in ten call centers covering the united states 
as of april   we had customer service representatives 
customer service representatives work in tandem with our field sales representatives  providing a dual coverage approach for individual customers 
in addition to processing orders  customer service representatives are responsible for assisting customers with ordering  informing customers of monthly promotions  and responding to general inquiries 
customer service representatives utilize our customized order entry system to process customer orders  access pricing  determine product availability  provide promotional information about products  research customer preferences  and review order histories 

table of contents direct marketing 
to assist our sales representatives  webster publishes a catalog containing product and service information 
webster customers receive a full line product catalog containing over  inventoried items 
the catalog includes pictures of products  detailed descriptions and specifications of products and is used by practitioners as a reference source 
we also promote selected consumable products  our value added program and services  new products  specially priced items and high demand items through our monthly magazine  insight 
additional direct marketing tools that we utilize include equipment catalogs  customer loyalty programs  specific product and vendor programs  flyers  faxes  and other promotional materials 
in order to extend our customer reach and enhance customer interaction  we also participate in national  regional and local trade shows 
e commerce platform 
webster s website allows customers the ability to order items hours a day  seven days a week 
the website also incorporates value added functions that permit customers to check their invoice  payment and credit history  build a shopping list of frequently purchased items and track their order status 
distribution webster believes that responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment is key to customer satisfaction 
we ship veterinary consumable supplies from strategically located distribution centers in the united states 
orders for veterinary consumable supplies can be placed through our field sales force  customer service representatives or electronically hours a day  seven days a week 
printed office products are shipped from patterson s manufacturing and distribution facility in central illinois 
all orders are routed through our centralized computer ordering  shipping and inventory management systems  which are linked to each of our strategically located distribution centers 
if an item is not available in the distribution center nearest to the customer  the computer system automatically directs fulfillment of the item from another center 
rapid and accurate order fulfillment is another principal component of our value added approach 
we estimate that of webster s consumable orders are received by the customer the next business day 
in order to assure the availability of webster s broad product lines for prompt delivery to customers  we must maintain sufficient inventories at our distribution centers 
purchasing of consumables and standard equipment is centralized  and our purchasing department uses a real time perpetual inventory system to manage inventory levels 
our inventory consists mostly of consumable supply items and pharmaceutical products 
by utilizing computerized inventory management and ordering systems  we are able to accurately predict inventory turns in order to minimize inventory levels for each item 
sources of supply webster obtains products from nearly vendors 
while webster makes purchases from many vendors and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products  the concentration of business with key vendors is considerable 
in fiscal and  webster s top veterinary supply manufacturers comprised  and the single largest supplier comprised  of the total cost of veterinary supply sales 
there are two major types of arrangements that account for the flow of transactions between us and our customers 
traditional buy sell transactions  which account for the vast majority of our business  involve direct purchases of products by us from vendors  which we manage and store in our distribution centers 
a customer then places an order with us  and the order is then picked  packed  shipped and billed by us to our customer 
we also process orders from our customers under agency agreements with some of our vendors  primarily for certain seasonal pharmaceutical products 
under this model  when we receive orders for products from the customer  we transmit the order to the vendor who then picks  packs  and ships the products 
the vendor then invoices and collects payment from our customer 
we receive a commission payment for soliciting the order and for providing other customer service activities 

table of contents competition the distribution and manufacture of veterinary products is highly competitive 
in addition to two other national  full service firms  butler schein animal health  inc and mwi veterinary supply  inc  webster competes with several full service distributors that operate on a regional level and numerous smaller local and specialty distributors and to lesser extent  mail order distributors or buying groups 
webster also competes directly with pharmaceutical companies who sell certain products directly to the customer 
webster approaches its markets by emphasizing and delivering a value added model to the practitioner 
to differentiate our self from our competition we deploys a strategy of premium customer service  a highly qualified and motivated sales force  an extensive breadth and mix of products and services  accurate and timely delivery of product  strategic location of sales offices and competitive pricing

patterson medical s goal is to become our customers first choice for rehabilitation supplies and equipment in each of our chosen markets 
patterson medical is highly diversified with no single product  customer or purchasing group representing a significant percentage of total revenue 
in addition  given the relatively small average order size approximately  our products often do not represent a major expense category for our customers 
patterson medical has been pursuing a strategy of organic growth  complemented by strategic acquisitions in its domestic and international markets 
this has included building and buying branch offices in the us  and buying and integrating distributors in the uk  france  and australia 
patterson medical also uses a robust international dealer network to service customers in countries where we do not have an established direct presence 
approximately of patterson medical s revenue originates in north america 
patterson medical manufactures or has exclusively manufactured for us products representing approximately of our total revenue 
these products carry the patterson medical brand  or one of the many brands added through acquisition 
patterson medical owns manufacturing facilities in the us  france  the us 
table of contents australia  and thailand  and has a china sourcing office 
patterson medical is a distributor for the other of our product offering  carrying the top brands in the rehabilitation industry 
one of patterson medical s strengths is our trading relationship with the top manufacturers of rehabilitation products in the us and abroad 
we believe the rehabilitation medical supply and assistive product industry is approximately billion worldwide and is expected to grow faster than the overall economy over the next several years 
industry growth is driven by strong growth in the physical and occupational therapy markets and favorable demographic trends associated with the aging of the baby boom generation 
we do not participate in all product segments  so patterson medical s addressable market defined as the collective market for products sold by patterson medical is approximately billion worldwide 
we believe that patterson medical has an industry leading market share of approximately in a highly fragmented rehabilitation and assistive products market 
we believe that the demand for rehabilitation products will continue to be influenced by the following factors favorable demographics 
favorable demographic trends such as extended life expectancy  active lifestyles and a general willingness to spend discretionary income on health care and well being  are expected to contribute to increased demand for products distributed by patterson medical 
specifically  the aging baby boomer population  together with their increased disposable income and desire for independence  will fuel product purchases to assist with the frailties associated with old age and provide sustained sales growth 
the us census bureau has projected the and older population in the us to increase significantly  from less than million in to million by and million by the to year old population is expected to more than double between and current trends indicate that these age groups represent the majority of home and community based health care patients 
the aging of the population is a revenue growth driver because approximately of people over the age of and approximately of people over the age of need assistance with everyday activities 
patterson medical believes we are well positioned to benefit from this trend by providing aids to daily living  namely dressing devices  toileting  dining  bathing aids  and grooming devices  all of which promote greater patient independence  improved patient responsibility and improved responsiveness to treatment 
increasing number of pts and ots  patterson medical s primary user groups 
according to the us department of labor bureau of labor statistics bls  there were approximately  pts and  ots in the us in approximately percent of pts were employed in either hospitals or offices of physical therapists 
the remaining percent of pts was employed in home health agencies  outpatient rehabilitation clinics  physician offices and nursing homes 
the majority of ots work in hospitals  including many in rehabilitation and psychiatric hospitals 
the remaining ots work in outpatient occupational therapy offices and clinics  schools  home health agencies  nursing homes  community mental health centers  adult day care programs  job training services and residential care facilities 
the demand for pts and ots is expected to remain strong 
the bls estimates a growth of for ots between and  and a growth of for pts in that same time period 
both professions are expected to grow much faster than average 
increasing frequency of reconstructive and implant surgery 
another important driver of the growth in the pt market is the growing need for rehabilitation products resulting from the increasing frequency of reconstructive implant procedures  including hip and knee replacements 
the worldwide reconstructive implant market is currently in excess of billion and expected to grow between and annually 
this growth trajectory is largely driven by favorable demographics  as patient populations are expanding at both ends of the age spectrum 
among seniors  more active lifestyles and longer life expectancies are responsible for the increasing frequency of reconstructive implants 
we believe patterson medical is well positioned to benefit from the growth in reconstructive implants  by providing physical therapy and exercise products that help the patients return to a normal level of function 

table of contents volatility in funding and regulation 
the demographic growth in aged population both in the us and abroad will continue to pose funding challenges for governments 
whether private pay  medicare  medicaid or some other funding mechanism  the population need has been outpacing the available funds 
this has resulted in governments changing funding methods  allocations  and rules to try and better match supply with demand 
although we do not directly participate in third party reimbursed patient specific product  the pressure on healthcare providers can have a pass through effect 
patterson medical has pursued a diversified strategy so we do not rely too heavily on any one product category

risk factors the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully  in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
the risks that follow  individually or in the aggregate  are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forward looking statements 
continuing uncertain economic conditions and volatility in the financial markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
continued recessionary trends in the us or global economy  or an uncertain economic outlook  could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
unfavorable economic conditions may continue to cause customers to reduce  modify  delay  or cancel purchasing our products and services  and a prolonged period of economic instability could reduce their ability to make payments 
furthermore  such conditions could cause our suppliers to reduce their production  decrease their number of product offerings  or change their terms of sale to us 
increasing commodity prices would also increase our cost of operations  either directly through increased energy costs or indirectly through what we are charged by our suppliers 
unfavorable economic conditions could also cause changes in our product mix as our customers prioritize established  low margin products rather than innovative  high margin products  which could reduce our profit margin 
in addition  volatility and other disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect the cost and availability of credit to us  as well as the cost of  and ability to sell finance contracts we receive from customers to outside financial institutions 
reduced access to capital for our customers limits the amount of investment that they can make in their practices  and with limited investment by the customer our revenues from equipment sales would be lower 
the dental supply  veterinary supply  and rehabilitation and assistive products supply markets are highly fragmented and competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
our competitors include national  regional and local full service distributors  mail order distributors and  increasingly  internet based businesses 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we do  or operate through different sales and distribution models that could allow them to compete more successfully 
for example  many of our suppliers are manufacturers  some of whom compete with us by selling directly to customers 
furthermore  internet based businesses may be able to offer the same product at a lower cost 
most of our products are available from multiple sources  and our customers tend to have relationships with several different distributors who can fulfill their orders 
our competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products  which we would then be unable to market 
manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors 
industry consolidation among suppliers  price competition  the unavailability of products  whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers  or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition 
our failure to compete effectively may limit and or reduce our revenue  profitability and cash flow 

table of contents risks inherent in acquiring other businesses could offset the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may face difficulty in efficiently and effectively integrating acquired businesses since we operate in three distinct segments 
as a part of our business strategy  we have acquired businesses in the ordinary course and expect to continue acquiring businesses in the future 
these acquisitions can involve a number of risks and challenges  any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability 
such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition  unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources  difficulty in integrating personnel  operations and systems  retention of customers of the combined businesses  assumption of contingent liabilities  and acquisition related earnings charges 
our ability to continue to make acquisitions will depend upon our success in identifying suitable targets  which requires substantial judgment in assessing their values  strengths  weaknesses  liabilities and potential profitability  as well as the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices  and whether restrictions are imposed by anti trust or other regulations 
in addition  our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect because of difficulties integrating the acquired businesses  including their personnel  customers  operations and systems 
as we operate in three distinct segments  we need to consolidate the distribution  information technology  human resources  financial and other administrative functions of those business units jointly to meet their needs while addressing distinctions in the individual markets of those segments 
we may not be able to do so effectively and efficiently 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results 
there are a number of risks inherent in foreign operations  including complex regulatory requirements  staffing and management complexities  import and export costs  other economic factors and political considerations subject to unanticipated changes 
additionally  foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations 
furthermore  we generally do not hedge translation exposure with respect to foreign operations 
we depend on our relationships with our sales representatives and customers  as well as suppliers of the products that we distribute 
the inability to attract or retain qualified employees  particularly sales representatives who relate directly with our customers  or our inability to build or maintain relationships with suppliers of products that we distribute may have an adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on our suppliers because we do not manufacture the majority of the products we sell 
interruptions in supply could adversely affect our operating results 
if a supplier is unable to deliver product in a timely and efficient manner  whether due to financial difficulties  natural disasters or other reasons  we could experience lost sales 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our suppliers that commit them to producing products for us 
while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell  there is considerable concentration within our veterinary and dental businesses with a few key suppliers 
for example  in fiscal and  webster s top veterinary supply manufacturers were both comprised of  respectively  and the single largest supplier was comprised  respectively  of the total cost of veterinary supply sales 
in the event that any of our suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products we sell in the amounts we require  we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis 
there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis  if at all 
an extended interruption in the supply of our products would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents in addition  a portion of our products are sourced  directly or indirectly  from outside the united states 
political or financial instability  increased tariffs  restrictions on trade  currency exchange rates  labor unrest  outbreak of pandemics or other events could slow distribution activities and affect foreign trade beyond our control and adversely affect our results of operations 
the products we sell are subject to market and technological obsolescence 
we carry over  different product stock keeping units skus 
some of these products are subject to technological obsolescence outside of our control  since we do not manufacture the majority of the products we sell 
if our customers discontinue purchasing a given product  we might have to record expense related to the diminution in value of inventories we have in stock  and depending on the magnitude  that expense could adversely impact our operating results 
audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal  state and local tax authorities and by non us tax authorities 
if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves  our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 
we are subject to a variety of litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business  including product liability claims  intellectual property claims  and employment claims 
we also may be subject to securities litigation 
defending these lawsuits may divert our management s attention  may be expensive  and may require that we pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposure 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements  or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us  could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation 
our future success depends on our leadership development and succession planning 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to recruit skilled personnel  and then identify and train our personnel to transition into key roles to support the long term growth of our business 
while our board of directors and management actively monitor our succession plans and processes  our business could suffer if we lose key personnel unexpectedly 
in addition  competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
if impairment of our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets is determined  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period of such determination under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the healthcare industry is experiencing substantial changes  which are causing uncertainty in the market and may adversely affect our dental and rehabilitation and assistive products supply businesses 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including trends toward managed care  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies  
table of contents consolidation of healthcare manufacturers  collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office based healthcare practitioners that may enable purchasing at more favorable prices than we can obtain and may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship  and changes in reimbursements to customers 
our profit margins and the profit margins of our suppliers and our customers may be adversely affected by industry changes 
if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in particular  recent healthcare related legislation and regulation in the us may affect expenditures or reimbursements for rehabilitation and assistive products or expenditures or reimbursements for dental services by private dental insurance plans 
other new regulatory requirements could subject us to additional reporting and disclosure requirements  taxes  and or restrictions 
regulations under healthcare reform legislation continue to be in flux  resulting in uncertainty surrounding their application and related enforcement  as well as consuming resources necessary to comply 
healthcare markets are rapidly changing  as well 
for example  our assumptions concerning future per capita expenditures for dental services  including assumptions as to population growth and the demand for preventive and specialty dental services such as periodontic  endodontic and orthodontic procedures  may be mistaken 
fluctuations in demand for infection control products currently used for prevention of the spread of communicable diseases such as aids  hepatitis and herpes may adversely affect our revenue 
failure to comply with existing and future us and foreign laws and regulatory requirements could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 
the marketing  distribution and sale of certain products we sell are subject to the requirements of various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the us and abroad 
our failure to comply with applicable laws may subject us to claims  additional liabilities  or enforcement actions by an administrative agency  which could require us to make settlement payments  be subject to civil or criminal penalties including fines or loss of licenses  or damage our reputation  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the us  we are subject to regulation by the federal food and drug administration  the drug enforcement administration and the us department of transportation 
among the federal laws which impact our business are the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  which regulates the advertising  record keeping  labeling  handling  storage and sale of drugs and medical devices we distribute  and which requires us to be registered with the federal food and drug administration  the safe medical devices act  which imposes certain reporting requirements on us in the event of an incident involving serious illness  injury or death caused by a medical device we distributed  and the controlled substance act  which regulates the record keeping  handling  storage and sale of certain drugs we sell  and which requires us to be registered with the drug enforcement administration 
in addition  the transportation of certain products we distribute that are considered hazardous materials is subject to regulation by the us department of transportation 
we are also required to be licensed as a distributor of drugs and medical devices by each state in which we conduct business 
in addition  several state boards of pharmacy require us to be licensed for the sale of animal health products within their jurisdiction 
we are also subject to the requirements of foreign laws and regulations  which impact our operations in those foreign countries where we conduct business 
furthermore  as discussed above  the industries in which we operate have recently experienced an increase in new regulations  which makes compliance increasingly difficult 
costs and resources associated with complying with these increasing regulations can be considerable 
we are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates 
our balance sheet includes certain non current assets that are sensitive to movements in short term interest rates 
the variable rates are comprised of both libor and commercial paper rates plus a spread and reset on 
table of contents certain dates  as set forth in the respective agreements 
in addition  our balance sheet includes fixed rate long term debt  whose fair value could be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
we finance purchases by our customers using finance contracts that are issued at fixed interest rates  and sell these contracts under various funding arrangements that are priced using variable interest rates 
sudden and dramatic changes in the interest rates within relevant markets could adversely affect our results of operations 
risks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on information systems is in our business to obtain  rapidly process  analyze and manage data to  among other things maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers  receive  process and ship orders on a timely basis  manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers  and process payments to suppliers 
a cyber attack that bypasses our is security causing an is security breach may lead to a material disruption of our is and or the loss of business information  which could adversely affect our business 
these risks may include  among others  the following future results could be adversely affected due to the theft  destruction  loss  misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property  operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of is and subsequent clean up and mitigation activities  and negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers  suppliers or industry peers 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if our is are interrupted  damaged by unforeseen events  cyber attacks or fail for any extended period of time 
our governing documents and minnesota law may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 
anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws  and minnesota law could diminish the opportunity for shareholders to participate in acquisition proposals at a price above the then current market price of our common stock 
for example  while we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock  our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  may issue up to approximately million shares of undesignated preferred stock and fix the powers  preferences  rights and limitations of such class or series  which could adversely affect the voting power of our common stock 
in addition  our bylaws divide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms 
further  as a minnesota corporation  we are subject to provisions of the minnesota business corporation act  or mbca  regarding control share acquisitions and business combinations 
we may  in the future  consider adopting additional anti takeover measures 
the authority of our board of directors to issue undesignated preferred stock and the anti takeover provisions of the mbca  as well as any future anti takeover measures adopted by us  may  in certain circumstances  delay  deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of our company not approved by our board of directors

we maintain product liability insurance coverage for any potential liability for claims arising out of products we sell 
while we believe our insurance coverage is adequate  there can be no assurance that the insurance maintained is sufficient or will be available to us in adequate amounts or at reasonable costs in the future 
also  there can be no assurance that the indemnification agreements we have with our suppliers will provide us with adequate protection 
in addition  future claims brought against us could involve claims not covered by insurance or indemnification agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
as of april   we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to product liability and other claims likely to result in liability and for which it is possible to reasonably estimate a loss

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our fiscal financial information is summarized in this management s discussion and analysis  consolidated financial statements  and related notes 
the following background is essential to more fully understand our company s financial information 
patterson operates a distribution business in three complementary markets dental supply  veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply 
historically our strategy for growth focused on internal growth and the acquisition of smaller distributors and businesses offering related products and services to the dental market 
in fiscal  we expanded our strategy to take advantage of a parallel growth opportunity in the veterinary supply market by acquiring the assets of j 
a 
webster  inc on july  patterson added a third component to our business platform in fiscal when it entered the rehabilitation supply market with the acquisition of abilityone products corp 
abilityone on september  abilityone is now known as patterson medical 
operating margins of the veterinary business are considerably lower than the dental and rehabilitation supply businesses 
while operating expenses run at a lower rate in the veterinary business  their gross margin is substantially lower 
there are several important aspects of patterson s business that are useful in analyzing it  including market growth in the various markets in which we operate  internal growth  growth through acquisition  and continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency 
management defines internal growth as the increase in net sales from period to period  excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  and excluding the net sales  for a period of twelve months following the transaction date  of businesses we have acquired 
there are two matters that have an overriding impact on our financial results for fiscal first  we operate with a week accounting convention with our fiscal year ending on the last saturday in april 
fiscal year included weeks  with an additional  or fourteenth  week included in the first quarter ended july  fiscal ending april  included weeks  and the first quarter operations included thirteen weeks of activity compared to the prior year period which contained weeks 
it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of the extra week  but estimates have been provided in those areas where it is possible to make reasonable approximations 
we estimate that the impact of the extra week reduced sales growth by one or two percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal the second matter involves the level of expense associated with our employee stock ownership plan esop 
for the past twenty years allocations of shares to employees have been made almost entirely from shares of company stock acquired by the esop in the shares 
although the accounting standards in effect in were subsequently revised  the accounting for the shares was grandfathered under the revised standards and called for the expensing of the shares released for allocation to employees to be based on the original cost of the shares 
the revised standards require the expensing of shares released to be based on fair value of the shares at the time they are committed to be released and since the revision of the accounting standards  the esop has acquired approximately million additional shares  nearly all of which are still held for future allocation to employees 
as the final allocation of the shares was made at the end of fiscal  the esop shares that have been subsequently acquired will be released and allocated to employees in fiscal and beyond 
when these shares are committed to be released to employees  it will result in a non cash expense equal to the average fair value of the shares committed to be released 
the esop expense increased our operating expenses by approximately million and per diluted share in fiscal as compared to fiscal this change from historical cost to fair value in recognizing esop expense creates a comparability discrepancy between our past and foreseeable future operating results 

table of contents the following table presents the esop expense reconciliation for comparability purposes three months ended twelve months ended april  april  april  april  net income incremental esop expense adjusted net income non gaap diluted earnings per share incremental esop expense adjusted earnings per share non gaap in fiscal  we made a cash contribution of approximately million to the esop  which was then used by the esop to acquire shares through open market purchases 
we instructed the esop trustee to hold these shares in suspense for allocation to employees at the end of the current esop fiscal year 
since the fiscal contribution to the esop was made in cash as opposed to using shares previously acquired by the esop  the expense for the current fiscal year will be a cash expense to us 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million 
through these repurchases and the cash dividends  we returned nearly million of value to our shareholders 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations over the past three fiscal years as a percent of sales net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses operating income other income  net interest expense income before taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal as described in the overview section above  the first quarter of fiscal included an extra week due to the company s fiscal year convention 
accordingly  the fiscal year ended april  included weeks while the fiscal year ended april  included weeks 
as noted above  we estimate that the impact of the extra week reduced sales growth by one to two percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents net sales 
consolidated net sales in fiscal were  million  an increase of  from  million in fiscal the growth in sales includes a contribution from acquisitions and a favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates 
excluding the impact of the extra week  consolidated sales grew an estimated 
dental segment sales in fiscal rose to  million from  million in fiscal the impact of currency translation rates was a favorable 
consumable sales increased  although they remained sluggish due to continuing weak general economic trends  low consumer confidence and high unemployment 
dental equipment and software sales increased in fiscal to million 
sales of technology oriented equipment  including digital radiography and cad cam products  accounted for the growth 
revenues from the sale of basic dental equipment infrastructure  primarily consisting of chairs  power units and cabinetry  continued to be soft in fiscal  as practitioners focused purchases on products that they believed gave them higher returns in the near term 
other dental sales  consisting primarily of technical service parts and labor  software support services and artificial teeth  increased in fiscal webster sales grew to million 
sales of consumables were higher in fiscal and equipment and software sales of million represented an increase of compared to fiscal acquisitions added to sales in fiscal consumable sales in this segment have benefited from a higher percentage of pharmaceutical sales made under buy sell versus agency distribution agreements  and an earlier and more severe flea and tick season 
we have been investing in the veterinary segment s equipment and technical service offering to expand this unit s full service platform 
patterson medical sales of million were higher than fiscal acquisitions  contributed of sales growth 
the positive impact from foreign currency translation rates was in fiscal the capital equipment portion of this segment was negatively impacted by uncertainty in the market caused by regulatory changes in healthcare gross margin 
consolidated gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal the dental segment s gross margin decreased basis points to in fiscal this decrease is mainly due to sales mix as equipment growth outpaced consumable growth during the year 
gross margin of the veterinary unit was  a decrease of basis points from in fiscal sales mix was the primary factor in the decline as a higher percentage of revenue came from pharmaceutical sales  which have a lower margin 
patterson medical s gross margin declined basis points to 
this was driven by a slight decrease in point of sale margin and an increase in freight rates  both domestically and internationally 
operating expenses 
the consolidated operating expense ratio in fiscal was  or basis points higher than fiscal on a comparable basis  after adjusting for the increase in the esop expense discussed above  the operating expense ratio would have been  or a decrease of nearly basis points 
the dental unit s operating expense ratio increased basis points as this unit absorbs the majority of the esop expense 
in addition  this segment was investing in training of sales personnel and deploying a new order entry system 
the ratio of the veterinary unit s operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased basis in the current year largely due to leverage of the higher sales levels 
patterson medical s operating expense ratio decreased in fiscal the segment benefited from further integration of recent acquisitions and aggressive expense management 

table of contents operating income 
operating income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal adjusting for the esop expense impact  operating income would have increased year over year 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is due to the issuance of million of debt in the third quarter of the current year 
the company made the decision to raise additional debt capital to take advantage of the favorable rate environment 
other income  net 
other income  net of other expenses  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest income totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal during fiscal the company carried higher average balances of finance contracts while we modified agreements with our funding sources in the period 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in the deductible dividends paid on shares held by our employee stock ownership plan and the release of reserves resulting from expiring statute of limitations 
net income and earnings per share 
net income decreased to million in fiscal due primarily to the increase in operating expense as discussed above 
adjusting for the impact of the extra week on fiscal and the incremental esop expense in fiscal  net income would have increased approximately 
earnings per diluted share and dilutive shares outstanding were and million  respectively  in fiscal and and million  respectively  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
consolidated net sales in fiscal were  million  an increase of from  million in fiscal the growth in sales includes a contribution from acquisitions and a favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates 
fiscal also included an additional or fifty third week due to our fiscal year convention of ending on the last saturday in april 
it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of this additional week  but estimates have been provided in those areas where it is possible to make reasonable approximations 
the impact of the extra week on consolidated sales is estimated to have been approximately one and a half percent 
dental segment sales in fiscal rose to  million from  million in fiscal acquisitions added to sales and the impact of currency translation rates was a favorable 
consumable sales increased  although they were affected by uneven patient demand for dental services as a result of the weak economy 
while the economic recovery has been slow  it is believed the fundamentals of the north american dental market continued to strengthen as fiscal progressed 
dental equipment and software sales increased in fiscal to million 
sales of basic dental equipment and software grew  led by sales of digital sensors and cone beam and panoramic imaging systems 
sales of cerec dental systems declined 
as market fundamentals have started to improve  dentists are believed to have gradually become more confident about investing in their practices 
in addition  additional marketing programs were implemented at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal these two factors helped in reaching sales growth of in the fourth quarter 
other dental sales  consisting primarily of technical service parts and labor  software support services and artificial teeth  increased in fiscal webster veterinary sales grew to million 
sales of consumables were higher in fiscal and equipment and software sales of million represented an increase of compared to fiscal the veterinary equipment business has been growing at solid rates in recent quarters  and we intend to 
table of contents continue investing in this relatively new portion of webster s operation that has expanded the unit s full service platform 
patterson medical sales of million were higher than fiscal acquisitions  primarily that of the health care business of dcc plc  contributed of sales growth 
internally generated sales growth  which excludes the contribution of acquisitions and a negative impact from foreign currency translation rates  was in fiscal gross margin 
consolidated gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal the dental segment s gross margin decreased basis points to in fiscal lower vendor rebates and a higher level of promotional activities as compared to fiscal contributed to the decline 
gross margin of the veterinary unit was  a decrease of basis points from in fiscal price increases on a line of pharmaceutical products by a manufacturer and lower vendor rebates were primary factors in the decline in gross margin 
patterson medical s gross margin of its historical operations expanded during fiscal  however  these improvements were offset by the lower gross margins of the dcc healthcare acquisitions 
for the year  gross margin declined basis points to 
operating expenses 
the consolidated operating expense ratio in fiscal was  or basis points lower than fiscal the dental unit s operating expense ratio decreased basis points  reflecting expense controls and leverage gained from higher sales on fixed costs 
the ratio of the veterinary unit s operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased basis points  due to leverage on higher sales and cost savings from the integration of the october  columbus serum acquisition 
those integration activities were completed in fiscal patterson medical s operating expense ratio increased basis points in fiscal due to the cost structure of the dcc acquisition 
integration of the dcc entities has progressed throughout the year and is largely complete

other income  net of other expenses  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to losses related to the veterinary unit s equity interest in vetsource 
interest income totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal a portion of the dividends paid on shares held by our employee stock ownership plan are deductible on our income tax return 
as there were more dividends paid in fiscal than in fiscal  the deductible amount was larger  resulting in a lower effective income tax rate in fiscal net income and earnings per share 
net income increased to million in fiscal due primarily to the increase in operating income as discussed above 
earnings per diluted share and dilutive shares outstanding were and  respectively  in fiscal and and million  respectively  in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources patterson s operating cash flow has been our principal source of liquidity in the last three fiscal years 
during fiscal  we used our revolving credit facility periodically as a source of liquidity in addition to operating cash flow 
operating activities generated cash of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  and  we invested in financing programs to support marketing efforts directed at the equipment product lines  particularly in the dental segment 
capital expenditures were  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
significant expenditures in these years included the purchase and expansion of distribution facilities to accommodate multiple business units  the construction of a new facility for the patterson technology center  the expansion of the general office building and continuing investments in information systems 
in fiscal  a project to build out a purchased building in indiana was completed  the building serves as a distribution facility used by all three business units 
this facility is replacing several smaller distribution facilities 
in addition  the patterson technology center facility in illinois was completed in fiscal this  square foot state of the art facility replaced a nearby leased location and opened in the second quarter of fiscal we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during fiscal  our main investment is in information systems 
cash used for acquisitions and equity investments totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the majority of the cash used for acquisitions in fiscal related to the acquisitions of avsc and surgical synergies 
the medical segment s acquisition of the healthcare assets of dcc plc 
accounted for the majority of the cash used in fiscal  while the acquisition of the rehabilitation business of empi therapy solutions and the investment in strategic pharm dba vetsource accounted for the majority of the cash used in fiscal in fiscal we entered in to a new debt agreement for million  see note of the consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
footnote for further information 
there were neither issuances of  nor payments on  debt during fiscal in fiscal  patterson fully paid the million that was outstanding under a revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal a maximum of million is available under this facility  which expires in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we declared and paid an initial quarterly cash dividend of per share  which was increased to per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the dividend continued at this rate through the third quarter of fiscal the dividend was increased to per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal total dividends paid in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future 
in addition  during fiscal we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million 
in fiscal we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million 
under a share repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors  as of april   patterson may repurchase up to an additional million shares of its common stock 
this authorization remains in effect through march  management expects funds generated from operations and existing cash to be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next fiscal year 
we have approximately million in foreign bank accounts 
none of which are subject to any withdrawal restrictions 
see note  income taxes for further information regarding our intention to permanently reinvest these funds 
we expect to continue to obtain liquidity from the sale of equipment finance contracts 
patterson s existing debt facilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives  including acquisitions 

table of contents patterson sells a significant portion of our finance contracts to a commercial paper funded conduit managed by a third party bank  and as a result  commercial paper is indirectly an important source of liquidity for patterson 
patterson is allowed to participate in the conduit due to the quality of our finance contracts and our financial strength 
cash flow could be impaired if our financial strength diminishes to a level that precluded us from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities 
also  market conditions outside of our control could adversely affect the ability for us to sell the contracts 
customer financing arrangements patterson is a party to two arrangements under which we have sold finance contracts received from our customers to outside financial institutions 
these arrangements provide sources of liquidity for us that would have to be replaced should any of the current financial institutions be unable or unwilling to continue under them 
in december  the receivables purchase agreement was amended to make the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj  ltd 
btmu the managing agent 
as of april   the capacity under this agreement is million  million with btmu and the remainder with royal bank of canada

replaced us bank national association as the agent under the contract purchase agreement  which has a capacity of million as of april  our financing business is described in further detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
note  customer financing  discusses the nature and business purpose of the arrangements and the activity under each arrangement during fiscal  including the amount of finance contracts sold and the holdback receivable owed to us 
contractual obligations a summary of patterson s contractual obligations as of april  follows in thousands payment due by year contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases patterson is unable to determine its contractual obligations by year related to the provisions of asc topic  income taxes  as the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of its reserves for income taxes cannot be reasonably estimated 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties at april   is million

outlook over the last ten years  we have been able to grow revenue and earnings through our strategy of emphasizing value added  full service capabilities  using technology to enhance customer service  continuing to improve operating efficiencies  and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions 
while the weakness in the general economy that has existed during much of fiscal and is expected to continue to affect our performance for at least the near term  patterson s strategy will continue to focus on these key elements 
with strong operating cash flow and available credit capacity  we are confident that we will be able to financially support our future growth 
we believe that the strategic initiatives that we have implemented in the past several years  as well as those that will be implemented in fiscal and beyond  will strengthen our operational 
table of contents platform and contribute to future growth 
given these factors  we consider ourself well positioned to capitalize upon the growth opportunities in the dental supply  companion animal veterinary supply and the worldwide rehabilitation supply markets 
asset management the following table summarizes patterson s days sales outstanding dso and inventory turnover the past three fiscal years days sales outstanding inventory turnover receivables as of april   april  and april  include approximately million  million and million  respectively  of finance contracts received from customers related to certain financing promotions in fiscal  and patterson has sold contracts in fiscal and expects to sell the contracts held as of april  to outside institutions under an existing agreement during fiscal if these finance contracts are excluded from the calculation of dso  the pro forma dso would be  and as of april   april  and april  the inventory values used in this calculation are the lifo inventory values for all inventories except for manufactured inventories and foreign inventories  which are valued using fifo inventory methods 
foreign operations foreign sales derive primarily from patterson dental and patterson medical operations in canada and from patterson medical operations in the uk and france 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted earnings 
however  changes in exchange rates enhanced net sales in fiscal and  and adversely affected net sales in fiscal without foreign currency effects  net sales would have been million lower  million lower  and million higher in fiscal years  and  respectively 
changes in currency exchange rates are a risk accompanying foreign operations  but this risk is not considered material with respect to our consolidated operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates patterson has adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management believes that our policies are conservative and our philosophy is to adopt accounting policies that minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments regarding the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities based on the information available to management at the time 
changes subsequent to the preparation of the financial statements in economic  technological and competitive conditions may materially impact the recorded values of patterson s assets and liabilities 
therefore  the users of the financial statements should read all the notes to the consolidated financial statements and be aware that conditions currently unknown to management may develop in the future 
this may require a material adjustment to a recorded asset or liability to consistently apply to our significant accounting principles and policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial performance and condition of patterson may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that we have not previously experienced and for which we have not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle 
revenue recognition revenues are generated from the sale of consumable products  equipment  software products and services  technical service parts and labor  freight and delivery charges  and other sources 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and final  and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sale 
estimates for returns  damaged goods  rebates  loyalty programs and other revenue allowances are made at the time the revenue is recognized based on the historical experience for such items 

table of contents consumable product sales are recorded upon delivery  except in those circumstances where terms of the sale are fob shipping point 
equipment and software product revenues are recognized upon delivery and  if necessary  installation 
in those circumstances where terms of the sale are fob shipping point  revenues are recognized when products are transferred to the shipping carrier 
revenue derived from post contract customer support for software is deferred and recognized ratably over the period in which the support is provided 
revenue for arrangements with multiple deliverables meeting the criteria for a separate unit of accounting use the relative fair value method and revenue is recognized for each deliverable in accordance with applicable revenue recognition criteria 
other revenue including freight and delivery charges and technical service parts and labor is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the product or services are provided to the customer 
patterson advantage loyalty program patterson dental provides a point based awards program to qualifying customers involving the issuance of patterson advantage dollars which can be used toward equipment and technology purchases 
the program was initiated on january  and runs on a calendar year schedule 
patterson advantage dollars earned during a program year expire one year after the end of the program year 
the cost and corresponding liability associated with the program is recognized as contra revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition customer payments and incentives 
as of april   we believe we have sufficient experience with the program to reasonably estimate the amount of patterson advantage dollars that will not be redeemed  thus have recorded a liability for of the maximum potential amount that could be redeemed 
we use the redemption recognition method and we recognize the estimated value of unused advantage dollars as a percentage of patterson advantage as redemptions occur 
breakage recognized was immaterial to all periods presented 
inventory and reserves inventory consists primarily of merchandise held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for all inventories  except for foreign inventories and manufactured inventories  which are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
we continually assess the valuation of inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to estimated realizable value 
estimates are made of the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other indefinite lived intangible assets include copyrights  trade names and trademarks 
goodwill for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step impairment test at the reporting unit level 
patterson has three reporting units at april   which are the same as our operating units 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value  as determined by its discounted cash flows 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recorded 
the determination of fair value involves uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
patterson conducts impairment testing based on current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
additionally  in assessing goodwill for impairment  the reasonableness of the implied control premium is considered based on market capitalizations and recent market transactions 
other indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of an asset with its fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the determination of fair value involves assumptions  including projected revenues and gross profit levels  as well as consideration of any factors that may indicate potential impairment 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal  management completed its annual goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests and determined there was no impairment 
although we believe estimates and assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such estimates and assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and financial results  including an impairment charge that could be material 
long lived assets long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 
our definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of an exclusive distribution agreement and customer lists 
when impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite our belief  our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made and could materially affect our financial results 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes would have increased decreased by percent of income before taxes  consolidated net income would have decreased increased million in fiscal valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets if  after assessment of available positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be fully realized 
the valuation allowance reflected in the footnote disclosure relates to net operating loss carryforwards of mobilis healthcare group  acquired during fiscal and principally based in the united kingdom 
self insurance patterson is self insured for certain losses related to general liability  product liability  automobile  workers compensation and medical claims 
we estimate our liabilities based upon an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
while current estimates are believed reasonable based on information currently available  actual results could differ and affect financial results due to changes in the amount or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation or other factors 
historically  actual results related to these types of claims have not varied significantly from estimated amounts 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation based on certain assumptions including inputs within the black scholes model and estimated forfeitures 
these assumptions require subjective judgment and changes in the assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates 
management assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate forfeitures and to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation on a regular basis 
circumstances may change  and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact the fair value determination or estimates of forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  the amount of compensation expense associated with stock based compensation may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk consisting of foreign currency rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
patterson is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in its operating statement due to transactions denominated primarily in canadian dollars  british pounds  euros  australian dollars and new zealand dollars 
although patterson is not currently involved with foreign currency hedge contracts  it continually evaluates our foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms for use in managing such risk 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have reduced fiscal net sales by approximately million 
this amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impact of the currency exchange movements on cost of sales and operating expenses 
patterson s earnings are also affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates through the investment of cash balances  borrowings under libor based debt instruments and the practice of selling fixed rate equipment finance contracts under agreements with both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks that provide for pricing based on variable interest rates 
as of april   we had a million variable rate term note outstanding 
we view our variable interest rate debt position on a net basis that gives effect to our cash and cash equivalents balances 
when considering the exposure under the agreements whereby patterson sells equipment finance contracts to both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks  patterson has the ability to select pricing based on interest rates ranging from day libor up to twelve month libor 
in addition  the majority of the portfolio of installment contracts generally turns over in less than months and patterson can adjust the rate we charge on new customer contracts at any time 
therefore  in times where the interest rate markets are not rapidly increasing or decreasing  the average interest rate in the portfolio generally moves with the interest rate markets and thus would parallel the underlying interest rate movement of the pricing built into the sale agreements 
in calculating the gain on the contract sales  we use an interest rate curve that approximates the maturity period of the then outstanding contracts 
if increases in the interest rate markets occur  the average interest rate in our contract portfolio may not increase at the same rate  resulting in a reduction of gain on the contracts sales as compared to the gain that would be realized if the average interest rate in our portfolio were to increase at a more similar rate to the interest rate markets 
patterson estimates that if interest rates had been higher during the year  the annual impact would have been to reduce earnings before income tax by less than million
