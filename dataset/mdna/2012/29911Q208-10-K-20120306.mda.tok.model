the fdic has adopted a risk based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution s ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios 
in addition  all fdic insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  a mixed ownership federal government corporation established to recapitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the current annualized assessment rate is basis points  or approximately basis points per quarter 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in pursuant to the dodd frank act  the deposit insurance assessment base was redefined in to reflect consolidated total assets less average tangible equity

dividends paid by the bank have been the company s primary source of operating funds and are expected to be for the foreseeable future 
capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank 
under occ regulations  the bank may not pay a dividend  without prior occ approval  if the total amount of all dividends declared during the calendar year  including the proposed dividend  exceed the sum of its retained net income to date during the calendar year and its retained net income over the preceding two years 
as of december   approximately million was available for the payment of dividends without prior occ approval 
the bank s ability 
table of contents to pay dividends is also subject to the bank being in compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
as indicated below  the bank is currently in compliance with these requirements 
because the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank  the company s right to participate in the distribution of assets of the bank in the event of the bank s liquidation or reorganization would be subject to the prior claims of the bank s creditors 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of unsecured  non deposit creditors  including a parent bank holding company such as the company or any shareholder or creditor thereof 
the frb  the occ and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers  including the power to terminate deposit insurance  to impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties  and to appoint a conservator or receiver for the assets of a regulated entity 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the company or its subsidiaries  as well as officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties of these organizations  to administrative sanctions and potential civil monetary penalties 
capital adequacy the frb  the fdic and the occ have adopted risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks under their supervision 
under these guidelines  the so called tier capital and total capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet instruments must be at least and  respectively 
the frb  the fdic and the occ have also imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk based ratios 
this leverage standard focuses on a banking institution s ratio of tier capital to average total assets  adjusted for goodwill and certain other items 
under these guidelines  banking institutions that meet certain criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and good earnings  and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of tier capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 
institutions not meeting these criteria  as well as institutions with supervisory  financial or operational weaknesses  along with those experiencing or anticipating significant growth  are expected to maintain a tier capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least 
as reflected in the following table  the risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as well capitalized  the highest classification under the regulatory capital guidelines

table of contents dollars in thousands company bank minimum for capital adequacy purposes minimum to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio total risk based capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to average assets the federal banking agencies  including the frb and the occ  maintain risk based capital standards in order to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk  the risk of non traditional activities and equity investments in non financial companies  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on certain multifamily housing loans 
bank regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk based capital guidelines and related regulatory framework  and consider changes to the risk based capital standards that could significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the requirements for the capital tiers described below 
while the company s management studies such proposals  the timing of adoption  ultimate form and effect of any such proposed amendments on the company s capital requirements and operations cannot be predicted 
the federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
the federal deposit insurance act established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier  or that of its bank holding company  depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures  including a risk based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure  and certain other factors 
under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies  a bank holding company or bank is considered well capitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for a capital measure 
an adequately capitalized bank holding company or bank is defined as one that has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater in the case of a bank with a composite camels rating of 
a bank holding company or bank is considered a undercapitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or in the case of a bank with a composite camels rating of  b significantly undercapitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than  and c critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 
the frb may reclassify a well capitalized bank holding company or bank as adequately capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency 
as of december   the company and the bank met the definition of well capitalized institutions 
undercapitalized depository institutions  among other things are subject to growth limitations  are prohibited  with certain exceptions  from making capital distributions  are limited in their ability to obtain funding from a federal reserve bank  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan and provide appropriate assurances of performance 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make the guarantee described in the previous sentence  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
failure to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan also is grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of additional requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from 
table of contents correspondent banks 
moreover  the parent holding company of a significantly undercapitalized depository institution may be ordered to divest itself of the institution or of non bank subsidiaries of the holding company 
critically undercapitalized institutions  among other things  are prohibited from making any payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt  and are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem appropriate 
the frb and the occ have adopted such standards 
regulation of insurance agency subsidiary tea is regulated by the new york state insurance department 
it meets and maintains all licensing and continuing education requirements required by the state of new york 
monetary policy and economic control the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary policies of the frb 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing  availability of borrowing at the discount window  open market operations  the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks deposits and assets of foreign branches and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb 
these monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans  investments and deposits  and this use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the monetary policies of the frb have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the monetary policies of these agencies are influenced by various factors  including inflation  unemployment  and short term and long term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the united states government 
future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted 
consumer laws and regulations in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks

the dodd frank act is organized around sixteen titles i 
financial stability creates a new oversight regulator  the financial stability oversight council 
the council of regulators will monitor the financial system for systemic risk and will determine which entities pose significant systemic risk 
one of the key provisions of this title is the so called collins amendment  which imposes a stricter application of risk based capital requirements for bank holding companies than was previously employed 
under the collins amendment  certain depository institutions will not be permitted to include trust preferred securities issued after may  in tier capital 
for depository institutions with greater than billion in assets  trust preferred securities issued before may  will be phased out as a component of tier capital over three years beginning january  evans bancorp

this title also includes a number of deposit insurance reforms 
the first redefines the deposit insurance assessment base to reflect consolidated total assets less average tangible equity 
the result is that larger financial institutions  which have more assets leveraged with non deposit wholesale funds  have paid a greater percentage of the aggregate insurance assessment and smaller banks have paid less than they would have 
evans bank has benefited from this provision with its fdic deposit insurance expenses declining from million in to million in this title also increases the minimum reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund from to  but exempts institutions with assets less than billion from the cost of the increase 
the title also permanently increases deposit insurance coverage to  and fully covers non interest bearing transactions accounts through iv

this title also provides that companies with a public market capitalization under million are permanently exempt from the provisions of section b of the sarbanes oxley act sox  which requires that public companies receive an opinion from their external auditors as to the effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting 
under this provision  evans bancorp would be exempt from sox b as it had a public market capitalization of million as of june  the most recent measurement date 
however  the audit committee of the board of directors and the company s management have decided to continue to voluntarily comply with sox b as they believe it is in the best interest of the company 
this title also requires the sec to conduct a study of companies with market capitalization between million and million to determine how the sec could reduce the burden of complying with the internal control audit requirements 

table of contents x 
bureau of consumer financial protection establishes the bureau of consumer financial protection bcfp  an independent entity housed with the federal reserve 
the title gives the bcfp the authority to prohibit practices that it finds to be unfair  deceptive  or abusive in addition to requiring certain disclosures 
an important provision of this title limits interchange fees for debit card transactions to an amount established as reasonable under regulations to be issued by the federal reserve 
cards issued by banks with less than billion in assets are exempt from this requirement 
despite being exempt from this provision  it is possible that the bank may be impacted by this provision if the bank has to match the reduced rates being offered by larger competitors 
this could potentially result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following factors identified by the company s management represent significant potential risks that the company faces in its operations 
the company s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally the united states was in an economic recession from december june  according to the us national bureau of economic research 
while the recession is technically over  economic growth has been muted and the unemployment rate remains high at per the us department of labor as of december  business activity across a wide range of industries and regions has been greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are in serious difficulty due to the high unemployment rate  the lack of consumer spending  and a faltering housing market 
the recession was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to all mortgage and real estate asset classes  to leveraged bank loans and to nearly all asset classes  including equities 
since the end of the recession there has been some recovery in the value of some asset classes  but the economy remains weak with high unemployment  lower property values  and low consumer confidence 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and leases and the value of collateral securing those loans and leases  is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the company operates  in western new york and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  declines in housing and real estate valuations  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
overall  during  the business environment continued to be adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
it is expected that the business environment in western new york  the united states and worldwide will continue to be slow to recover from the recession 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve substantially in the near term 
such conditions could materially adversely affect the credit quality of the company s loans and leases  and therefore  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans expose the company to increased credit risks at december   the company s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled million  or of total loans and leases outstanding  and the company s portfolio of commercial and industrial c i loans totaled million  or of total loans and leases outstanding 
the company plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial loans as they generally earn a higher rate of interest than other loan products offered by the bank 
commercial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of commercial real estate and c i loans often depends on the successful operations and the income stream of the borrowers 
commercial mortgages are collateralized by real property while c i loans are typically secured by business assets such as equipment and accounts receivable 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
also  many of the company s commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or c i loan outstanding with the company 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
commercial real estate loans in non accrual status at december  were million  compared with million at december  c i loans in non accrual status at december  were million  the same as at december  further increases in the delinquency levels of commercial real estate and c i loans could result in an increase in non performing loans and provision for loan and lease losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
continuing concentration of loans in the company s primary market area may increase the company s risk unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  the company provides banking and financial services to customers located primarily in western new york state wny 
therefore  the company s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in wny 
the company s business lending and marketing strategies focus on loans to small and medium sized businesses in this geographic region 
moreover  the company s assets are heavily concentrated in mortgages on properties located in wny 
accordingly  the company s business and operations are 
table of contents vulnerable to downturns in the economy of wny 
the concentration of the company s loans in this geographic region subjects the company to the risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in this region could result in a decrease in loan originations and increases in delinquencies and foreclosures  which would more greatly affect the company than if the company s lending were more geographically diversified 
in addition  the company may suffer losses if there is a decline in the value of properties underlying the company s mortgage loans which would have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
in the event the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses  the company s earnings could decrease the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses in order to capture the probable losses inherent in its loan and lease portfolio 
there is a risk that the company may experience significant loan and lease losses which could exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in determining the amount of the company s recorded allowance  the company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan and lease portfolio  including the creditworthiness of its borrowers  the effect of changes in the local economy on the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans  the effects on the company s loan and lease portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  and the company s loan quality reviews 
our emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and c i loans is a significant factor in evaluating an allowance for loan and lease losses 
as we continue to increase the amount of these loans in our portfolio  additional or increased provisions for loan and lease losses may be necessary and would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review the company s loan and lease portfolio and credit underwriting procedures  as well as its allowance for loan and lease losses  and may require the company to increase its provision for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan and lease charge offs 
at december   the company had a gross loan portfolio of approximately million and the allowance for loan and lease losses was approximately million  which represented of the total amount of gross loans and leases 
if the company s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect or bank regulators require the company to increase its provision for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan and lease charge offs  the company may have to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses or loan and lease charge offs which could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurances that the company s allowance for loan and lease losses will be adequate to protect the company against loan and lease losses that it may incur 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition the company s results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
because the company s interest bearing liabilities generally re price or mature more quickly than its interest earning assets  an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in its net interest income 
changes in interest rates also affect the value of the company s interest earning assets  and in particular  the company s securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
at december   the company s securities available for sale totaled million 
net unrealized gains on securities available for sale  net of tax  amounted to million and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale  therefore  could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity or earnings 
the company also is subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  the company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
in  the frb began a strategy known as operation twist in an effort to further depress long term interest rates 
the frb already owned more than trillion in bonds from previous quantitative easing initiatives 
under operation twist  the frb planned to sell medium term bonds and allow short term bonds to mature and use the proceeds to purchase long term bonds 
the planned effect was to drive up demand for long term bonds and thus push long term interest rates even lower 
there has also been speculation from analysts and the press that the frb may also execute qe  which is a nickname for a third round of quantitative easing  if the economy continues to stagnate 
qe would likely involve the frb purchasing billions of dollars more in bonds in an effort to drive interest rates lower and spark 
table of contents increased economic growth 
easy monetary policy by the frb may increase the interest rate risk for the company by lowering interest rates over the near term  but also by inadvertently causing inflation to rise at a rapid pace once the economy more fully rebounds from the recession 
high inflation rates are usually accompanied by an increase in interest rates 
the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of counterparty relationships 
the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry 
the most important counterparty for the company  in terms of liquidity  is the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny 
the company uses fhlbny as its primary source of overnight funds and also has several long term advances with fhlbny 
at december   the company had a total of million in borrowed funds with fhlbny 
the company has placed sufficient collateral in the form of commercial and residential real estate loans at fhlbny 
as a member of the federal home loan bank system  the bank is required to hold stock in fhlbny 
the bank held fhlbny stock with a fair value of million as of december  the bank s fhlbny stock average yield in was 
there are branches of the fhlb  including new york 
several members have warned that they have either breached risk based capital requirements or that they are close to breaching those requirements 
to conserve capital  some fhlb branches are suspending dividends  cutting dividend payments  and not buying back excess fhlb stock that members hold 
fhlbny has stated that they expect to be able to continue to pay dividends  redeem excess capital stock  and provide competitively priced advances in the future 
the most severe problems in fhlb have been at some of the other fhlb branches 
nonetheless  the fhlb branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
to the extent that one fhlb branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system s debt  other fhlb branches can be called upon to make the payment 
systemic weakness in the fhlb could result in higher costs of fhlb borrowings  reduced value of fhlb stock  and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive  such as brokered time deposits  the discount window at the federal reserve  or lines of credit with correspondent banks first tennessee and m t bank 
strong competition within the company s market area may limit its growth and profitability competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
the company competes with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally within the company s market area and elsewhere 
many of these competitors whether regional or national institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the company does  and may offer certain services that the company does not or cannot provide 
the company s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in this market area 
expansion of the company s branch network may adversely affect its financial results the company has increased its retail branch network from eight branches to thirteen branches by opening de novo branches in five of the last nine years 
in addition  the company plans on opening another branch in  and its strategy is to continue to grow its branch network through de novo branching and acquisitions 
the company cannot assure that its branch expansion strategy will be accretive to earnings or that it will be accretive to earnings within a reasonable period of time 
numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch  such as suitable location  qualified personnel  and an effective marketing strategy 
additionally  it takes time for a new branch to gather sufficient loans and deposits to generate income sufficient to cover its operating expenses 
difficulties the company experiences in implementing its growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations the company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the occ  frb  and by the fdic  as insurer of its deposits 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors 
regulatory requirements affect the company s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank  the imposition of deposit insurance premiums and other assessments  the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan 
table of contents and lease losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  particularly through the new rules and regulations expected to be established by the dodd frank act  could have a material adverse impact on the bank  the company and its business  financial condition and results of operations 
lack of system integrity or credit quality related to funds settlement could result in a financial loss the bank settles funds on behalf of financial institutions  other businesses and consumers and receives funds from clients  card issuers  payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types 
transactions facilitated by the bank include debit card  credit card and electronic bill payment transactions  supporting consumers  financial institutions and other businesses 
these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties and the facilitation of the payment 
if the continuity of operations or integrity of processing were compromised this could result in a financial loss to the bank  and therefore the company  due to a failure in payment facilitation 
in addition  the bank may issue credit to consumers  financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement 
a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to the bank  and therefore to the company 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  the company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports  and other financial information 
the company may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties  or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
while management generally engages only third parties that it knows or believes to be reputable  reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports  or other financial information could cause the company to enter into unfavorable transactions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers the company s business is primarily relationship driven in that many of the company s key employees have extensive customer relationships 
loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor 
while management believes that the company s relationships with its key business producers are good  the company cannot guarantee that all of its key personnel will remain with the organization 
loss of such key personnel  should they enter into an employment relationship with one of the company s competitors  could result in the loss of some of the company s customers 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future fdic insurance premium increases may adversely affect the company s earnings the company is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures or other similar occurrences  the fdic may again increase the premiums assessed upon insured institutions 
such increases and any future increases or required prepayments of fdic insurance premiums may adversely impact the company s results of operations 
the company is a financial holding company and depends on its subsidiaries for dividends  distributions and other payments the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries 
the company s principal source of cash flow  including cash flow to pay dividends to the company s stockholders and principal and interest on its outstanding debt  is dividends from the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the bank  as well as the payment of dividends by the company to its stockholders 
regulations of the occ affect the ability of the bank to pay dividends and other distributions and to make loans to the company 
if the bank is unable to make dividend payments and sufficient capital is not otherwise available  the company may not be able to make dividend payments to its common stockholders or principal and interest payments on its outstanding debt 
because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions  the company faces significant operational risks the company operates in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions 
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including but not 
table of contents limited to  the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and technology  breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements  and business continuation and disaster recovery 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards  adverse business decisions or their implementation  and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
in the event of a breakdown in the internal control system  improper operation of systems or improper employee actions  the company could suffer financial loss  face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption  or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company s customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  and other systems 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption  or security breach of its information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions  or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
if personal  nonpublic  confidential  or proprietary information of customers in the company s possession were to be mishandled or misused  we could suffer significant regulatory consequences  reputational damage  and financial loss 
such mishandling or misuse could include  for example  if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information  either by fault of the company s systems  employees or counterparties  or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions  or security breaches of the company s information systems could damage the company s reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose the company to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the potential for business interruption exists throughout the company s organization integral to the company s performance is the continued efficacy of our technical systems  operational infrastructure  relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in the company s day to day and ongoing operations 
failure by any or all of these resources subjects the company to risks that may vary in size  scale and scope 
this includes  but is not limited to  operational or technical failures  pandemics  ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected  as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly 
although management has established policies and procedures to address such failures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
environmental factors may create liability in the course of its business  the bank has acquired and may acquire in the future  property securing loans that are in default 
there is a risk that the bank could be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties after acquisition by the bank in a foreclosure action  and that the bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage  personal injury and investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with such contamination 
in addition  the owner or former owners of contaminated sites may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from such property 
to date  the bank has not been required to perform any investigation or clean up activities  nor has it been subject to any environmental claims 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will remain the case in the future 
anti takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and state and federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company without approval of the company s board of directors 
under federal law  subject to certain exemptions  a person  entity or group must notify the frb before acquiring control of a bank holding company 
acquisition of or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company  including shares of the company s common stock  creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquiror controls the bank holding company 
also  a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the frb before  among other things  acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank  including the bank 
there also are provisions in the company s certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt 
taken as a whole  these statutory provisions and provisions in the company s certificate of incorporation could result in the company being less attractive to a potential acquiror and thus could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
