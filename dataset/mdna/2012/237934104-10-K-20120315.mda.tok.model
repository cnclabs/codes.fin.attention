item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we provide solutions and services that make data centers more efficient  manageable and responsive to changing business needs 
focused on mid and large size companies  we assess  design  deploy  and support infrastructures such as servers  storage and networks 
we also resell hardware and software from the industry s leading oems as part of our customer offerings 
our portfolio of solutions and services spans four practices consolidation and virtualization  data storage protection  advanced network infrastructures and business continuity and disaster recovery solutions 
we offer a full suite of practice specific consulting  analysis  design  implementation  management  and support services 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as servers  disk arrays  tape systems  networking and interconnection components and software products 
our data center strategy is supported through multiple trends in the market and involves supporting the market and our customers with a single vendor to provide their data center infrastructure needs 
as of december   we have locations  including both leased facilities and home offices  throughout the united states 
we historically have derived our greatest percentage of net sales from customers located in the central part of the united states 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
in about half of the support service contracts that we sell  our customers purchase support services through us  resulting in customers receiving the benefit of integrated system wide support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk that takes calls from customers  diagnoses the issues they are facing and either solves the problem or coordinates with our and or vendor technical staff to meet the customer s needs 
our support service agreements with our customers include an underlying agreement with the product manufacturer 
the manufacturer provides on site support assistance if necessary 
the other half of the support service contracts that we sell to our customers are direct with the product manufacturers 
for all support service contracts we sell  we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
the data center infrastructure solutions and services market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our competition includes other independent storage  server and networking system integrators  high end value added resellers  distributors  consultants and the internal sales force of our suppliers 
our ability to hire and retain qualified outside sales representatives and engineers with enterprise class information storage  server and networking experience is critical to effectively competing in the marketplace and achieving our growth strategies 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data center infrastructure solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions and timing to place orders with us and the size of those orders 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we view the current data center infrastructure market as providing significant opportunity for growth 
currently  our market share is a small part of the overall market 
however  the providers of the data center infrastructure industry s products and technologies are increasing their utilization of indirect sales approaches to broaden their reach and optimize their margins 
increasingly  they are turning to companies such as us to sell their products 
while these trends provide opportunity for us  we must improve our business model to generate sustainable  profitable growth 
our model requires highly skilled sales and technical staff which results in substantial fixed costs for us 
we believe the best way to improve our company and create long term shareholder value is to focus on building scaleable capabilities and a leverageable cost structure 
our current strategies are focused on increasing our sales team productivity 
scaling our existing geographic locations and expanding into new locations 
expanding our customer support revenues 
enhancing our consulting and professional services business 
expanding our managed services portfolios 
to pursue these strategies  we are improving our training  tools and recruiting efforts for sales and technical teams to increase productivity 
investing in customer facing teams to acquire top tier sales and technical talent which we believe will increase our market share in key locations 
deepening our presence in existing enterprise accounts and penetrating new enterprise accounts 
exploring potential acquisitions that we believe can strengthen our resources and capabilities in key geographic locations 
targeting high growth market segments and deploying new technologies which focus on cost saving technologies for our customers 
driving high levels of efficiency by streamlining our supply chain and expanding our professional services tools 
expanding our customer support capabilities and tools based professional services offerings that we believe will provide more value to our customers 
all of these plans have various challenges and risks associated with them  including those described under risk factors in this annual report

reseller business of incentra  llc 
in december  we acquired the reseller business of incentra  llc incentra which designs  procures  implements and supports data center solutions with storage  networking  security and servers from leading manufacturers 
we did not acquire incentra s managed services portfolio and related operations 
we accomplished the acquisition through the purchase of substantially all of the assets of incentra s reseller business pursuant to an asset purchase agreement 
under the asset purchase agreement  we paid incentra million 
we paid million at closing in cash  of which we held back  as security for certain indemnification obligations of incentra

networking solutions division of cross telecom 
in october  we acquired the networking solutions division of minneapolis based cross telecom cross  which qualified as a business combination 
we completed an asset purchase of million  which was paid in cash 
simultaneously  cross entered into a products and services agreement with us to purchase at least million of cisco networking products and services from us over the next three years 
we believe the acquisition of this team of certified cisco networking experts will be additive to our expertise in designing  implementing and managing sophisticated virtualized data center  storage and backup recovery solutions 
in addition  we obtained cross cisco silver certification 
cross has agreed to pay any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount 
the agreement was entered into outside of the acquisition and was assigned no fair value 
we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired to goodwill and finite lived intangibles  which consisted of the services agreement and certifications 
they have estimated lives of four and two years  respectively  and we are amortizing them using the straight line method 
the first and second years of the three year products and services agreement came to an end at september  and  respectively 
per the services agreement any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount would be payable by cross at that time 
at september  and  there was a shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount of  and  respectively 
as discussed above  on october  we determined that the revenue targets would be met and the products and services agreement had no fair value 
therefore  the shortfall amount of  and  for years one and two respectively  represented a change in fair value of the acquisition date products and services agreement and in accordance with asc was classified as other income within operating expenses on our statement of operations 
in october  we entered into an agreement with cross to allow for an early buyout of the third year products and services agreement for which cross paid  this early buyout also represented a change in fair value of the acquisition date and in accordance with asc was classified as other income within operating expenses on our statement of operations 
please see note to our financial statements for further information 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note of the notes to our financial statements describes the significant accounting policies we used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we consider some of these significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
more specifically  critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters at the time of the estimate 
they also require us to consider different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in our estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  which would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot determine estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects with certainty 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates against historical experience and various other assumptions we believe applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates may change as new events occur  as we obtain additional information and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and we have included them in our financial statements as soon as we learned of them 
our management reviews the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we have consistently applied our critical accounting policies throughout our accompanying financial statements 
recent accounting policy change in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards codification asc as summarized in accounting standards update asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu amends industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions to exclude from its scope tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality  or what we refer to as essential software 
we also sell non essential software  which continues to be in the scope of asc asu amends the accounting for multiple element arrangements to provide guidance on how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and eliminates the use of the residual method 
asu also requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of asu and asu for new and materially modified arrangements originating on or after january  the adoption of asu and asu had a material impact on our financial results 
the following table shows total net revenues as reported as a result of the adoption of asu and asu and unaudited total net revenues that would have been reported during the year ended december  had we not adopted asu and asu as reported as if the previous accounting guidance was in effect in thousands total net revenue for the year ended december  the above table represents an increase in total net revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase in total net revenues was due to the recognition of revenue that would have been previously deferred for multiple element arrangements  which include professional services and hardware  software  post contract customer support pcs or other deliverables  where the final undelivered element for which we were unable to establish vender specific objective evidence vsoe as discussed in more detail below of fair value was professional services 
under the previous accounting guidance  since we could only establish vsoe for pcs  all revenue in these multiple element arrangements was deferred until the only remaining undelivered element was pcs 
at that point  revenue was recognized for the delivered elements in an amount based on the residual method of allocation using vsoe for pcs 
the new standard allows for deliverables for which revenue would have been previously deferred to be separated into units of accounting with amounts allocated based on stand alone selling price if the delivered elements have stand alone value 
as a result  revenue is now recognized as each element is delivered  rather than deferred until the only remaining undelivered element is pcs 
for sales prior to  we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a multiple element arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is pcs and or service 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract is recognized as product revenues 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred until the earlier of when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we expect the adoptions of asu and asu to have a material impact on future periods  however we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature and volume of new or materially modified arrangements in any given period 
refer to the change in accounting policy located in footnote basis of presentation  above for more details regarding the change in accounting principle 
results of operations our sales increased million or to million for as compared to our gross profit increased million or to million for as compared to our earnings from operations increased million or to million for as compared to the following table shows  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales

our product sales increased in from up to million and increased in from up to million 
our service sales  which includes customer support  consulting and installation services  increased in over to million and increased in over to million 
our results for both product sale and service sales include revenues of approximately million from the acquisition of midwave 
the increase in our products sales in as compared to  reflect the impact of our midwave acquisition in october  the change in our revenue recognition policy and the increase in product offerings due to our transition to servicing the complete data center 
in addition to storage  our server and network sales have increased as part of our strategy to deliver data center hardware  software and services 
the increase in our products sales in as compared to  reflect the impact of our acquisition of incentra in december  a general increase in it spending in  and the impact of our diversification in the mix of product offerings due to our transition to servicing the complete data center 
our more recent product sales continue to reflect our customers closer scrutiny of expenditures as they focus more attention on the actual or anticipated impact that current economic conditions may have on the growth and profitability of their businesses 
we cannot assure that changes in customer spending or economic conditions will positively impact our future product revenues in our services sales increased in over the increase in services sales included an increase in customer support contract sales of million of over and an increase in installation and configuration services of million or over with the growth in our product sales  we continue to successfully sell our installation and configuration services and customer support contracts 
the increase in our services sales for over included an increase in customer support contract sales of million or over and an increase in installation and configuration services of million or over the increase in service sales in reflects the impact of our acquisition of incentra in december without sustainable growth in our product sales going forward  we expect that our customer support contracts sales may suffer and we cannot assure that our future customer support contract sales will not decline 
we had no single customer account for or greater of either our product or service sales for the years  or gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in  increasing from in and decreasing from in our total gross profit for and includes amortization of intangibles of million and million  respectively  related to order backlog acquired in connection with our midwave acquisition in and our incentra acquisition in these finite lived intangible assets each have an estimated life of three months and one year and were each fully amortized in and  respectively 
product gross profit as a percentage of product sales was in as compared to in and in our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales is impacted by the mix and type of projects we complete for our customers 
our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales for over has improved as our strategy of selling total solutions into the data center has matured 
our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales for over was lower than prior years as we implemented our strategy of selling total solutions into the data center  which includes lower margin servers and networking solutions 
we expect that as we continue implementing our strategy to sell comprehensive data center solutions with servers and networking products that our product gross margins for will be between and 
our product gross profit is also impacted by the various programs we have in place with our vendors that provide economic incentives for achieving various sales performance targets and early payment of invoices 
achieving these targets contributed favorably to our product gross profit by million of product cost of sales  million of product cost of sales and million of product cost of sales in  and  respectively 
these vendor programs constantly change and we negotiate them separately with each vendor 
while we expect the incentive and early pay programs to continue  the vendors could modify or discontinue them  particularly in light of current economic conditions  which would unfavorably impact our product gross profit margins 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales was in as compared to in and in in  our decrease in service gross profit is due to an increase in the sales of products on which we are not able to sell first call support and datalink professional services  which carry lower gross margins 
in  our decrease in service gross profit was in part due to  of incentra related acquisition accounting adjustments to reduce acquired maintenance contracts to fair value 
excluding these adjustments  service gross profit margin would have been for in addition  we have experienced a decrease in the mix of products we can provide first call maintenance support for which generally have higher margins 
we estimate that our service gross margins for will be between and 
operating expenses year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing general and administrative engineering other income integration and transaction costs amortization of intangibles total operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for as compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for over is due to increase in our sales and marketing headcount from the midwave acquisition and higher variable compensation and commissions as related to our increase in sales for the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for over was due to an increase in compensation expenses in connection with our incentra acquisition  which increased our sales and marketing headcount by approximately 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales from to and to  respectively  reflects the improvement in revenues per employee we have realized as part of our growth strategy 
as we continue to selectively hire additional outside sales representatives  our sales and marketing expenses may increase without a commensurate increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for our general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to  but as a percentage of net sales it decreased to from in our general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to  but as a percentage of net sales it decreased to from in the increase in general and administrative expenses for was due to a combination of an increase in bonus variable compensation of  commensurate with the increase in sales and gross margins for and an increase in stock compensation expense of  due to additional grants issued in the increase in general and administrative expenses for was due to increased rent and facility charges of million for the addition of incentra offices we acquired and expenses of  for our national sales meeting 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  in as compared to  reflects the impact of a modest increase in expenses related to the incentra acquisition to support a significant increase in revenues 
general and administrative expenses in included  of severance agreement payments for several of our former executives 
engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our field and customer support engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation and configuration services and with consulting services to our cost of service sales 
engineering expenses increased to million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for over is primarily due to the midwave acquisition  which increased engineering headcount by approximately in the fourth quarter of the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for over is primarily due to an increase in compensation expense in connection with our incentra acquisition  which increased our engineering headcount by approximately 
the decreases in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales  for as compared to  and as compared to  respectively  is primarily a result of a greater percentage of our engineering costs being allocated to our cost of service sales since a greater percentage of our installation and configuration services were performed by our engineering personnel 
other income 
for  and we had other income of million   and  respectively 
our cross acquisition included a reverse earn out agreement  which required cross to purchase at least million of networking products and services from us over three years 
cross agreed to pay any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount 
we believed that we would meet the revenue targets and accordingly  we determined that the reverse earn out had no fair value at the date of this business combination or in any subsequent periods prior to the settlement date 
at september  and  as the first and second years of the three year reverse earn out agreement came to an end  there was a shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase of  and  respectively 
per the services agreement any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount would be payable by cross at that time 
since we had assumed that the revenue targets would be met and the reverse earn out had no fair value  the shortfall amounts of  and  represented a change in fair value of the acquisition date reverse earn out and  in accordance with asc was classified as other income within operation expenses on our statement of operations 
in addition  in october  we entered into an agreement with cross to allow for an early buyout of the third year reverse earn out agreement for which cross paid  this early buyout also represented a change in fair value of the acquisition date and in accordance with asc was classified as other income within operating expenses on our statement of operations 
integration and transaction costs 
we had integration expenses of   and million in  and  respectively 
in  we incurred the majority of these expenses for the acquisition of midwave in october integration and transaction expenses in for the midwave acquisition included audit  legal and other outside consulting fees and expenses for our transition services agreements with former midwave employees 
in and  we incurred the majority of these expenses for the acquisition of the reseller business of incentra in december integration expenses in for the incentra acquisition are related to facility abandonment costs and our transition services agreement which consists of transition benefits  retention bonuses and severances of terminated employees  some of whom assisted with the initial integration of incentra 
integration and transaction expenses in for the incentra acquisition included audit  legal and other outside consulting fees  expenses for our transition services agreement with incentra and severance payments 
intangible amortization 
we had expenses related to the amortization of finite lived intangible assets of million  million and  in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets increased in and from due to the acquisition of midwave  the networking solutions division of cross and the incentra reseller business 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our acquisition of midwave consisted of covenants not to compete  order backlog and customer relationships having estimated lives of years  months and years  respectively 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our acquisition of the networking solutions division of cross consisted of a services agreement and certifications having estimated lives of four years and two years  respectively 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our incentra reseller business acquisition consisted of trademarks  order backlog and customer relationships having estimated lives of three years  one year and eight years  respectively 
our amortization expenses also include the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our mcsi acquisition consisting of customer relationships having an estimated life of six years 
we are amortizing all of these finite lived intangible assets using the straight line method 
we expect amortization expense to be approximately million in we perform an impairment test for finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of such assets 
we recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
we generally measure fair value based on discounted cash flow analyses 
for  and  we identified no triggering events that required us to evaluate the impairment of our long lived assets 
operating earnings years ended december  in thousands earnings loss from operations we realized earnings from operations of million and million in and  respectively 
we realized a loss from operations of  in our earnings from operations in and are a result of our higher revenues and gross margins as we realized the benefits of our midwave and incentra acquisitions and the implementation of our strategy to sell products and services to support the entire data center 
our loss from operations in is a result of a decrease in our revenues and margins due to the current economic downturn and integration and transaction costs we incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of incentra s reseller business

in december  we entered into the amendment to the original lease for the expansion space  which provides us with approximately  total square feet available for our operations 
we will be moving our corporate headquarters to this new location in april under the terms of the amendment  the term of the original lease is extended for months from march  through august  and the term of the lease for the expansion space is for seven years and six months  commencing on march  we have the option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five year term as long as certain conditions are met 
in addition  under the terms of the amendment an allowance of up to  is available from our landlord for costs related to tenant improvements 
if the cost of our tenant improvement is less than the allowance  then we may receive the remaining portion of the allowance  up to a maximum of  as a credit towards our rent payments 
we periodically enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
we would recognize any significant losses implicit in these contracts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   we were not obligated to purchase any goods or services from our suppliers and no such losses existed 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where we use more critical estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
effective january  we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb amended asc as summarized in asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we generally recognize software and hardware revenue upon shipment  installation and configuration services upon completion and customer support contracts ratably over the term of the contract 
please see note for a more detailed description of our revenue recognition policy 
for sales prior to  we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a multiple element arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is pcs and or service 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract is recognized as product revenues 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred until the earlier of when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
inventory valuation 
we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry 
business combinations 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we expect to acquire additional businesses in the future 
in a business combination  we determine the fair value of all acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and all assumed liabilities 
we allocate the fair value of the acquisition to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in amounts equal to the fair value of each asset and liability 
we classify any remaining fair value of the acquisition as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows we expect to generate with the acquired assets 
we amortize certain identifiable  finite life intangible assets  such as service agreements  certifications  trademarks  order backlog and customer relationships  on a straight line basis over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from three months to eight years 
we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets we determine to have indefinite lives 
accordingly  the accounting for acquisitions has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our operating results 
during and  we applied business combination accounting to our acquisitions of midwave  the networking solutions division of cross telecom  and to our acquisition of the incentra reseller business 
see note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information about the application of business combination accounting to these acquisitions 
valuation of goodwill 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we assess the carrying amount of our goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we have only one operating and reporting unit that earns revenues  incurs expenses and makes available discrete financial information for review by our chief operations decision maker 
accordingly  we complete our goodwill impairment testing on this single reporting unit 
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step screens for potential impairment 
if there is an indication of possible impairment  we must complete the second step to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our market capitalization with the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss we record  if any 
we consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
valuation of long lived assets  including finite lived intangibles 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  we perform an impairment test for finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets  such as property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of such assets 
stock based compensation 
we utilize the fair value method of accounting to account for share based compensation awards 
this requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes model to determine the fair value of share based payment awards 
our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables  will affect our determination of fair value 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock grants based upon the closing price of our stock on the grant date 
we base recognition of compensation expense for our performance based  non vested shares on management s estimate of the probable outcome of the performance condition 
management reassesses the probability of meeting these performance conditions on a quarterly basis 
changes in management s estimate of meeting these performance conditions may result in significant fluctuations in compensation expense from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including our expected adoption dates and estimated effects on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot assure you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments
