item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of  and should be read together with  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
unless otherwise specifically noted  all years refer to our fiscal year which ends on june 
table of contents overview we are a leading provider of information solutions and services to the us government 
we derived percent of our revenue during the year ended june  from contracts with us government agencies  including percent from dod customers and percent from us federal civilian agency customers including the department of homeland security 
we also provide services to state and local governments and commercial customers 
for the year ended june   percent of our revenue was from contracts where we were the lead  or prime  contractor 
our contract base has approximately active contracts and  active task orders 
we have a diverse mix of contract types  with percent  percent  and percent of our revenue for the year ended june   derived from cost reimbursable  t m and fixed price contracts  respectively 
we generally do not pursue fixed price software development contracts that may create financial risk 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the following are considered our critical accounting policies revenue recognition contract accounting we generate almost all of our revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts  t m contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for cost plus fee contracts that include performance based fee incentives  and that are subject to the provisions of accounting standards codification asc section  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts asc  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance 
for such cost plus fee contracts subject to the provisions of asc s  revenue recognition sec materials asc s  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
revenue on t m contracts is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered for services provided  to the extent of material cost for products delivered to customers  and to the extent of expenses incurred on behalf of the customers 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customers are recognized as revenue at the time products are delivered to the customers 
we have four basic categories of fixed price contracts fixed unit price  fixed price level of effort  fixed price completion  and fixed price license 
revenue on fixed unit price contracts  where specified units of output under service arrangements are delivered  is recognized as units are delivered based on the specified price per unit 
revenue on fixed unit price maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the service period 
revenue for fixed price level of effort contracts is recognized based upon the number of units of labor actually delivered multiplied by the agreed rate for each unit of labor 
a significant portion of our fixed price completion contracts involve the design and development of complex client systems 
for these contracts that are within the scope of asc  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
for fixed price completion contracts that are not within the scope of asc  revenue is generally recognized ratably over the service period 
our fixed price license agreements and related services contracts are primarily executed in our international operations 
as the agreements to deliver software require significant production  modification or customization of software  revenue is recognized using the contract accounting guidance of asc for agreements to deliver data under license and related services  revenue is recognized as the data is delivered and 
table of contents services are performed 
except for losses on contracts accounted for under asc s  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period such losses are determined 
losses on contracts accounted for under asc s are recognized as the services and materials are provided 
our contracts may include the provision of more than one of our services 
in these situations  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values  with proper consideration given to the guidance provided by other authoritative literature 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenue and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  subcontracting costs  and other direct costs  as well as an allocation of allowable indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees for certain contracts may also be a factor in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
long term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business  and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods are material 
for our federal contracts  we follow us government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts 
due to the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business operations personnel conduct periodic contract status and performance reviews 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenue or costs are required  any significant changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the current period 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business operations personnel performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the dcaa 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents 
we have a formal review process for approving any such work 
revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on previous experiences with the client  communications with the client regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
costs of revenue costs of revenue include all direct contract costs as well as indirect overhead costs and selling  general and administrative expenses that are allowable and allocable to contracts under federal procurement standards 
costs of revenue also include costs and expenses that are unallowable under applicable procurement standards  and thus are not allocable to contracts for billing purposes 
such costs and expenses do not directly generate revenue  but are necessary for business operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts management establishes bad debt reserves against certain billed receivables based upon the latest information available to determine whether invoices are ultimately collectible 
whenever judgment is involved in 
table of contents determining the estimates  there is the potential for bad debt expense and the fair value of accounts receivable to be misstated 
given that we primarily serve the us government and that  in our opinion  we have sufficient controls in place to properly recognize revenue  we believe the risk to be relatively low that a misstatement of accounts receivable would have a material impact on our financial results 
accounts receivable balances are written off when the balance is deemed uncollectible after exhausting all reasonable means of collection 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or if impairment indicators are present 
the evaluation includes comparing the fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit may be impaired 
impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value 
separately identifiable intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators are present 
we have two reporting units domestic operations and international operations 
our reporting units are the same as our operating segments 
approximately percent of our goodwill is attributable to our domestic operations 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using both an income approach and a market approach 
the valuation process considers our estimates of the future operating performance of each reporting unit 
companies in similar industries are researched and analyzed and we consider the domestic and international economic and financial market conditions  both in general and specific to the industry in which we operate  prevailing as of the valuation date 
the income approach utilizes discounted cash flows 
we calculate a weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit in order to estimate the discounted cash flows 
we perform our annual testing for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets as of june of each year 
the fair value of each of our reporting units as of june  exceeded its carrying value 
changes in estimates and assumptions made in the goodwill assessment could effect the estimated fair value of one or both reporting units 
stock based compensation under our stock incentive plan  we issue equity instruments on an annual basis to our directors and key employees 
these instruments may take the form of  among others  shares of restricted stock  restricted stock units rsus  stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars and non qualified stock options nqsos 
we also issue equity instruments in the form of rsus under our management stock purchase plan and director stock purchase plan 
we account for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires that share based payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
we determine the fair value of our nqsos and ssars at the date of grant using option pricing models such as the black scholes or binomial lattice model 
we determine the fair value of our market based and performance based rsus at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock 
stock based compensation cost is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
under the terms of the various equity instrument agreements  vesting of awards may accelerate to varying degrees based on the age of the grantee and the type of equity instrument 
depending on the instrument  vesting may accelerate upon retirement at either age or with the amount of acceleration based on the length of service provided 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue 
consolidated statements of operations years ended june  year to year change to to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars percent dollar amounts in thousands revenue costs of revenue direct costs indirect costs and selling expenses depreciation and amortization total costs of revenue income from operations interest expense and other  net income before income taxes income taxes net income including portion attributable to noncontrolling interest in earnings of joint venture noncontrolling interest in earnings of joint venture net income attributable to caci revenue for fy  our total revenue increased by million  or percent

approximately percent  or million  of revenue growth was organic and resulted primarily from increases in services and solutions provided to our dod  intelligence and federal civilian agency customers 
the remaining percent  or million  of the fy revenue growth was generated by acquisitions completed in fy and fy revenue generated from the date a business is acquired through the first anniversary of that date is considered acquired revenue 
our acquired revenue for fy and fy is as follows in millions business acquired paradigm solutions corporation advanced programs group  inc pangia technologies  llc technigraphics  inc applied systems research  inc systemware incorporated others total

dod revenue includes that earned for services provided to the us army  our largest customer  where our services focus on supporting readiness  tactical military intelligence  and communications systems 
dod revenue also includes work with the us navy  such as services to support the navy s automatic identification technologies and a mine countermeasure program that protects its fleet 
revenue from dod customers increased percent  or million  to billion for fy as compared to fy million of the increase was attributable to acquired dod revenue and the remaining million of the increase was attributable to revenue from existing operations 
revenue from federal civilian agencies increased million  to million during fy as compared to fy of the federal civilian agency revenue growth  million was attributable to acquisitions

revenue from federal civilian agencies increased million  to million during fy as compared to fy of the federal civilian agency revenue growth  million was attributable to acquisitions 
approximately percent of federal civilian agency revenue for the year was derived from doj 
revenue from doj was million in fy versus million in fy commercial and other revenue increased percent  or million  to million in fy as compared to fy this revenue growth came from both acquisitions and a million product sale which was completed in the first quarter of the fiscal year

revenue from state and local governments represented less than one percent of our total revenue in each of fy  fy  and fy our continued focus on dod and federal civilian agency opportunities has resulted in a relatively reduced emphasis on state and local government business 

table of contents income from operations income from operations increased percent or million  in fy as compared to fy our operating margin was percent  up from percent during the same period a year ago 
operating margin was favorably impacted by a changing mix of our direct costs  greater than expected profitability on a large fixed price contract  and the commercial product sale described previously 
income from operations increased percent  or million  in fy as compared to fy our operating margin in fy of percent increased from percent in fy the increase in margin rate related primarily to strong direct labor growth 
during the fiscal years ended june    and  as a percentage of revenue  total direct costs were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the year to year changes in direct costs as a percentage of revenue were driven primarily by a change in the mix of direct labor versus other direct costs odcs  primarily material purchases and subcontracted activities 
odcs are common in our industry and may vary from period to period 
the single largest component of direct costs  direct labor  was million  million and million in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the increase in direct labor during the last three fiscal years is attributable to the organic growth in our federal government business  both in the dod and federal civilian agencies  and to acquisitions 
odcs  which include subcontractor labor and materials along with equipment purchases and travel expenses  were billion  billion  and billion in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
indirect costs and selling expenses include fringe benefits attributable to both direct and indirect labor  marketing and bid and proposal costs  indirect labor and other discretionary costs 
as a percentage of revenue  indirect costs and selling expenses were percent  percent and percent for fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
indirect expense in fy  fy and fy reflected a reduction of expense associated with the reduction in the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions completed in fy the reduction recorded was million in fy  million in fy and million in fy indirect expense in fy also reflected the benefit of higher forfeitures available to offset company contributions under our k plan 
this higher level of forfeitures resulted from an amendment to the k plan during fy that provided that non vested balances are forfeited upon the earlier of a distribution being taken or december of the year the participant terminates employment 
previously  non vested balances were forfeited upon the earlier of a distribution being taken or december following a five year break in service 
a component of indirect costs and selling expenses is stock compensation 
total stock compensation expense was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation expense from fy to fy was due primarily to a higher level of forfeitures in fy and a decrease in stock compensation expense associated with the issuance of performance based rsus in fy and fy the decrease in stock compensation expense from fy to fy was due primarily to a higher level of forfeitures in fy and a further decrease in stock compensation expense associated with the fy and fy performance based rsus 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or percent  in fy as compared to fy the decrease was attributable to decreased amortization of intangible assets offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expense associated with our growing infrastructure 
software amortization on externally marketed software also increased in fy in fy as compared to fy  depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or percent 
the increase was attributable to depreciation and amortization of both tangible and intangible assets  and included an increase in depreciation and leasehold amortization expense associated with a new lease in northern virginia 
these costs were partially offset by a decrease in software amortization on externally marketed software 

table of contents net interest expense and other increased million  or percent in fy  as compared to fy primarily as a result of an increase in interest expense related to higher outstanding debt which was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest expense and other includes a reduction for our share of the net income of ac first  llc  a joint venture between us and aecom government services  inc of million in fy and million in fy net interest expense and other decreased million  or percent  in fy as compared to fy primarily as a result of lower interest rates  lower days sales outstanding  and the prepayment of certain debt outstanding at the beginning of the year

the tax rate in each year benefitted from tax benefits related to deductions claimed for income from qualified domestic production activities and non taxable gains on assets invested in corporate owned life insurance coli policies 
quarterly financial information quarterly financial data for the two most recent fiscal years is provided in note  quarterly financial data  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
effects of inflation during fy  percent of our business was conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which automatically adjust revenue to cover costs that are affected by inflation 
percent of our revenue was earned under t m contracts  where labor rates for many of the services provided are often fixed for several years 
under certain t m contracts containing idiq procurement arrangements  we do adjust labor rates annually as permitted 
the remaining portion of our business is fixed price and may span multiple years 
we generally have been able to price our t m and fixed price contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our positive cash flow from operations and our available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fund our operational needs 
cash flows from operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the credit facility is a million credit facility  which includes a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility  and a million term loan the term loan 
the revolving facility has subfacilities of million for same day swing line borrowings and million for stand by letters of credit 
at june   million was outstanding under the term loan  was outstanding under the revolving facility  we had no borrowings on the swing line and no letters of credit were outstanding 
the credit facility has an accordion feature that will allow the facility to be expanded by an additional million with applicable lender approvals 
the term loan is a five year secured facility under which principal payments are due in quarterly installments of million through september  and million thereafter through september   with the balance due in full on november  the interest rates applicable to loans under the credit facility are floating interest rates that  at our option  equal a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio 
the credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio  a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility also includes customary negative covenants restricting or limiting our ability to guarantee or incur additional indebtedness  grant liens or other security interests to third parties  make loans or investments  transfer 
table of contents assets  declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other distributions  prepay subordinated indebtedness and engage in mergers  acquisitions or other business combinations  in each case except as expressly permitted under the credit facility 
since the inception of the credit facility  we have been in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
a majority of our assets serve as collateral under the credit facility 
effective may   we issued the notes  which mature on may   in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of the notes are subordinate to our senior secured debt  and interest on the notes is payable on may and november of each year 
holders may convert their notes at a conversion rate of shares of caci common stock for each  of note principal an initial conversion price of per share under the following circumstances if the last reported sale price of caci stock is greater than or equal to percent of the conversion price for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five consecutive business day period immediately after any ten consecutive trading day period the note measurement period in which the average of the trading price per  principal amount of convertible note was equal to or less than percent of the average product of the closing price of a share of our common stock and the conversion rate of each date during the note measurement period  upon the occurrence of certain corporate events  as defined  or during the last three month period prior to maturity 
we are required to satisfy percent of the principal amount of these notes solely in cash  with any amounts above the principal amount to be satisfied in common stock 
as of june   none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied 
in the event of a fundamental change  as defined  holders may require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to the principal amount plus any accrued interest 
also  if certain fundamental changes occur prior to maturity  we will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock or  in lieu thereof  we may in certain circumstances elect to adjust the conversion rate and related conversion obligation so that these notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company 
we are not permitted to redeem the notes 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we purchased in a private transaction at a cost of million call options the call options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at a price equal to the conversion price of per share 
the call options allow us to receive shares of our common stock from the counterparties equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would pay the holders of the notes upon conversion 
in addition  we sold warrants the warrants to issue approximately million shares of caci common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the proceeds from the sale of the warrants totaled million 
on a combined basis  the call options and the warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution of caci s common stock in the event that the notes are converted by effectively increasing the conversion price of these notes from to 
the call options and the warrants are separate and legally distinct instruments that bind us and the counterparties and have no binding effect on the holders of the notes 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to cash used for acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock 
working capital was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
our operating cash flow was million for fy  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the current year increase in operating cash flow results from profits earned during the year and differences in our year end cash position 
in the current year  we maintained lower cash balances as more cash was utilized for business acquisitions and share repurchases 
as a result  outstanding checks were required to be classified within accounts payable  increasing operating cash flow by million 
in prior years  when we maintained higher year end cash balances  outstanding checks were recorded as a reduction of our cash balances 
days sales outstanding were at june   compared to for the same period a year ago 

table of contents we used million and million of cash in investing activities during fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in fy was attributed primarily to the acquisitions completed during the year 
purchases of office and computer related equipment of million and million in fy and fy  respectively  accounted for a majority of the remaining funds used in investing activities 
generally  we have relatively low capital expenditure requirements for our business  and expect these expenditures in the coming years to remain consistent with the levels reported in fy cash flows used in financing activities were million during fy and million during fy during fy  we prepaid our then outstanding term loan in connection with entering into the credit facility and used million of cash to repurchase million shares of our company stock 
during fy  we paid million in settlement of contingent consideration for acquisitions that were completed during the year ended june  during the year ended june  we had net borrowings of million under the revolving facility 
these borrowings along with our available cash balance and our operating cash flow funded our repurchase of million shares of company stock for million and our acquisition program 
cash flows from financing activities continued to benefit from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under the caci international inc employee stock purchase plan espp 
proceeds from these activities totaled million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  available bank borrowings  and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on going operations  customary capital expenditures  debt service obligations  and other working capital requirements over the next twelve months 
over the longer term  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations necessary to fulfill the obligations under the credit facility and the notes will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by many factors outside of our control  including current worldwide economic conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we use off balance sheet arrangements to finance the lease of operating facilities 
we have financed the use of all of our current office and warehouse facilities through operating leases 
operating leases are also used to finance the use of computers  servers  phone systems  and to a lesser extent  other fixed assets  such as furnishings  that are obtained in connection with business acquisitions 
we generally assume the lease rights and obligations of companies acquired in business combinations and continue financing equipment under operating leases until the end of the lease term following the acquisition date 
we generally do not finance capital expenditures with operating leases  but instead finance such purchases with available cash balances 
for additional information regarding our operating lease commitments  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
the credit facility provides for stand by letters of credit aggregating up to million that reduce the funds available under the revolving facility when issued 
as of june   we had no outstanding letters of credit 
we have no other material off balance sheet financing arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the interest rates on both the term loan and the revolving facility are affected by changes in market interest rates 
we have the ability to manage these fluctuations in part through interest rate hedging alternatives in the form of interest rate swaps 
we have maintained hedging relationships with various counterparties in recent years  including two interest rate swap agreements that expired in december which allowed us to exchange a portion of our variable rate debt for fixed rate debt 
in april  we entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of million related to a portion of our floating rate indebtedness 
the agreements are effective beginning july  and mature july  all outstanding balances under our term loan  and any amounts that may be borrowed under our revolving facility  are currently subject to interest rate fluctuations 
with every one percent fluctuation in the applicable interest rates  interest expense on our variable rate debt for the year ended june  would have fluctuated by approximately million 
approximately percent and percent of our total revenue in fy and fy  respectively  was derived from our international operations headquartered in the uk our practice in the uk headquartered operation is to negotiate contracts in the same currency in which the predominant expenses are incurred  thereby mitigating the exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
it is not possible to accomplish this in all cases  thus  there is some risk that profits will be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
as of june   we held a combination of euros and pounds sterling in the uk and in the netherlands equivalent to approximately million 
this allows us to better utilize our cash resources on behalf of our foreign subsidiaries  thereby mitigating foreign currency conversion risks
