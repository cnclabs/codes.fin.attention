item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company operates in three business segments 
the overnight air cargo segment  comprised of its mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc csa subsidiaries  operates in the air express delivery services industry 
the ground equipment sales segment  comprised of its global ground support  llc ggs subsidiary  manufactures and provides mobile deicers and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines  airports  the u 
s 
military and industrial customers 
the ground support services segment  comprised of its global aviation services  llc gas subsidiary  provides ground support equipment maintenance and facilities maintenance services to domestic airlines and aviation service providers 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income 
following is a table detailing revenues by segment and by major customer category dollars in thousands year ended march  overnight air cargo segment fedex ground equipment sales segment military commercial domestic commercial international ground support services segment mac and csa are short haul express airfreight carriers and provide overnight air cargo services to one primary customer  fedex corporation fedex 
mac also on occasion provides maintenance services to other airline customers and the u 
s 
military 
under the terms of dry lease service agreements  which currently cover all of the revenue aircraft  the company receives a monthly administrative fee based on the number of aircraft operated and passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
pursuant to such agreements  fedex determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
these agreements are renewable on two to five year terms and may be terminated by fedex at any time upon days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with fedex are standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry 
fedex has been a customer of the company since loss of its contracts with fedex would have a material adverse effect on the company 
mac and csa combined revenues increased by  in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the increase 
ggs manufactures and supports aircraft deicers and other specialized industrial equipment on a worldwide basis 
ggs manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from to  gallons 
ggs also offers fixed pedestal mounted deicers 
each model can be customized as requested by the customer  including single operator configuration  fire suppressant equipment  open basket or enclosed cab design  a patented forced air deicing nozzle and on board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage  color and style of the exterior finish 
ggs also manufactures five models of scissor lift equipment  for catering  cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft  and has developed a line of decontamination equipment  flight line tow tractors  glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment 
ggs competes primarily on the basis of the quality  performance and reliability of its products  prompt delivery  customer service and price 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the usaf 
ggs was awarded two three year extensions of that contract through june on july   the company announced that ggs had been awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the usaf 
the contract award was for one year with four additional one year extension options that may be exercised by the usaf 
in june  the second option period under the contract was exercised  extending the contract to july in september  ggs was awarded a contract to supply flight line tow tractors to the usaf 
the contract award is for one year commencing september  with four additional one year extension options that may be exercised by the usaf 
in september  the first option period under the contract was exercised  extending the contract to september the value of the contract  as well as the number of units to be delivered  will be determined based upon annual requirements and available funding of the usaf 
ggs revenues decreased by  in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the decrease 
gas was formed in september to operate the aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services business of the company 
gas is providing aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services to a wide variety of customers at a number of locations throughout the country 
gas revenues increased by  in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the decrease 
fiscal summary our overnight air cargo segment was again a strong performer in fiscal  as revenues for the segment totaled  for the year ended march   representing a  increase over the prior year 
the segment also saw its operating income increase by  or in fiscal the increase in revenues and operating income is primarily attributable to the addition of four atr aircraft to the mac fleet 
heavy maintenance work was performed on the aircraft in fiscal and completed in fiscal  and all of the aircraft were added onto mac s operating certificate  generating both maintenance revenue as well as additional administrative fee revenue in fiscal revenues for ggs for the year ended march  were down from the prior year  while operating income decreased by  or 
the decrease in ggs operating income is due to a decline in ggs s gross margin percentage  which has continued from the prior year 
gross margin continues to be negatively impacted by a highly competitive environment  including domestic  international and military contracts 
in addition  the segment s production efficiency has been negatively impacted by the reduced air force work in recent years  which previously allowed for more flexibility in delivery and production schedules  which contributed to greater efficiencies and a lower overall cost structure 
during the year ended march   revenues from our gas subsidiary totaled  representing a  increase from the prior year 
the segment also saw its operating income increase by  or in fiscal these are both very positive steps forward for a business segment that suffered a significant business loss in september  as a result of a significant reduction in the scope of work performed for delta  its primary customer 
the services that were reduced  which included the elimination of services at gas s largest delta location  accounted for almost half of gas s historical revenues and a greater proportion of its operating income at the time 
since that time  gas has added new customers and locations to build its revenue base and increase its operating income 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue resulted from a number of offsetting factors 
revenues in the overnight air cargo segment increased  to  largely as a result of increases in administrative fee revenue and maintenance labor revenue relating to the four atr aircraft that were delivered by fedex during fiscal  as well as increases in flight and maintenance operating costs passed through to our customer at cost 
heavy maintenance on the four atr aircraft was completed in fiscal and three of the aircraft were placed into revenue service in fiscal  in addition to the one aircraft that was placed into revenue service during the third quarter of fiscal revenues in the ground equipment sales segment decreased by  to  while the overall decrease in that segment was minimal  there was a swing in the product and customer mix resulting from an increase in deicer sales to the usaf during fiscal  offset by decreased deicer sales in both the commercial domestic and international markets 
a significant factor in the comparative decrease in commercial domestic revenues was the million sale of mobile deicers to the city of charlotte in fiscal revenues in the ground support services segment increased by  to  resulting from an increase in new customers as well as an increase in work and locations for existing customers 
operating expenses on a consolidated basis increased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due to a number of factors 
operating expenses in the overnight air cargo segment were up  corresponding to the increase in revenues within that segment 
ground equipment sales operating costs increased  
ground equipment sales gross margin continues to be negatively impacted by a highly competitive environment  including domestic  international and military contracts 
in addition  the segment s production efficiency has been negatively impacted by relatively low levels of usaf sales compared to prior years 
although sales to the usaf in fiscal were greater than in fiscal  the level of usaf sales was significantly less than in the preceding years 
the higher sales volumes to the usaf previously allowed for more flexibility in our delivery and production schedules  which contributed to greater efficiencies and a lower overall cost structure 
operating expenses in the ground support services segment increased by  relating to the increased revenues produced in fiscal the ground support services segment saw a greater increase in general and administrative expenses related to its revenue growth in fiscal  as discussed in the following paragraph 
general and administrative expense increased  to  in fiscal the company incurred increased general and administration costs in the ground support services segment of  relating to staffing costs  rents and other operating costs  and supply costs associated with new stations and increased business in fiscal in addition  the company experienced increases in other costs including facility rents  staffing  professional fees  and supplies costs 
partially offsetting these increases  profit sharing expense decreased by  directly related to the decreased profit generated by the company in fiscal operating income for the year ended march  was  a  decrease from fiscal the reduction was principally the result of the reduced gross margin and profitability in the ground equipment sales segment as discussed above 
non operating income  net for the year ended march  was  a  decrease from fiscal non operating income is principally interest income  and decreased as a result of decreased rates of return and decreased investment balances in fiscal income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  which included the benefit of current year foreign tax credits and the research and development credit 
income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of which included the benefit of current year foreign tax credits and the research and development credit  as well as the us production deduction 
in addition  the fiscal tax provision included other adjustments for an overstatement of puerto rico tax credits and other accumulated items in prior periods 
net earnings were  or per diluted share for the year ended march   a decrease from earnings of  or per diluted share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company held approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
of this amount  million was invested in liquid money market accounts 
all invested amounts are fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  with the exception of  held in money market accounts 
as of march   the company s working capital amounted to  an increase of  compared to march  the increase resulted principally from the earnings generated from operations  which has been our primary source of liquidity 
the company has a  secured long term revolving credit line with an expiration date of august  the revolving credit line contains customary events of default  a subjective acceleration clause and a fixed charge coverage requirement  with which the company was in compliance at march  the company had no outstanding obligations under its line of credit at march  and see note in the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for further discussion 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its line of credit 
although the line had no outstanding balance at march  and  the line of credit did have a weighted average balance outstanding of approximately  during the year ended march  if the libor interest rate had been increased by one percentage point  based on the weighted average balance outstanding for the year  the change in annual interest expense would have been negligible 
following is a table of changes in cash flow for the respective years ended march  and year ended march  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities was  more for fiscal compared to fiscal the major contributor to this cash flow increase was a decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal  compared to a substantial increase in fiscal  which was partially offset by a cash flow decrease caused by a slight decrease in accounts payable in fiscal compared to a substantial increase in fiscal cash used in investing activities was  higher in fiscal  largely due to the company decreasing its position in short term investments in fiscal the change in investments was solely due to seeking appropriate returns and risk on invested cash 
in addition  capital expenditures increased by  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the company expended approximately  in overhaul costs for its corporate aircraft in fiscal and also expended  for vehicles and tooling for new gas stations in fiscal cash used in financing activities was  less in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a  reduction in dividend paid in fiscal and  proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board 
on may  the company declared a 
per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  off balance sheet arrangements the company defines an off balance sheet arrangement as any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of these arrangements 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs to date have been passed on to its customers 
under the terms of its overnight air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed by its customer 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income 
seasonality ggs s business has historically been seasonal 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce ggs s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing military and international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings throughout the year 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and subsequently was awarded two three year extensions on the contract  which expired in june in july  ggs was awarded a new one year contract with the united states air force with four additional one year extension options 
although sales remain somewhat seasonal  particularly with regard to commercial deicers which typically are delivered prior to the winter season  this diversification has lessened the seasonal impacts in the past when sales under the contract with the united states air force were a significant component of the company s revenues 
if sales to the united states air force cease to be a significant component of ggs s sales  seasonal patterns of revenues and earnings attributable to its commercial deicer business may resume  with revenues and operating income for the segment being lower in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the overnight air cargo and ground support services segments are not susceptible to seasonal trends 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions 
the company s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from estimates 
the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on management s estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined using information such as customer credit history  industry information  credit reports  customer financial condition and the collectability of outstanding accounts receivables 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry  customer credit issues or general economic conditions 
inventories 
the company s parts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are based on assessment of the marketability of slow moving and obsolete inventories 
historical parts usage  current period sales  estimated future demand and anticipated transactions between willing buyers and sellers provide the basis for estimates 
estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced equipment utilization  existing supplies of used inventory available for sale  the retirement of aircraft or ground equipment and changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry 
warranty reserves 
the company warranties its ground equipment products for up to a three year period from date of sale 
product warranty reserves are recorded at time of sale based on the historical average warranty cost and are adjusted as actual warranty cost becomes known 
income taxes 
income taxes have been provided using the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the net affects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
revenue recognition 
cargo revenue is recognized upon completion of contract terms 
maintenance and ground support services revenue is recognized when the service has been performed 
revenue from product sales is recognized when contract terms are completed and ownership has passed to the customer
