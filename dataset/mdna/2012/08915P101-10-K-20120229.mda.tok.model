income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower pre tax income in fiscal compared to fiscal our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared with for fiscal our lower effective tax rate for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected an increased benefit from income tax credits taken in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures and cash dividends 
we fund our liquidity requirements primarily through cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand  future funds from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next months 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
we ended fiscal with million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million in fiscal after reducing our long term debt by million  or  during fiscal  we increased our long term debt by million  or  during fiscal to million from million at the end of fiscal the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years fiscal year dollars in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents the seasonality of our business historically provides greater cash flow from operations during the holiday and winter selling season  with fourth fiscal quarter net sales traditionally generating the strongest profits of our fiscal year 
typically  we use operating cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund inventory increases in anticipation of the holidays and our inventory levels are at their highest in the months leading up to christmas 
as holiday sales significantly reduce inventory levels  this reduction  combined with net income  historically provides us with strong cash flow from operations at the end of our fiscal year 
for fiscal  we strategically increased merchandise inventory levels to add certain new products to stimulate sales and also purchased inventory earlier in the year to mitigate the impact of product cost inflation and potential delivery delays 
reduced inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in lower accounts payable as a percentage of inventory 
also  weaker than anticipated sales during fiscal  particularly in the fourth quarter  resulted in higher inventory levels and reduced operating cash flow for the year  contributing to higher debt balances year over year 
for fiscal  we purchased larger quantities of inventory primarily in anticipation of improving business conditions and as a result of increased availability of certain products 
the higher inventory levels combined with lower than anticipated sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in reduced operating cash flow for the year as compared to the prior year 
for fiscal  our improved earnings contributed to higher cash flow from operations compared to fiscal for fiscal we purchased lower quantities of inventory to reduce our overall inventory levels in anticipation of weaker consumer demand and also reduced our capital spending for new store openings in response to the economic recession 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected higher funding of merchandise inventory along with the timing of inventory purchases and payments  as well as lower net income and accrued expenses and other liabilities  primarily for legal settlements 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected higher inventory levels at the end of fiscal as a result of lower than anticipated fourth quarter holiday sales 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal also reflected higher accounts receivable balances related primarily to landlord tenant allowances for new stores and income tax refunds  along with reduced net income  partially offset by the positive cash flow impact of higher accounts payable related to inventory purchases 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  we received proceeds of million from the sale of owned real property and million as part of a local utility rebate program related to the implementation of a green energy system at our distribution center 
our capital spending is primarily for new store openings  store related remodeling  distribution center and corporate headquarters costs and computer hardware and software purchases 
capital expenditures by category for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows fiscal year dollars in thousands new stores store related remodels distribution center computer hardware  software and other total capital spending in fiscal and reflected the resumption of our new store expansion program 
capital spending levels in fiscal were lower due to substantially fewer new store openings as a result of efforts to conserve capital in response to the economic recession 
our capital expenditures included new stores and two relocations in fiscal  new stores and four relocations in fiscal  and three new stores in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal  and also included amounts related to the implementation of computer system improvements and enhanced security measures to support our infrastructure 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million  and net cash used in financing activities for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility  partially offset by dividend payments and capital lease payments 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility were largely used to fund merchandise inventory purchases 
for fiscal  we used cash provided from operating activities to pay down borrowings from our revolving credit facility  pay dividends and make lease payments 
the lower paydown of borrowings under our revolving credit facility in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflected increased funding of inventory purchases along with the resumption of our new store expansion program in fiscal for fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was used to pay down a significant portion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and we reduced our quarterly dividend payments to per share in order to preserve capital 
as of january   we had revolving credit borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding 
these balances compare to borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding as of january  our revolving credit facility balances have historically increased from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter and from the end of the third quarter to the week of thanksgiving 
the historical increases in our revolving credit facility balances reflect the build up of inventory in anticipation of our summer and winter selling seasons 
revolving credit facility balances typically fall from the week of thanksgiving to the end of the fourth quarter  reflecting inventory sales during the holiday and winter selling season 
the increase in our revolving credit borrowings at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal primarily reflects higher inventory levels  as discussed above  combined with lower accounts payable as a percentage of inventory due in part to the timing of payments 
quarterly dividend payments of per share  for an annual rate of per share  were paid in fiscal and in fiscal  our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of per share of outstanding common stock  for an annual rate of per share 
in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  periodically  we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors 
depending on business conditions  we may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons  including the current market price of our stock  to offset dilution related to equity based compensation plans and to optimize our capital structure 
our board of directors authorized two share repurchase programs for the purchase of million and million of our common stock 
under the authorizations  we may purchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
however  the timing and amount of such purchases  if any  would be at the discretion of management  and would depend upon market conditions and other considerations 
prior to fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock under these programs for million 
in light of the economic climate  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under these programs during fiscal or fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we resumed our share repurchase activity under these programs  repurchasing  shares of our common stock for million 
since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in may through january   we have repurchased a total of  shares for million  leaving a total of million available for share repurchases under our current share repurchase program 
credit agreement 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of other lenders 
initial borrowings under the credit agreement on october  were used to  among other things  repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under our prior financing agreement  at which time the prior financing agreement was terminated 
as further discussed below  the credit agreement was amended on october  the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility the credit facility with an aggregate committed availability of up to million  which amount may be increased at our option up to a maximum of million 
we may also request additional increases in aggregate availability  up to a maximum of million  in which case the existing lenders under the credit agreement will have the option to increase their commitments to accommodate the requested increase 
if such existing lenders do not exercise that option  we may with the consent of wells fargo  not to be unreasonably withheld seek other lenders willing to provide such commitments 
the credit facility includes a million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit and a million sublimit for swingline loans 
all amounts outstanding under the credit facility were originally to mature and become due on october  on october   the credit agreement was amended to extend its maturity date to october  see discussion below 
as of january  and january   our total remaining borrowing availability under the credit agreement  after subtracting letters of credit  was million and million  respectively 
we may borrow under the credit facility from time to time  provided the amounts outstanding will not exceed the lesser of the then aggregate availability as discussed above and the borrowing base such lesser amount being referred to as the loan cap 
the borrowing base generally is comprised of the sum  at the time of calculation of a of our eligible credit card accounts receivable  plus b i during the period of september through december of each year  the cost of our eligible inventory  net of inventory reserves  multiplied by of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible inventory  and ii at all other times  the cost of our eligible inventory  net of inventory reserves  multiplied by of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible inventory  plus c the lesser of i the cost of our eligible in transit inventory  net of inventory reserves  multiplied by of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of our eligible in transit inventory expressed as a percentage of the cost of eligible in transit inventory  or ii million  minus d certain reserves established by wells fargo in its role as the administrative agent in its reasonable discretion 
generally  we may designate specific borrowings under the credit facility as either base rate loans or libo rate loans 
in each case  prior to the amendment dated october  see discussion below  the applicable interest rate was a function of the daily average  over the preceding fiscal quarter  of the excess of the loan cap over amounts outstanding under the credit facility such amount being referred to as the average daily excess availability 
those loans designated as libo rate loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the then applicable libo rate plus an applicable margin as shown in the table below

level average daily excess availability libo rate applicable margin base rate applicable margin i greater than of the loan cap ii less than or equal to of the loan cap obligations under the credit facility are secured by a general lien and perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets 
our credit agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than in certain circumstances  and limit our ability to  among other things  incur liens  incur additional indebtedness  transfer or dispose of assets  change the nature of the business  guarantee obligations  pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase stock  and make advances  loans or investments 
we may declare or pay cash dividends or repurchase stock only if  among other things  no default or event of default then exists or would arise from such dividend or repurchase of stock and  after giving effect to such dividend or repurchase  certain availability and or fixed charge coverage ratio requirements are satisfied 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default  including  without limitation  failure to pay when due principal amounts with respect to the credit facility  failure to pay any interest or other amounts under the credit facility for five days after becoming due  failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants contained in the credit agreement  failure to satisfy certain judgments against us  failure to pay when due or any other default which does or may lead to the acceleration of certain other material indebtedness in principal amount in excess of million  and certain insolvency and bankruptcy events 
on october   we entered into a first amendment to credit agreement and amended certain provisions of our credit agreement 
after the amendment  the applicable interest rate on our borrowings will be a function of the daily average  over the preceding fiscal quarter  of the excess of the credit facility over amounts borrowed such amount being referred to as the average daily excess availability

the following table provides information about our revolving credit borrowings as of and for the periods indicated fiscal year dollars in thousands fiscal year end balance average interest rate maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year future capital requirements 
we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million at january  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding non cash acquisitions  to range from approximately million to million  primarily to fund the opening of new stores  store related remodeling  distribution center equipment and computer hardware and software purchases 
for fiscal  we expect to open approximately ten new stores and relocate approximately seven stores 
of the seven stores expected to be relocated in fiscal  we anticipate closing approximately four stores this year and the remaining three stores in fiscal quarterly dividend payments of per share of outstanding common stock  for an annual rate of per share  were paid in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to per share of outstanding common stock  for an annual rate of per share  which was paid in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  as of february   a total of million remained available for share repurchases under our share repurchase program 
we consider several factors in determining when and if we make share repurchases including  among other things  our alternative cash requirements  existing business conditions and the market price of our stock 
we believe we will be able to fund our cash requirements  for at least the next twelve months  from cash and cash equivalents on hand  operating cash flows and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
however  our ability to satisfy our cash requirements depends upon our future performance  which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks  and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  including factors beyond our control 
there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments  or if we are unable to maintain our ability to borrow sufficient amounts under our credit agreement  we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations  suspend or reduce dividend payments or delay or forego expansion opportunities 
we might not be able to implement successful alternative strategies on satisfactory terms  if at all
