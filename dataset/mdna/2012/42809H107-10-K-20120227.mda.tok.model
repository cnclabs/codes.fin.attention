table of contents item a 
risk factors related to our business and operations our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors  including those described below 
the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  and as a result  holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments 
it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 
our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined petroleum products and electricity  which can be very volatile 
our estimated proved reserves  revenue  operating cash flows  operating margins  future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined petroleum products and electricity  which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control 
changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts 
the major foreign oil producing countries  including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products 
their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets 
the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined petroleum products and electricity 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility  we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price 
in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements  the corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities 
an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 
if we fail to successfully increase our reserves  our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted 
we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time 
replacement of oil and gas production and reserves  including proved undeveloped reserves  is subject to successful exploration drilling  development activities  and enhanced recovery programs 
therefore  future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves 
exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data  which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions  irregularities in pressure or formations  equipment failure  blowouts and weather interruptions 
future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates 
the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns 
reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition 
although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties  similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 
there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow  and actual quantities may be lower than estimated 
numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  capital expenditures  operating expenses  and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues 
in addition  reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance  purchases or sales of properties  results of future development  prevailing oil and gas prices  production sharing contracts  which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase  and other factors 
we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business 
federal  state  local  territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims  disallowance of tax credits and deductions  expropriation or nationalization of property  mandatory government participation  cancellation or amendment of contract rights  and changes in import and export regulations  limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities  as well as other political developments may affect our operations 
the dodd frank wall street reform act  enacted in  delegated rulemaking responsibilities to carry out the act to various us government agencies 
our business could potentially be adversely impacted by one or more of the final 
table of contents rules under this act  when issued  including potential additional costs to engage in certain derivative transactions 
we also market motor fuels through lessee dealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels 
similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states 
as a result of the accident in april at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill  a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico 
while this moratorium has since been lifted  significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed  including an increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil spill 
the new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs 
political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business 
some of the international areas in which we operate  and the partners with whom we operate  are politically less stable than other areas and partners 
political unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may continue to affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally 
the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 
our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities 
our oil and gas operations  like those of the industry  are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills  produced water spills  gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage 
for example  the accident at the bp operated macondo prospect in april resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage 
our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
non compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative  civil or criminal penalties  remedial clean ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities 
in addition  increasingly stringent environmental regulations  particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels  have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 
concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources  particularly using the process of hydraulic fracturing 
while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment  regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost 
for example  a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the corporation s operations in france 
concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products 
we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern 
continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national  regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications  operational changes  taxes  or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations  which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance  operating  maintenance and remediation costs 
in addition  we manufacture petroleum fuels  which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases 
regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of  and revenues from  these products 
finally  to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events  we could experience increased costs related to prevention  maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns 
our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have 
the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive 
we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities  including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas  and in purchasing and marketing of refined petroleum products  natural gas and electricity 
many competitors  including national oil companies  are larger and have substantially greater resources 
we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy 
increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions 
in addition  
table of contents competition for drilling services  technical expertise and equipment has  in the recent past  affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs  resulting in increased capital and operating costs 
catastrophic events  whether naturally occurring or man made  may materially affect our operations and financial conditions 
our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets  interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects 
examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes  fires  explosions and blowouts  such as the accident at the macondo prospect operated by bp in the gulf of mexico in although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses  there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages 
moreover  some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 
item legal proceedings the corporation  along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline  has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline 
a series of similar lawsuits  many involving water utilities or governmental entities  were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe  including the corporation 
the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe 
in  the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled 
in and  additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire 
two separate cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved 
in  a pre tax charge of million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation 
the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages 
the directive  insofar as it affects the corporation  relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark  new jersey now owned by the corporation 
the corporation and over companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination 
the njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river contamination 
in january  these companies added third party defendants  including the corporation  to that case 
in june  the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action  with costs ranging from million to billion for all parties 
based on adverse comments from the corporation and others  the epa is reevaluating its alternatives 
in addition  the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river 
given the ongoing studies  remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time 
based on currently known facts and circumstances  the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments  and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 
on july   the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation  order for corrective action  notice of assessment of civil penalty  notice of opportunity for hearing the novs 
the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st 
croix in may and proposes total penalties of  hovensa is engaging in settlement discussions with the government of the virgin islands  but believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations 
on december   the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced four separate enforcement actions against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation  order for corrective action  notice of assessment of civil penalty  notice of opportunity for hearing 
the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of air release incidents 
table of contents at the hovensa refinery in and and propose total penalties of  hovensa anticipates settling this matter in the first quarter of in july  hess oil virgin islands corp 
hovic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  and hovensa  each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees  advising of the trustee s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery  which had been operated by hovic until october an action was filed on may  in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa  hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st 
croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources 
hovic and hovensa are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint 
the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites 
under this legislation  all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable 
for certain sites  the epa s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed 
with respect to the remaining sites  the epa s claims have been settled  or a proposed settlement is under consideration  in all cases for amounts that are not material 
the ultimate impact of these proceedings  and of any related proceedings by private parties  on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean up cost estimates  but is not expected to be material 
the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings  including proceedings relating to other environmental matters 
the corporation cannot predict with certainty if  how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief  if any  may be  particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages 
numerous issues may need to be resolved  including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding 
subject to the foregoing  in management s opinion  based upon currently known facts and circumstances  the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the corporation

the items in the table below are explained on pages through millions of dollars exploration and production marketing and refining corporate in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report  the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis 
management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings 
management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings  since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount 
after tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts

risk factors related to our business and operations 
accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income 
the accounting methods used can affect net income  equity and various financial statement ratios 
however  the corporation s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 
accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage  including lease bonuses  brokers fees and other related costs  are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  including development dry holes  and related production facilities are capitalized 
in production operations  costs of injected co for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 
table of contents sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project 
if either of those criteria is not met  or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project  the capitalized well costs are charged to expense 
indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel  active negotiations for sales contracts with customers  negotiations with governments  operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 
crude oil and natural gas reserves the sec revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end reporting 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures 
the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities 
the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations  the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment  as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations 
in addition  government and project operator approvals must be obtained and  depending on the amount of the project cost  senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project 
the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties 
the corporation s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells  performance reviews  new technical data and other studies 
to provide consistency throughout the corporation  standard reserve estimation guidelines  definitions  reporting reviews and approval practices are used 
the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review 
the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately of the corporation s total proved reserves 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as explained below  there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing 
the corporation reviews long lived assets  including oil and gas fields  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates  the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded 
the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 
in the case of oil and gas fields  the present value of future net cash flows is based on management s best estimate of future prices  which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices  applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate 
the projected production volumes represent reserves  including probable reserves  expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 
the production volumes  prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information 
oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 
the corporation s impairment tests of long lived e p producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors  selling prices  operating and capital costs  the timing of future production and other factors  which are updated each time an impairment test is performed 
the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease  crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 
the corporation s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level  which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level 
table of contents below an operating segment 
the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors  including the manner in which the business is managed 
the corporation has concluded that the e p segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  since the e p segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level 
accordingly  the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment 
if any of the e p segment components  such as our financial reporting regions united states  europe  africa and asia were considered to be reporting units  an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill asc 
if components are economically similar  that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
while the corporation believes that the e p segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed  it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting asc and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons the corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single  global business 
each component produces oil and gas 
the exploration and production processes are similar in each component 
the methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar 
customers of each component are similar 
the components share technical resources and support services 
if the corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit  goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units 
the corporation s fair value estimate of the e p segment is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments  the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets  and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings  access to new business opportunities  enterprise control  improved processes and increased market share 
the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar e p companies 
the determination of the fair value of the e p segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves  future prices  timing of future net cash flows and market premiums 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the e p segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing  there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the e p segment 
impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred 
the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices  where available  or other valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows 
differences between the carrying value of the corporation s equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliate s fixed assets 
income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not  that based on the technical merits  the position will be sustained upon examination 
the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions  including the united states  and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits 
additionally  the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized 
if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 
in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets  the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards  temporary differences  the availability of tax planning strategies  the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors 
estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation s internal business forecasts 
additionally  the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property  plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group 
the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets 
the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
fair value measurements the corporation s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate 
the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value  including the market and income approaches 
the corporation s fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations 
counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances  and the corporation s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 
the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles 
these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations  the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long lived assets  equity method investments or goodwill 
the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fasb fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input  which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level to estimates determined using related market data level 
multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value  however  the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 
details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded 
closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value 
market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity 
the fair value of certain of the corporation s exchange traded futures and options are considered level fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level measurements based on level inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts 
the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level inputs for certain forwards  swaps and options 
the liability related to the corporation s crude oil hedges is classified as level fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations 
for example  in its energy marketing business  the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts 
the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations  which are classified as level fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities 
in risk management activities  the corporation uses futures  forwards  options and swaps  individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined petroleum 
table of contents products and electricity  as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
in trading activities  the corporation  principally through a consolidated partnership  trades energy related commodities and derivatives  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  based on expectations of future market conditions 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
the corporation s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting 
the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models  which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 
retirement plans the corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan 
the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 
the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  and rate of future increases in compensation levels 
these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation  some of which can be affected by external factors 
for example  the discount rate used to estimate the corporation s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations  while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category  weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation s financial statements 
asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations 
in addition  the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred 
in order to measure these obligations  the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations 
in determining these estimates  the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement  timing of settlement  interpretation of legal requirements  inflationary factors and discount rate 
in addition  there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements  fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology 
as a result  the corporation s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above 
changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

table of contents environment  health and safety the corporation has a values based  socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment  health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business 
the strategy is reflected in the corporation s environment  health  safety and social responsibility ehs sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation s workforce  customers and local communities 
the corporation s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency  adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs sr performance

under the terms of the consent decree  hovensa agreed to pay a penalty of approximately million and spend approximately million over the next years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the hovensa refinery to reduce emissions 
in addition  the consent decree requires hovensa to spend approximately million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the virgin islands and  to assist the virgin islands water and power authority with monitoring
