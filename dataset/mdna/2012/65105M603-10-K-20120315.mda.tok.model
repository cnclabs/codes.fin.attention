item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market considerations 
the coverage tests applicable to our cdo financings may have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows 
we have retained  and may in the future retain or repurchase  subordinate classes of bonds issued by certain of our subsidiaries in our cdo financings 
each of our cdo financings contains tests that measure the amount of over collateralization and excess interest in the transaction 
failure to satisfy these tests would generally result in principal and or interest cash flow that would otherwise be distributed to more junior classes of securities including those held by us to be redirected to pay down the most senior class of securities outstanding until the tests are satisfied 
as a result  failure to satisfy the coverage tests could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows by temporarily or permanently directing funds that would otherwise come to us to holders of the senior classes of bonds 
in addition  the redirected funds would be used to pay down financing  which currently bears an attractive rate  thereby reducing our future earnings from the affected cdo 
the ratings assigned to the assets in each cdo affect the results of the tests governing whether a cdo can distribute cash to the various classes of securities in the cdo 
as a result  ratings downgrades of the assets in a cdo can result in a cdo failing its tests and thereby cause us not to receive cash flows from the affected cdo 
we had approximately million of assets in our consolidated cdos as of december or february  as appropriate  that are under negative watch for possible downgrade by at least one of the rating agencies 
one or more of the rating agencies could downgrade some or all of these assets at any time  and any such downgrade could negatively affect and possibly materially affect our future cash flows 
as of the december remittance date for cdo iv and as of the february remittance date for cdo vi  these cdos were not in compliance with their applicable over collateralization tests and  consequently  we are not receiving residual cash flows from these cdos 
however  we continue to receive senior management fees and cash flow distributions from senior classes of bonds we own 
based upon our current calculations  we expect these cdos to remain out of compliance for the foreseeable future 
moreover  given current market conditions  it is possible that all of our cdos could be out of compliance with their over collateralization tests as of one or more measurement dates within the next twelve months 
our ability to rebalance will depend upon the availability of suitable securities  market prices  whether the reinvestment period of the applicable cdo has ended  and other factors that are beyond our control 
for example  one strategy we have employed to facilitate compliance with over collateralization tests has been to repurchase notes issued by our cdos and subsequently cancel them in accordance with the terms of the relevant governing documentation 
however  there can be no assurance that the trustee of our cdos will not impose guidelines for such cancelations that would make it more difficult or impossible to employ this strategy in the future 
while there are other permissible methods to rebalance or otherwise correct cdo test failures  such methods may be extremely difficult to employ given current market conditions  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our rebalancing efforts 
if the liabilities of our cdos are downgraded by moody s investors service to certain predetermined levels  our discretion to rebalance the applicable cdo portfolios may be negatively impacted 
moreover  if we bring these coverage tests into compliance  we cannot assure you that they will not fall out of compliance in the future or that we will be able to correct any noncompliance 
failure of the over collateralization tests can also cause a phantom income issue if cash that constitutes income is diverted to pay down debt instead of distributed to us 
for more information regarding noncompliance with the terms of certain of our cdo financings in the near future  please see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and debt obligations 
we may experience an event of default or be removed as collateral manager under one or more of our cdos  which would negatively affect us in a number of ways 
the documentation governing our cdos specifies certain events of default  which  if they occur  would negatively affect us 
events of default include  among other things  failure to pay interest on senior classes of securities within the cdo  breaches of covenants  representations or warranties  bankruptcy  and failure to satisfy specific over collateralization and interest coverage tests 
if an event of default occurs under any of our cdos  it could negatively affect our cash flows  business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we can be removed as manager of a cdo if certain events occur  including the failure to satisfy specific over collateralization and interest coverage tests  failure to satisfy certain key man requirements or an event of default occurring for the failure to pay interest on the related senior classes of securities of the cdo 
if we are removed as collateral manager  we would no longer receive management fees from and no longer be able to manage the assets of the applicable cdo  which could negatively affect our cash flows  business  results of operations and financial condition 
on june   cdo v failed additional over collateralization tests 
the consequences of failing these tests are that an event of default has occurred  and we may be removed as the collateral manager under the documentation governing cdo 
table of contents v 
so long as the event of default continues  we will not be permitted to purchase or sell any collateral in cdo v 
if we are removed as the collateral manager of cdo v  we would no longer receive the senior management fees from such cdo 
as of february   we have not been removed as collateral manager 
based upon our current calculations  we estimate that if we are removed as the collateral manager of cdo v  the loss of senior management fees would not have a material negative impact on our cash flows  business  results of operations or financial condition 
given current market conditions  it is possible that events of default may occur in other cdos  and we could be removed as the collateral manager of those cdos if certain events of default occur 
moreover  our cash flows  business  results of operations and or financial condition could be materially and negatively impacted if certain events of default occur 
we have assumed the role of manager of numerous cdos previously managed by a third party  and we may assume the role of manager of additional cdos in the future 
each such engagement exposes us to a number of potential risks 
changes within our industry may result in cdo collateral managers being replaced 
in such instances  we may seek to be engaged as the collateral manager of cdos currently managed by third parties 
for example  in february  one of our subsidiaries became the collateral manager of certain cdos previously managed by c bass investment management llc c bass 
while being engaged as the collateral manager of such cdos potentially enables us to grow our business  it also entails a number of risks that could harm our reputation  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  we purchased the management rights with respect to the c bass cdos pursuant to a bankruptcy proceeding 
as a result  we were not able to conduct extensive due diligence on the cdo assets even though many classes of securities issued by the cdos were rated as distressed by the rating agencies as of the most recent rating date prior to our becoming the collateral manager of the cdos 
we may willingly or unknowingly assume actual or contingent liabilities for significant expenses  we may become subject to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar  and we may become subject to increased risk of litigation  regulatory investigation or negative publicity 
for example  we determined that it would be prudent to register the subsidiary that became the collateral manager of the c bass cdos as a registered investment adviser  which has increased our regulatory compliance costs 
in addition to defending against litigation and complying with regulatory requirements  being engaged as collateral manager may require us to invest other resources for various other reasons  which could detract from our ability to capitalize on future opportunities 
moreover  being engaged as collateral manager may require us to integrate complex technological  accounting and management systems  which may be difficult  expensive and time consuming and which we may not be successful in integrating into our current systems 
in addition to the risk that we face if we are successful in becoming the manager of additional cdos  we may attempt but fail to become the collateral manager of cdos in the future  which could harm our reputation and subject us to costly litigation 
finally  if we include the financial performance of the c bass cdos or other cdos for which we become the collateral manager in our public filings  we are subject to the risk that  particularly during the period immediately after we become the collateral manager  this information may prove to be inaccurate or incomplete 
the occurrence of any of these negative integration events could negatively impact our reputation with both regulators and investors  which could  in turn  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and impair our relationships with the investment community 
the occurrence of any of these problems could negatively affect our reputation  financial condition and results of operations 
our investments have previously been and in the future may be subject to significant impairment charges  which adversely affect our results of operations 
we are required to periodically evaluate our investments for impairment indicators 
the value of an investment is impaired when our analysis indicates that  with respect to a loan  it is probable that we will not be able to collect the full amount we intended to collect from the loan or  with respect to a security  it is probable that the value of the security is other than temporarily impaired 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on a variety of factors depending upon the nature of the investment and the manner in which the income related to such investment was calculated for purposes of our financial statements 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the investment  which could adversely affect our results of operations in the applicable period and thereby adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
as has been widely publicized  the recent market conditions have resulted in a number of financial institutions recording an unprecedented amount of impairment charges  and we were also affected by these conditions 
these challenging conditions have reduced the market trading activity for many real estate securities  resulting in less liquid markets for those securities 
these lower valuations have affected us by  among other things  decreasing our net book value and contributing to our decision to record impairment charges 

table of contents the lenders under our repurchase agreements may elect not to extend financing to us  which could quickly and seriously impair our liquidity 
we have historically financed a meaningful portion of our investments not held in cdos with repurchase agreements  which are short term financing arrangements  and we may enter into additional repurchase agreements in the future 
under the terms of these agreements  we sell a security to a counterparty for a specified price and concurrently agree to repurchase the same security from our counterparty at a later date for a higher specified price 
during the term of the repurchase agreement generally days the counterparty makes funds available to us and holds the security as collateral 
our counterparties can also require us to post additional margin as collateral at any time during the term of the agreement 
when the term of a repurchase agreement ends  we are required to repurchase the security for the specified repurchase price  with the difference between the sale and repurchase prices serving as the equivalent of paying interest to the counterparty in return for extending financing to us 
if we want to continue to finance the security with a repurchase agreement  we ask the counterparty to extend or roll the repurchase agreement for another term 
our counterparties are not required to roll our repurchase agreements upon the expiration of their stated terms  which subjects us to a number of risks 
as we have experienced recently and may experience in the future  counterparties electing to roll our repurchase agreements may charge higher spread and impose more onerous terms upon us  including the requirement that we post additional margin as collateral 
more significantly  if a repurchase agreement counterparty elects not to extend our financing  we would be required to pay the counterparty the full repurchase price on the maturity date and find an alternate source of financing 
alternate sources of financing may be more expensive  contain more onerous terms or simply may not be available 
if we were unable to pay the repurchase price for any security financed with a repurchase agreement  the counterparty has the right to sell the underlying security being held as collateral and require us to compensate for any shortfall between the value of our obligation to the counterparty and the amount for which the collateral was sold which may be a significantly discounted price 
as of december   we had million outstanding under repurchase agreement financings 
moreover  all of our repurchase agreement obligations are with two counterparties 
if any of our counterparties elected not to roll these repurchase agreements  we may not be able to find a replacement counterparty in a timely manner 
our determination of how much leverage to apply to our investments may adversely affect our return on our investments and may reduce cash available for distribution 
we leverage our portfolio through borrowings  generally through the use of credit facilities  warehouse facilities  repurchase agreements  mortgage loans on real estate  securitizations  including the issuance of cdos  private or public offerings of debt by subsidiaries  loans to entities in which we hold  directly or indirectly  interests in pools of properties or loans  and other borrowings 
our investment policies do not limit the amount of leverage we may incur with respect to any specific asset or pool of assets  subject to an overall limit on our use of leverage to as defined in our governing documents of the value of our assets on an aggregate basis 
during the recent financial crisis  the return we were able to earn on our investments and cash available for distribution to our stockholders was significantly reduced due to changes in market conditions causing the cost of our financing to increase relative to the income that can be derived from our assets 
while our liquidity position has improved  we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our improved liquidity position 
we may become party to agreements that require cash payments at periodic intervals 
failure to make such required payments may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently party to repurchase agreements that may require us to post additional margin as collateral at any time during the term of the agreement  based on the value of the collateral 
we may become party to additional financing agreements that require us to make cash payments at periodic intervals or upon the occurrence of certain events 
events could occur or circumstances could arise  which we may not be able to foresee  that may cause us to be unable to make any such cash payments when they become due 
failure to make the payments required under our financing documents would give the lenders the right to require us to repay all amounts owed to them under the applicable financing immediately 
we are subject to counterparty default and concentration risks 
in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into various types of financing arrangements with counterparties 
currently  the majority of our financing arrangements take the form of repurchase agreements  securitization vehicles  loans  hedge contracts  swaps and other derivative and non derivative contracts 
the terms of these contracts are often customized and complex  and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight 
we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults  either voluntarily or involuntarily  on its performance under the contract 
any such default may occur rapidly and without notice to us 
moreover  if a 
table of contents counterparty defaults  we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure  either because we lack the contractual ability or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action 
this inability could occur in times of market stress consistent with the conditions we are currently experiencing  which are precisely the times when defaults may be most likely to occur 
in addition  our risk management processes may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition  and as a result  we may not take sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively 
although we monitor our credit exposures  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect  foresee or evaluate 
in addition  concerns about  or a default by  one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants  which may in turn expose us to significant losses 
in the event of a counterparty default  particularly a default by a major investment bank  we could incur material losses rapidly  and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the event that one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy  our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceeding 
in addition  with respect to our cdos  certain of our derivative counterparties are required to maintain certain ratings to avoid having to post collateral or transfer the derivative to another counterparty 
if a counterparty was downgraded below these levels  it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under the derivative  which could have a material negative effect on the applicable cdo 
furthermore  with respect to our investments in excess msrs  we are subject to the risks of the mortgage servicer 
to the extent that it is terminated as the mortgage servicer of the underlying mortgage loan pool  or files for bankruptcy  our ability to receive excess mortgage servicing fees or eventually recover our investment would be severely impacted 
see we will be dependent on mortgage servicers to service the mortgage loans underlying any mortgage servicing rights that we acquire 
the counterparty risks that we face have increased in complexity and magnitude as a result of the insolvency of a number of major financial institutions such as bear stearns and lehman brothers 
for example  the consolidation and elimination of counterparties has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties 
we are currently party to repurchase agreements with two counterparties 
if any of our counterparties elected not to roll these repurchase agreements  we may not be able to find a replacement counterparty 
in addition  counterparties have generally tightened their underwriting standards and increased their margin requirements for financing  which has negatively impacted us in several ways  including  decreasing the number of counterparties willing to provide financing to us  decreasing the overall amount of leverage available to us  and increasing the costs of borrowing 
we are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of our transactions with a few counterparties 
any loss suffered by us as a result of a counterparty defaulting  refusing to conduct business with us or imposing more onerous terms on us would also negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not match fund certain of our investments  which may increase the risks associated with these investments 
one component of our investment strategy is to use match funded financing structures for our investments  which match assets and liabilities with respect to maturities and interest rates 
when available  this strategy mitigates the risk of not being able to refinance an investment on favorable terms or at all 
however  our manager may elect for us to bear a level of refinancing risk on a short term or longer term basis  as in the case of investments financed with repurchase agreements  when  based on its analysis  our manager determines that bearing such risk is advisable or unavoidable which is generally the case with respect to the residential mortgage loans and fnma fhlmc securities in which we invest 
in addition  we may be unable  as a result of conditions in the credit markets  to match fund our investments 
for example  non recourse term financing not subject to margin requirements was generally not available or economical for the past three years and is currently still difficult to obtain  which impairs our ability to match fund our investments 
moreover  we may not be able to enter into interest rate swaps 
a decision not to  or the inability to  match fund certain investments exposes us to additional risks 
furthermore  we anticipate that  in most cases  for any period during which our floating rate assets are not match funded with respect to maturity  the income from such assets may respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings 
because of this dynamic  interest income from such investments may rise more slowly than the related interest expense  with a consequent decrease in our net income 
interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest expense exceeding interest income would result in operating losses for us from these investments 

table of contents accordingly  if we do not or are unable to match fund our investments with respect to maturities and interest rates  we will be exposed to the risk that we may not be able to finance or refinance our investments on economically favorable terms or may have to liquidate assets at a loss 
we may not be able to finance our investments on a long term basis on attractive terms  including by means of securitization  which may require us to seek more costly financing for our investments or to liquidate assets 
when we acquire securities and loans that we finance on a short term basis with a view to securitization or other long term financing  we bear the risk of being unable to securitize the assets or otherwise finance them on a long term basis at attractive prices or in a timely matter  or at all 
if it is not possible or economical for us to securitize or otherwise finance such assets on a long term basis  we may be unable to pay down our short term credit facilities  or be required to liquidate the assets at a loss in order to do so 
for example  our ability to finance investments with securitizations or other long term non recourse financing not subject to margin requirements has been impaired since as a result of recent market conditions 
these conditions make it highly likely that we will have to use less efficient forms of financing for any new investments  which will likely require a larger portion of our cash flows to be put toward making the initial investment and thereby reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for operations and investments  and which will also likely require us to assume higher levels of risk when financing our investments 
the loans we invest in and the loans underlying the securities we invest in are subject to delinquency  foreclosure and loss  which could result in losses to us 
commercial mortgage loans are secured by multifamily or commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower 
if the net operating income of the property is reduced  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
net operating income of an income producing property can be affected by  among other things tenant mix  success of tenant businesses  property management decisions  property location and condition  competition from comparable types of properties  changes in laws that increase operating expense or limit rents that may be charged  any need to address environmental contamination at the property  the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions and or specific industry segments  declines in regional or local real estate values  declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates  increases in interest rates  changes in the availability of credit on favorable terms  real estate tax rates and other operating expenses  changes in governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  including environmental legislation  acts of god  terrorism  social unrest and civil disturbances 
residential mortgage loans  manufactured housing loans and subprime mortgage loans are secured by single family residential property and are also subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by a residential property is dependent upon the income or assets of the borrower 
a number of factors may impair borrowers abilities to repay their loans  including  among other things  changes in the borrower s employment status  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  changes in interest rates or the availability of credit on favorable terms  changes in regional or local real estate values  changes in regional or local rental rates and changes in real estate taxes 
in the event of default under a loan held directly by us  we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the loan  which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations 
foreclosure of a loan  particularly a commercial loan  can be an expensive and lengthy process  which would negatively affect our anticipated return on the foreclosed loan 
mortgage and asset backed securities are bonds or notes backed by loans and or other financial assets and include commercial mortgage back securities cmbs  fnma fhlmc securities  and real estate related asset backed securities abs 
the ability of a borrower to repay these loans or other financial assets is dependent upon the income or assets of these borrowers 
if a borrower has insufficient income or assets to repay these loans  it will default on its loan 
while we intend to focus on real estate related asset backed securities  there can be no assurance that we will not invest in other types of asset backed securities 
our investments in mortgage and asset backed securities will be adversely affected by defaults under the loans underlying such securities 
to the extent losses are realized on the loans underlying the securities in which we invest  we may not recover the amount invested in  or  in extreme cases  any of our investment in such securities 

table of contents our investments in debt securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities and to the general risks of investing in subordinated real estate securities 
our investments in debt securities involve special risks 
reits generally are required to invest substantially in real estate or real estate related assets and are subject to the inherent risks associated with real estate related investments discussed in this report 
our investments in debt are subject to the risks described above with respect to mortgage loans and mbs and similar risks  including risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss in the event thereof  the dependence upon the successful operation of and net income from real property  risks generally incident to interests in real property  and risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular property 
debt securities may be unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer 
we may also invest in debt securities that are rated below investment grade 
as a result  investments in debt securities are also subject to risks of limited liquidity in the secondary trading market  substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates or credit spreads  subordination to the prior claims of senior lenders to the issuer  the possibility that earnings of the debt security issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service  and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer of such debt securities during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 
these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding debt securities and the ability of the issuers thereof to repay principal and interest 
we invest in excess msrs  and such investments could have a negative impact on our financial results 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit and our exemption from the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  we have purchased and may continue to purchase excess msrs with nationstar  which is a leading residential mortgage servicer that is externally managed by our manager 
we may also purchase excess msrs directly from nationstar or enter into similar transaction with other bank or non bank servicers 
excess msrs are interests in mortgage servicing rights  representing a portion of the fee paid to mortgage servicers 
the fee that a mortgage servicer is entitled to receive for servicing a pool of mortgages generally exceeds the reasonable compensation that would be charged in an arm s length transaction 
for example  government sponsored entities gses  such as the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corp 
fhlmc  generally require mortgage servicers to be paid a minimum servicing fee that significantly exceeds the amount a servicer would charge in an arm s length transaction 
the portion of the fee in excess of what would be charged in an arm s length transaction is commonly referred to as the excess mortgage servicing fee 
we record excess msrs on our balance sheet at fair value  and changes in their fair value are reflected in our consolidated results of operations 
the determination of the fair value of excess msrs requires our management to make numerous estimates and assumptions that could materially differ from actual results 
such estimates and assumptions include  without limitation  estimates of the future cash flows from the excess mortgage servicing fees  which in turn are based upon assumptions about interest rates as well as prepayment rates  delinquencies and foreclosure rates of the underlying mortgage loans 
the ultimate realization of the value of excess msrs  which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  may be materially different than the fair values of such excess msrs as may be reflected in our consolidated statement of financial position as of any particular date 
the use of different estimates or assumptions in connection with the valuation of these assets could produce materially different fair values for such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
accordingly  there may be material uncertainty about the fair value of any excess msrs we acquire 
the values of excess msrs are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
historically  the value of excess msrs has increased when interest rates rise and decreased when interest rates decline due to the effect those changes in interest rates have on prepayment estimates 
we may pursue various hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates 
our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates  the type of assets held and other changing market conditions 
interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us 
to the extent we do not utilize derivatives to hedge against changes in the fair value of excess msrs  our balance sheet  
table of contents results of operations and cash flows would be susceptible to significant volatility due to changes in the fair value of  or cash flows from  excess msrs as interest rates change 
prepayment speeds significantly affect the value of excess msrs 
prepayment speed is the measurement of how quickly borrowers pay down the unpaid principal balance of their loans or how quickly loans are otherwise brought current  modified  liquidated or charged off 
when we purchase excess msrs  we base the price we pay and the rate of amortization of those assets on  among other things  our projection of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans 
our expectation of prepayment speeds is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections 
if prepayment speeds are significantly greater than expected  the carrying value of excess msrs could exceed their estimated fair value 
if the fair value of excess msrs decreases  we would be required to record a non cash charge  which would have a negative impact on our financial results 
furthermore  a significant increase in prepayment speeds could materially reduce the ultimate cash flows we receive from excess msrs  and we could ultimately receive substantially less than what we paid for such assets 
moreover  delinquency rates have a significant impact on the value of excess msrs 
an increase in delinquencies will generally result in lower revenue because typically we will only collect servicing fees from gses or mortgage owners for performing loans 
the price we pay for excess msrs is based on  among other things  our projections of the cash flows from related pools of mortgage loans 
our expectation of delinquencies is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections 
if delinquencies are significantly greater than expected  the estimated fair value of the excess msrs could be diminished 
as a result  we could suffer a loss  which would have a negative impact on our financial results 
furthermore  msrs are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations and may be subject to various judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions on our business 
if the servicer  actually or allegedly failed to comply with applicable laws  rules or regulations  it could be terminated as the servicer  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our ability to acquire excess msrs will be subject to the applicable reit qualification tests  and we may have to hold these interests through taxable reit subsidiaries  which would negatively impact our returns from these assets 
we will be dependent on mortgage servicers to service the mortgage loans underlying any mortgage servicing rights that we acquire 
our investments in msrs or excess msrs are dependent on the mortgage servicer to perform the servicing obligations 
as a result  we could be materially and adversely affected if the servicer is terminated  or is unable to adequately service the underlying mortgage loans due to its failure to comply with applicable laws and regulation  its failure to perform its loss mitigation obligations  a downgrade in its servicer rating  its failure to perform adequately in its external audits  a failure in its operational systems or infrastructure  regulatory scrutiny regarding foreclosure processes lengthening foreclosure timelines  a gse s or a whole loan owner s transfer of servicing to another party  or any other reason 
in addition  a bankruptcy by any mortgage servicer that services the mortgage loans underlying any mortgage servicing rights that we have acquired or may acquire in the future could result in the validity and priority of our ownership in the mortgage servicing rights being challenged in a bankruptcy proceeding  payments made by such servicer to us  or obligations incurred by it  being avoided by a court under federal or state preference laws or federal or state fraudulent conveyance laws  a re characterization of any sale of mortgage servicing rights or other assets to us as a pledge of such assets in a bankruptcy proceeding  or any agreement pursuant to which we purchased the mortgage servicing rights being rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding 
any of the foregoing events could have a material and adverse effect on us 

table of contents gse initiatives and other actions may adversely affect returns from investments in msrs or excess msrs 
on january   the federal housing finance agency announced that it has instructed fnma and fhlmc to study possible alternatives to the current residential mortgage servicing and compensation system used for single family mortgage loans 
it is too early to determine what the gses  including fnma and fhlmc  may propose as alternatives to current servicing compensation practices  or when any such alternatives would become effective 
although we do not expect msrs that have already been created to be subject to any changes implemented by fnma and fhlmc  it is possible that  because of the significant role of fnma and fhlmc in the secondary mortgage market  any changes they implement could become prevalent in the mortgage servicing industry generally 
other industry stakeholders or regulators may also implement or require changes in response to the perception that the current mortgage servicing practices and compensation do not appropriately serve broader housing policy objectives 
these proposals are still evolving 
to the extent the gses implement reforms that materially affect the market for conforming loans  there may be secondary effects on the subprime and alt a markets 
these reforms may have a material adverse effect on the economics or performance of any excess msrs or msrs that we may acquire in the future 
changes to the minimum servicing fee for gse loans could occur at any time and could impact us in significantly negative ways that we are unable to predict or protect against 
currently  when a loan is sold into the secondary market for fnma and fhlmc loans  the servicer is generally required to retain a minimum servicing fee msf of basis points of the outstanding principal balance for fixed rate mortgages 
as has been widely publicized  in september  the federal housing finance agency fhfa announced that a joint initiative on mortgage servicing compensation was seeking public comment on two alternative mortgage servicing compensation structures detailed in a discussion paper 
changes to msf could significantly impact our business in negative ways that we cannot predict or protect against 
for example  a removal of msf could radically change the mortgage servicing industry and could severely limit the excess msrs that will be available for us to invest in 
we cannot predict whether any changes to current msf rules will occur or what impact any changes will have on our business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we are subject to significant competition  and we may not compete successfully 
we are subject to significant competition in seeking investments 
we compete with other companies  including other reits  mortgage servicers  insurance companies and other investors  including funds and companies affiliated with our manager 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we possess or have greater access to capital or various types of financing structures than are available to us  and we may not be able to compete successfully for investments or provide attractive investment returns relative to our competitors 
these competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments or to compromise underwriting standards and  as a result  our origination volume and profit margins could be adversely affected 
furthermore  competition for investments that are suitable for us may lead to the returns available from such investments decreasing  which may further limit our ability to generate our desired returns 
we cannot assure you that other companies will not be formed that compete with us for investments or otherwise pursue investment strategies similar to ours or that we will be able to complete successfully against any such companies 
following the closing of a cdo financing when we have locked in the liability costs for a cdo during the reinvestment period  the rate at which we are able to acquire eligible investments and changes in market conditions may adversely affect our anticipated returns 
during the reinvestment period  we must invest the restricted cash available for reinvestments in our cdos 
until we are able to acquire sufficient assets  our returns will reflect income earned on uninvested cash and  having locked in the cost of liabilities for the particular cdo  the particular cdo s returns will be at risk of declining to the extent that yields on the assets to be acquired decline 
in general  our ability to acquire appropriate investments depends upon the supply in the market of investments we deem suitable  and changes in various economic factors may affect our determination of what constitutes a suitable investment 
our returns will be adversely affected when investments held in cdos are prepaid or sold subsequent to the reinvestment period 
real estate securities and loans are subject to prepayment risk 
in addition  we may sell  and realize gains or losses on  investments 
to the extent such assets were held in cdos subsequent to the end of the reinvestment period  the proceeds are fully utilized to pay down the related cdo s debt 
this causes the leverage on the cdo to decrease  thereby lowering our returns on equity 

table of contents our investments in senior unsecured reit securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular reit issuer and to the general risks of investing in subordinated real estate securities  which may result in losses to us 
our investments in reit securities involve special risks relating to the particular reit issuer of the securities  including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer 
reits generally are required to substantially invest in operating real estate or real estate related assets and are subject to the inherent risks associated with real estate related investments discussed in this report 
our investments in reit securities are also subject to the risks described above with respect to mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities and similar risks  including i risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss in the event thereof  ii the dependence upon the successful operation of and net income from real property  iii risks generally incident to interests in real property  and iv risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular commercial property 
reit securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer 
we may also invest in reit securities that are rated below investment grade 
as a result  investments in reit securities are also subject to risks of i limited liquidity in the secondary trading market  ii substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates  iii subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer  iv the operation of mandatory sinking fund or call redemption provisions during periods of declining interest rates that could cause the issuer to reinvest premature redemption proceeds in lower yielding assets  v the possibility that earnings of the reit issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and dividend obligations and vi the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer of such reit securities during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 
these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding reit securities and the ability of the issuers thereof to repay principal and interest or make dividend payments 
the real estate related loans and other direct and indirect interests in pools of real estate properties or other loans that we invest in may be subject to additional risks relating to the structure and terms of these transactions  which may result in losses to us 
we invest in real estate related loans and other direct and indirect interests in pools of real estate properties or loans such as mezzanine loans and b note mortgage loans 
we invest in mezzanine loans that take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying real property or other business assets or revenue streams or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity owning real property or other business assets or revenue streams or the ownership interest of the parent of such entity 
these types of investments involve a higher degree of risk than long term senior lending secured by business assets or income producing real property because the investment may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by a senior lender 
in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security  we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity  or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to repay our mezzanine loan 
if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan  or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy  our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is repaid in full 
as a result  we may not recover some or all of our investment 
in addition  mezzanine loans may have higher loan to value ratios than conventional mortgage loans  resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 
we also invest in mortgage loans b notes that while secured by a first mortgage on a single large commercial property or group of related properties are subordinated to an a note secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral 
as a result  if an issuer defaults  there may not be sufficient funds remaining for b note holders 
b notes reflect similar credit risks to comparably rated commercial mortgage backed securities 
in addition  we invest  directly or indirectly  in pools of real estate properties or loans 
since each transaction is privately negotiated  these investments can vary in their structural characteristics and risks 
for example  the rights of holders of b notes to control the process following a borrower default may vary from transaction to transaction  while investments in pools of real estate properties or loans may be subject to varying contractual arrangements with third party co investors in such pools 
further  b notes typically are secured by a single property  and so reflect the risks associated with significant concentration 
these investments also are less liquid than commercial mortgage backed securities 
investment in non investment grade loans may involve increased risk of loss 
we have acquired and may continue to acquire in the future certain loans that do not conform to conventional loan criteria applied by traditional lenders and are not rated or are rated as non investment grade for example  for investments rated by moody s investors service  ratings lower than baa  and for standard poor s  bbb or below 
the non investment grade ratings for these loans typically result from the overall leverage of the loans  the lack of a strong operating history for the properties underlying the loans  the borrowers credit history  the properties underlying cash flow or other factors 
as a result  these loans have a higher risk of default and loss than conventional loans 
any loss we incur may reduce 
table of contents distributions to our stockholders 
there are no limits on the percentage of unrated or non investment grade assets we may hold in our portfolio 
insurance on real estate in which we have interests including the real estate serving as collateral for our real estate securities and loans may not cover all losses 
there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes  floods  hurricanes  terrorism or acts of war  that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors  including terrorism or acts of war  also might make the insurance proceeds insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed 
under such circumstances  the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the affected real property 
as a result of the events of september   insurance companies have limited or excluded coverage for acts of terrorism in insurance policies 
as a result  we may suffer losses from acts of terrorism that are not covered by insurance 
in addition  the mortgage loans that are secured by certain of the properties in which we have interests contain customary covenants  including covenants that require property insurance to be maintained in an amount equal to the replacement cost of the properties 
there can be no assurance that the lenders under these mortgage loans will not take the position that exclusions from coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of a covenant which  if uncured  could allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of the mortgage loans 
many of our investments are illiquid  and this lack of liquidity could significantly impede our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions or to realize the value at which such investments are carried if we are required to dispose of them 
the real estate properties that we own and operate and our other direct and indirect investments in real estate and real estate related assets are generally illiquid 
in addition  the real estate securities that we purchase in connection with privately negotiated transactions are not registered under the relevant securities laws  resulting in a prohibition against their transfer  sale  pledge or other disposition except in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of  or is otherwise in accordance with  those laws 
in addition  there are no established trading markets for a majority of our investments 
as a result  our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited 
our securities have historically been valued based primarily on third party quotations  which are subject to significant variability based on the liquidity and price transparency created by market trading activity 
the ongoing dislocation in the trading markets has continued to reduce the trading for many real estate securities  resulting in less transparent prices for those securities 
consequently  it is currently more difficult for us to sell many of our assets than it has been historically because  if we were to sell such assets  we would likely not have access to readily ascertainable market prices when establishing valuations of them 
moreover  currently there is a relatively low market demand for the vast majority of the types of assets that we hold  which may make it extremely difficult to sell our assets 
if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our illiquid investments quickly  we may realize significantly less than the amount at which we have previously valued these investments 
interest rate fluctuations and shifts in the yield curve may cause losses 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our real estate securities  loans  floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates  including changes in expected interest rates or yield curves  affect our business in a number of ways 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities and hedges 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect  among other things  our ability to acquire real estate securities and loans at attractive prices  the value of our real estate securities  loans and derivatives and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in the past  we have utilized hedging transactions to protect our positions from interest rate fluctuations  but as a result of current market conditions we face significant obstacles to entering into new hedging transactions 
as a result  we may not be able to protect new investments from interest rate fluctuations to the same degree as in the past  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  loan and collateral defaults may increase and result in credit losses that would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control 
our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the growth of our investment portfolio  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional capital 
our financing strategy is dependent on our ability to place the match funded debt we use to finance our investments at rates that provide a positive net spread 
if spreads for such liabilities 
table of contents widen or if demand for such liabilities ceases to exist  then our ability to execute future financings will be severely restricted 
interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our real estate securities  real estate related loans and hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
debt obligations are not marked to market 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our fixed rate securities decreases  which will decrease the book value of our equity 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve reflecting an increase in interest rates would also affect the yield required on our real estate securities and therefore their value 
for example  increasing interest rates would reduce the value of the fixed rate assets we hold at the time because the higher yields required by increased interest rates result in lower market prices on existing fixed rate assets in order to adjust the yield upward to meet the market  and vice versa 
this would have similar effects on our real estate securities portfolio and our financial position and operations to a change in interest rates generally 
we may invest in senior living facilities  which are subject to various risks that could have a negative impact on our financial results 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit  we may invest in senior living facilities 
in connection with any such investment  we expect that we would engage a third party possibly an affiliate of our manager to manage the operations of these facilities  for which we would pay a management fee 
the income from any senior living facilities would be dependent on the ability of the managers of such facilities to successfully manage these properties 
the managers would compete with other companies on a number of different levels  including the quality of care provided  reputation  the physical appearance of a facility  price and range of services offered  alternatives for healthcare delivery  the supply of competing properties  physicians  staff  referral sources  location  the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas  and the financial condition of tenants and managers 
a manager s inability to successfully compete with other companies on one or more of the foregoing levels could adversely affect the senior living facility and materially reduce the income we would receive from an investment in such facility 
in addition  private  federal and state payment programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant impact on the profitability of such facilities 
the failure of a manager to comply with any of these laws could result in the loss of accreditation  denial of reimbursement  imposition of fines  suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs  loss of license or closure of the facility 
these events  among others  could result in the loss of part or all of any investment we make in a senior living facility 
furthermore  the ability to successfully manage a senior living facility depends on occupancy levels 
any senior living facility in which we invest may have relatively flat or declining occupancy levels due to falling home prices  declining incomes  stagnant home sales and other economic factors 
in addition  the senior housing segment may continue to experience a decline in occupancy due to the weak economy and the associated decision of certain residents to vacate a facility and instead be cared for at home 
a material decline in occupancy levels and revenues may make it more difficult for the manager of any senior living facility in which we invest to successfully generate income for us 
alternatively  to avoid a decline in occupancy  a manager may reduce the rates charged  which would also reduce our revenues and therefore negatively impact the ability to generate income 
our investments in real estate securities and loans are subject to changes in credit spreads  which could adversely affect our ability to realize gains on the sale of such investments 
real estate securities and loans are subject to changes in credit spreads 
credit spreads measure the yield demanded on securities and loans by the market based on their credit relative to a specific benchmark 
fixed rate securities and loans are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate us treasuries of like maturity 
floating rate securities and loans are valued based on a market credit spread over libor and are affected similarly by changes in libor spreads 
excessive supply of these securities combined with reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on these securities and loans  resulting in the use of a higher  or wider  spread over the benchmark rate to value such securities 
under such conditions  the value of our real estate securities and loan portfolios would tend to decline 
conversely  if the spread used to value such securities were to decrease  or tighten  the value of our real estate securities portfolio would tend to increase 
such changes in the market value of our real estate securities and loan portfolios may affect our net equity  net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  and therefore our ability to realize gains on such securities  or indirectly through their impact on our ability to borrow and access capital 
during through the first quarter of  credit spreads widened substantially 
this widening of credit spreads caused the net unrealized gains on our securities  loans and derivatives  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or retained earnings  and therefore our book value per share  to decrease and resulted in net losses 

table of contents in addition  if the value of our loans subject to financing agreements were to decline  it could affect our ability to refinance such loans upon the maturity of the related repurchase agreements 
any credit or spread related losses incurred with respect to our loans would affect us in the same way as similar losses on our real estate securities portfolio as described above 
any hedging transactions that we enter into may limit our gains or result in losses 
we have used and may continue to use  when feasible and appropriate derivatives to hedge a portion of our interest rate exposure  and this approach has certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the cash available for distribution to stockholders and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
we have adopted a general policy with respect to the use of derivatives  which generally allows us to use derivatives where appropriate  but does not set forth specific policies and procedures or require that we hedge any specific amount of risk 
from time to time  we use derivative instruments  including forwards  futures  swaps and options  in our risk management strategy to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations 
a hedge may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position 
our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of the use of derivatives 
there are limits to the ability of any hedging strategy to protect us completely against interest rate risks 
when rates change  we expect the gain or loss on derivatives to be offset by a related but inverse change in the value of the items  generally our liabilities  that we hedge 
we cannot assure you  however  that our use of derivatives will offset the risks related to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses 
in addition  our hedging strategy may limit our flexibility by causing us to refrain from taking certain actions that would be potentially profitable but would cause adverse consequences under the terms of our hedging arrangements 
the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  limit our ability to hedge 
in managing our hedge instruments  we consider the effect of the expected hedging income on the reit qualification tests that limit the amount of gross income that a reit may receive from hedging 
we need to carefully monitor  and may have to limit  our hedging strategy to assure that we do not realize hedging income  or hold hedges having a value  in excess of the amounts that would cause us to fail the reit gross income and asset tests 
accounting for derivatives under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  is extremely complicated 
any failure by us to account for our derivatives properly in accordance with gaap in our financial statements could adversely affect our earnings 
under certain conditions  increases in prepayment rates can adversely affect yields on many of our investments 
the value of the majority of assets in which we invest may be affected by prepayment rates on these assets 
prepayment rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond our control  and consequently  such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
in periods of declining mortgage interest rates  prepayments on loans generally increase 
if general interest rates decline as well  the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by us in assets yielding less than the yields on the assets that were prepaid 
in addition  the market value of floating rate assets may  because of the risk of prepayment  benefit less than fixed rate assets from declining interest rates 
conversely  in periods of rising interest rates  prepayments on loans generally decrease  in which case we would not have the prepayment proceeds available to invest in assets with higher yields 
under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios we may fail to recoup fully our cost of acquisition of certain investments 
in addition  when market conditions lead us to increase the portion of our cdo investments that are comprised of floating rate securities  the risk of assets inside our cdos prepaying increases 
since our cdo financing costs are locked in  reinvestment of such prepayment proceeds at lower yields than the initial investments  as a result of changes in the interest rate or credit spread environment  will result in a decrease of the return on our equity and therefore our net income 
changes in accounting rules could occur at any time and could impact us in significantly negative ways that we are unable to predict or protect against 
as has been widely publicized  the sec  the financial accounting standards board and other regulatory bodies that establish the accounting rules applicable to us have recently proposed or enacted a wide array of changes to accounting rules 
moreover  in the future these regulators may propose additional changes that we do not currently anticipate 
changes to accounting rules that apply to us could significantly impact our business or our reported financial performance in negative ways that we cannot predict or protect against 
we cannot predict whether any changes to current accounting rules will occur or what impact any codified changes will have on our business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 

table of contents environmental compliance costs and liabilities with respect to real estate in which we have interests may adversely affect our results of operations 
our operating costs may be affected by our obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as the cost of complying with future legislation with respect to the assets  or loans secured by assets  with environmental problems that materially impair the value of the assets 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such property 
such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to remediate properly  may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using such real property as collateral 
certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials  including asbestos containing materials  into the environment  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released asbestos containing materials or other hazardous materials 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which businesses it may be operated  and these restrictions may require expenditures 
in connection with the direct or indirect ownership and operation of properties  we may be potentially liable for any such costs 
the cost of defending against claims of liability or remediating contaminated property and the cost of complying with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
lawsuits  investigations and indemnification claims could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
from time to time  we may be involved in lawsuits or investigations or receive claims for indemnification 
our efforts to resolve any such lawsuits  investigations or claims could be very expensive and highly damaging to our reputation  even if the underlying claims are without merit 
we could potentially be found liable for significant damages or indemnification obligations 
such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to our reit status and other matters our failure to qualify as a reit would result in higher taxes and reduced cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
we operate in a manner intended to qualify us as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets  some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination  and for which we do not obtain independent appraisals 
our compliance with the reit income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis 
moreover  the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes  and the tax treatment of participation interests that we hold in mortgage loans and mezzanine loans  may be uncertain in some circumstances  which could affect the application of the reit qualification requirements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service  or irs  will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers violate the reit requirements 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  and distributions to stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of  and trading prices for  our stock 
unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we initially ceased to qualify as a reit 
our failure to qualify as a reit would create issues under a number of our financings and other agreements and would cause our common and preferred stock to be delisted from the nyse 
our failure to qualify as a reit would create issues under a number of our financing and other agreements 
in addition  the new york stock exchange the nyse requires  as a condition to the continued listing of our common and preferred shares  that we maintain our reit status 
consequently  if we fail to maintain our reit status  our common and preferred shares would promptly be delisted from the nyse  which would decrease the trading activity of such shares 
this could make it difficult to sell shares and could cause the market volume of the shares trading to decline 

table of contents if we were delisted as a result of losing our reit status and desired to relist our shares on the nyse  we would have to reapply to the nyse to be listed as a domestic corporation 
as the nyse s listing standards for reits are less onerous than its standards for domestic corporations  it would be more difficult for us to become a listed company under these heightened standards 
given current conditions  we might not be able to satisfy the nyse s listing standards for a domestic corporation 
as a result  if we were delisted from the nyse  we might not be able to relist as a domestic corporation  in which case our common and preferred shares could not trade on the nyse 
the failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to qualify as real estate assets could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
we may enter into financing arrangements that are structured as sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to which we would nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase these assets at a later date in exchange for a purchase price 
economically  these agreements are financings that are secured by the assets sold pursuant thereto 
we believe that  for purposes of the reit asset and income tests  we should be treated as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such sale and repurchase agreement  notwithstanding that those agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement 
it is possible  however  that the irs could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement  in which case we might fail to qualify as a reit 
dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates 
tax law changes in extended the reduction of the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to individuals from to through dividends payable by reits  however  are generally not eligible for the reduced rates 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits  the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals  trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits  including our common stock 
in addition  the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the newly favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends  which could affect the value of our real estate assets negatively 
reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 
we generally must distribute annually at least of our net taxable income  excluding any net capital gain  in order for corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code 
however  differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short term or long term basis to meet the distribution requirement of the code 
certain of our assets may generate substantial mismatches between taxable income and available cash 
as a result  the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our net taxable income could cause us to i sell assets in adverse market conditions  ii borrow on unfavorable terms or iii distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt  in order to comply with reit requirements 
further  amounts distributed will not be available to fund investment activities 
if we fail to obtain debt or equity capital in the future  it could limit our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
as of december   we had a loss carryforward  inclusive of net operating loss and capital loss  of approximately billion 
the net operating loss carryforward and capital loss carryforward can generally be used to offset future ordinary taxable income and capital gain  for up to twenty years and five years  respectively 
as a result  we do not expect that there will be any reit distribution requirements for the year ending december   except as described below 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses to reduce our future taxable income and related reit distribution requirements may become limited by provisions of the code  thereby jeopardizing our ability to maintain our status as a reit 
in order to maintain our tax status as a reit  we are generally required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and not including net capital gains each year to our stockholders 
to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to reits  we intend to make distributions to our stockholders such that we distribute all or substantially all our net taxable income if any each year  subject to certain adjustments 
however  our ability to meet this distribution requirement and maintain our status as a reit may be adversely affected if certain provisions of the code prevent us from utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses to reduce our taxable income  thereby increasing both our taxable income and the related reit distribution requirement to a level that we are unable to satisfy 
specifically  the code limits the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses to offset taxable income earned in years after the 
table of contents ownership change 
an ownership change occurs if  during a three year testing period  more than of the stock of a company is acquired by one or more persons or certain groups of persons who own  directly or constructively  or more of the stock of such company 
an ownership change can occur as a result of a public offering of stock  as well as through secondary market purchases of our stock and certain types of reorganization transactions 
generally  if an ownership change occurs  the annual limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the company s stock immediately before the ownership change 
if we were to undergo an ownership change as a result of a stock offering or otherwise  depending on the aggregate value of our stock and the level of the applicable federal tax rate at the time of the ownership change  we might be unable to use our net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses to offset our taxable income  and we would therefore be required to distribute larger amounts to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a reit 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy our distribution requirement following an ownership change or otherwise 
if we were to fail to satisfy our distribution requirement  it would cause us to lose our reit status and thereby materially negatively impact our business  financial condition and potentially impair our ability to continue operating in the future 
we may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them 
we may acquire debt instruments in the secondary market for less than their face amount 
the amount of such discount will generally be treated as market discount for federal income tax purposes 
accrued market discount is generally recognized as taxable income over our holding period in the instrument in advance of the receipt of cash 
if we collect less on the debt instrument than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income  we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions 
in addition  we may acquire debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower 
if the amendments to the outstanding debt are significant modifications under the applicable treasury regulations  the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt for debt exchange with the borrower 
in that event  we may be required to recognize taxable gain to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt  even if the value of the debt or the payment expectations have not changed 
following such a taxable modification  we would hold the modified loan with a cost basis equal to its principal amount for federal tax purposes 
moreover  in the event that any debt instruments acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments  or in the event payments with respect to a particular debt instrument are not made when due  we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income 
similarly  we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate mortgage backed securities at the stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received 
the irs tax rules regarding recognizing capital losses and ordinary income for our non recourse financings  coupled with current reit distribution requirements  could result in our recognizing significant taxable net income without receiving an equivalent amount of cash proceeds from which to make required distributions 
this disconnect could have a serious  negative effect on us 
we may experience issues regarding the characterization of income for tax purposes 
for example  we may recognize significant ordinary income  which we would not be able to offset with capital losses  which would  in turn  increase the amount of income we would be required to distribute to shareholders in order to maintain our reit status 
we expect that this disconnect will occur in the case of one or more of our non recourse financing structures  including off balance sheet structures such as our subprime securitizations and non consolidated cdos  where we incur capital losses on the related assets  and ordinary income from the cancellation of the related non recourse financing if the ultimate proceeds from the assets are insufficient to repay such debt 
through december   no such cancellation of cdo debt had been effected as a result of losses incurred 
however  we expect that such cancellation of indebtedness within our cdos  consolidated or non consolidated  may occur in the future 
in the case of our subprime securitizations  million of such cancellations had been effected through december   and we expect such cancellations will continue as losses are realized 
this disconnect could also occur  and has occurred  as a result of the repurchase of our outstanding debt at a discount as the gain recorded upon the cancellation of indebtedness is characterized as ordinary income for tax purposes 
we have repurchased our debt at a discount in the past  and we intend to attempt to do so in the future 
during and  we repurchased million face amount of our outstanding cdo debt and junior subordinated notes at a discount  and recorded million of gain 
in compliance with tax laws  we had the ability to defer the ordinary income recorded as a result of this cancellation of indebtedness to future years and have deferred or intend to defer all or a portion of such gain for and while such deferral may postpone the effect of the disconnect on the ability to offset taxable income and losses  it does not eliminate it 
furthermore  cancellation of indebtedness income recognized on or after january  cannot be deferred and must generally be recognized as ordinary income in the year of such cancellation 
during the year ended 
table of contents december   we repurchased million face amount of our outstanding cdo debt and notes payable at a discount and recorded million of gain for tax purposes of which only million gain relating to million face amount of debt repurchased was recognized for gaap purposes 
the elimination of the ability to defer the recognition of cancellation of indebtedness income introduces additional tax implications that may significantly reduce the economic benefit of repurchasing our outstanding cdo debt 
when we experience any of these disconnects  and to the extent that a distribution through stock dividends is not viable  we may not have sufficient cashflow to make the distributions necessary to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  which would cause us to lose our reit status and thereby materially negatively impact our business  financial condition and potentially impair our ability to continue operating in the future 
under current market conditions  this type of disconnect between taxable income and cash proceeds would be likely to occur at some point in the future if the current regulations that create the disconnect are not revised  but we cannot predict at this time when such a disconnect might occur 
we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from operations to pay our operating expenses and to pay distributions to our stockholders 
as a reit  we are generally required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and not including net capital losses each year to our stockholders 
to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to reits  we intend to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that we distribute all or substantially all of our net taxable income each year  subject to certain adjustments 
however  our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by the risk factors described herein  particularly in light of current market conditions 
in the event of a sustained downturn in our operating results and financial performance relative to previous periods or sustained declines in the value of our asset portfolio  we may be unable to declare or pay quarterly distributions or make distributions to our stockholders  and we may elect to comply with our reit distribution requirements by  after completing various procedural steps  distributing  under certain circumstances  a portion of the required amount in the form of common shares in lieu of cash 
the timing and amount of distributions are in the sole discretion of our board of directors  which considers  among other factors  our earnings  financial condition  debt service obligations and applicable debt covenants  reit qualification requirements and other tax considerations and capital expenditure requirements as our board may deem relevant from time to time 
the stock ownership limit imposed by the internal revenue code for reits and our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and restrict our business combination opportunities 
in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit under the code  not more than in value of our outstanding stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year after our first year 
our charter  with certain exceptions  authorizes our board of directors to take the actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit 
unless exempted by our board of directors  no person may own more than of the aggregate value of our outstanding capital stock  treating classes and series of our stock in the aggregate  or more than of the outstanding shares of our series b preferred stock  series c preferred stock or series d preferred stock 
our board may grant an exemption in its sole discretion  subject to such conditions  representations and undertakings as it may determine in its sole discretion 
these ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our board has granted limited exemptions to an affiliate of our manager  a third party group of funds managed by cohen steers  and certain affiliates of these entities 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes  such as mortgage recording taxes 
moreover  if a reit distributes less than of its taxable income to its stockholders during any calendar year including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year  then it is required to pay an excise tax on of any shortfall between the required and the amount that was actually distributed 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
in addition  in order to meet the reit qualification requirements  or to avert the imposition of a tax that applies to certain gains derived by a reit from dealer property or inventory  we may hold some of our assets through taxable reit subsidiaries 
such subsidiaries will be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the 
table of contents ownership of our stock 
we also may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the existing reit provisions of the code may substantially limit our ability to hedge our operations because a significant amount of the income from those hedging transactions is likely to be treated as non qualifying income for purposes of both reit gross income tests 
in addition  we must limit our aggregate income from non qualified hedging transactions  from our provision of services and from other non qualifying sources  to less than of our annual gross income determined without regard to gross income from qualified hedging transactions 
as a result  we may have to limit our use of certain hedging techniques or implement those hedges through total return swaps 
this could result in greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to incur or could increase the cost of our hedging activities 
if we fail to comply with these limitations  we could lose our reit qualification for federal income tax purposes  unless our failure was due to reasonable cause  and not due to willful neglect  and we meet certain other technical requirements 
even if our failure were due to reasonable cause  we might incur a penalty tax 
the taxable mortgage pool rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur  and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations 
certain of our securitizations have resulted in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for federal income tax purposes 
as a reit  so long as we own of the equity interests in a taxable mortgage pool  we would generally not be adversely affected by the characterization of the securitization as a taxable mortgage pool 
certain categories of stockholders  however  such as foreign stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits  stockholders with net operating losses  and certain tax exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax  could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to the taxable mortgage pool 
in addition  to the extent that our stock is owned by tax exempt disqualified organizations  such as certain government related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income  we could incur a corporate level tax on a portion of our income from the taxable mortgage pool 
in that case  we might reduce the amount of our distributions to any disqualified organization whose stock ownership gave rise to the tax 
maintenance of our investment company act exemption imposes limits on our operations 
we conduct our operations so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act 
we believe that there are a number of exemptions under the investment company act that may be applicable to us 
the assets that we may acquire  therefore  are limited by the provisions of the investment company act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the investment company act 
in addition  we could  among other things  be required either a to change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company or b to register as an investment company  either of which could adversely affect us and the market price for our stock 
the sec recently solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to section c c of the investment company act  including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage reits should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies 
there can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the investment company act status of reits  or sec guidance regarding these exemptions  will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations 
if the sec takes action that could result in our or our subsidiaries failure to maintain an exception or exemption from the investment company act  we could  among other things  be required either to a change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company  b effect sales of our assets in a manner that  or at a time when  we would not otherwise choose to do so  or c register as an investment company which  among other things  would require us to comply with the leverage constraints applicable to investment companies  any of which could negatively affect the value of our common stock  the sustainability of our business model  and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders  which could  in turn  materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our shares 
erisa may restrict investments by plans in our common stock 
a plan fiduciary considering an investment in our common stock should consider  among other things  whether such an investment is consistent with the fiduciary obligations under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended  or erisa  including whether such investment might constitute or give rise to a prohibited transaction under erisa  the code or any substantially similar federal  state or local law and  if so  whether an exemption from such prohibited transaction rules is available 

table of contents maryland takeover statutes may prevent a change of our control  which could depress our stock price 
under maryland law  business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
these business combinations include certain mergers  consolidations  share exchanges  or  in circumstances specified in the statute  an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities or a liquidation or dissolution 
an interested stockholder is defined as any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of the corporation s outstanding shares  or an affiliate or associate of a corporation who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation 
a person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder 
after the five year prohibition  any business combination between the maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation voting together as a single group  and two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder voting together as a single voting group 
the business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer  including potential acquisitions that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our authorized  but unissued common and preferred stock may prevent a change in our control 
our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock 
in addition  our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences  rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares 
as a result  our board may establish a series of preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our stockholder rights plan could inhibit a change in our control 
we have adopted a stockholder rights agreement 
under the terms of the rights agreement  in general  if a person or group acquires more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  all of our other common stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a discount to such securities fair market value  thus causing substantial dilution to the acquiring person 
the rights agreement may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control not approved by our board of directors and  therefore  could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with such a transaction 
in addition  since our board of directors can prevent the rights agreement from operating  in the event our board approves of an acquiring person  the rights agreement gives our board of directors significant discretion over whether a potential acquirer s efforts to acquire a large interest in us will be successful 
because the rights agreement contains provisions that are designed to ensure that the executive officers  our manager and its affiliates will never  alone  be considered a group that is an acquiring person  the rights agreement provides the executive officers  our manager and its affiliates with certain advantages that are not available to other stockholders 
our staggered board and other provisions of our charter and bylaws may prevent a change in our control 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors of each class are chosen for three year terms upon the expiration of their current terms  and each year one class of directors is elected by the stockholders 
the staggered terms of our directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt at a change in control  even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
in addition  our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 

table of contents risks related to our common shares our share price has fluctuated meaningfully  particularly on a percentage basis  and may fluctuate meaningfully in the future 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them 
the trading price of our common shares has fluctuated significantly over the last three years 
moreover  future share price fluctuations could likely be subject to similarly wide price fluctuations in the future in response to various factors  including market conditions in the broader stock market in general  or in the reit or real estate industry in particular  our ability to make investments with attractive risk adjusted returns  including  without limitation  investments in excess msrs or senior living facilities  market perception of our current and projected financial condition  potential growth  future earnings and future cash dividends  announcements we make regarding dividends  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  market perception or media coverage of our manager or its affiliates  actions by rating agencies  short sales of our common stock  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  media coverage of us  other reits or the outlook of the real estate industry  major reductions in trading volumes on the exchanges on which we operate  credit deterioration within our portfolio  legislative or regulatory developments  including changes in the status of our regulatory approvals or licenses  and litigation and governmental investigations 
these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common shares to fluctuate substantially  which may negatively affect the price or liquidity of our common shares 
moreover  the recent market conditions negatively impacted our share price and may do so in the future 
when the market price of a stock has been volatile or has decreased significantly in the past  holders of that stock have  at times  instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our shareholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending  settling or paying any resulting judgments related to the lawsuit 
such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business and hurt our share price 
we may be unable or elect not to pay dividends on our common or preferred shares in the future  which would negatively impact our business in a number of ways and decrease the price of our common and preferred shares 
while we are required to make distributions in order to maintain our reit status as described above under we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from operations to pay our operating expenses and to pay distributions to our stockholders  we may elect not to maintain our reit status  in which case we would no longer be required to make such distributions 
moreover  even if we do elect to maintain our reit status  we may elect to comply with the applicable requirements by  after completing various procedural steps  distributing  under certain circumstances  a portion of the required amount in the form of shares of our common stock in lieu of cash 
if we elect not to maintain our reit status or to satisfy any required distributions in common shares in lieu of cash  such action could negatively affect our business and financial condition as well as the price of both our common and preferred shares 
no assurance can be given that we will pay any dividends on our common shares in the future 
we do not currently have unpaid accrued dividends on our preferred shares 
however  to the extent we do  we cannot pay any dividends on our common shares  pay any consideration to repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or redeem any shares of any series of our preferred stock without redeeming all of our outstanding preferred shares in accordance with the governing documentation 
consequently  the failure to pay dividends on our preferred shares restricts the actions that we may take with respect to our common shares and preferred shares 
moreover  if we do not pay dividends on any series of preferred stock for six or more periods  then holders of each affected series obtain the right to call a special meeting and elect two members to our board of directors 
we cannot predict whether the holders of our preferred stock would take such action or  if taken  how long the process would take or what impact the two new directors on our board of directors would have on our company other than increasing our director compensation costs 
however  the election of additional directors would affect the composition of our board of directors and  thus  could affect the management of our business 

table of contents we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock  in which case you could be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive 
we may in the future distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder 
taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received 
if a us stockholder sells the stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax  the sale proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend  depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale 
furthermore  with respect to certain non us stockholders  we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends  including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock 
in addition  if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends  it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock 
it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to pay taxable dividends in cash and stock 
moreover  various aspects of such a taxable cash stock dividend are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the irs 
no assurance can be given that the irs will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash stock dividends  including on a retroactive basis  or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash stock dividends have not been met 
shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect our common stock price 
sales of our common stock or other securities in the public or private market  or the perception that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
this could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities 
under our certificate of incorporation  we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock  of which  shares of common stock were outstanding as of december  we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or other securities or the effect  if any  that future sales and issuances would have on the market price of our common stock 
an increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
one of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price relative to market interest rates 
if the market price of our common stock is based primarily on the earnings and return that we derive from our investments and income with respect to our investments and our related distributions to stockholders  and not from the market value of the investments themselves  then interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions will likely affect the market price of our common stock 
for instance  if market interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate  the market price of our common stock could decrease as potential investors may require a higher distribution yield on our common stock or seek other securities paying higher distributions or interest 
in addition  rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our variable rate debt  thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay distributions
