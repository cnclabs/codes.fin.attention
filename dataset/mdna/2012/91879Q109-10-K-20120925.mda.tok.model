item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes related thereto included in this form k 
to the extent that the following management s discussion and analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a  risk factors in this form k 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements section and item a  risk factors each included in this form k 
management s discussion and analysis includes discussion of financial performance within each of our segments 
we have chosen to specifically include reported ebitda defined as segment net revenue less segment operating expense  plus or minus segment equity investment income or loss and for the real estate segment  plus gain on sale of real property and net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents  in the following discussion because we consider these measurements to be significant indications of our financial performance and available capital resources 
reported ebitda and net debt are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
we utilize reported ebitda in evaluating our performance and in allocating resources to our segments 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of reported ebitda to net income attributable to vail resorts  inc we also believe that net debt is an important measurement as it is an indicator of our ability to obtain additional capital resources for our future cash needs 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of net debt 
items excluded from reported ebitda and net debt are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance or liquidity 
reported ebitda and net debt should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or substitute for  net income  net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because reported ebitda and net debt are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations  reported ebitda and net debt as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
overview our operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate 
resort is the combination of the mountain and lodging segments 
revenue from the mountain  lodging and real estate segments represented  and  respectively  of our net revenue for fiscal mountain segment the mountain segment is comprised of the operations of seven ski resort properties at the vail  breckenridge  keystone and beaver creek mountain resorts in colorado colorado resorts and the heavenly  northstar and kirkwood acquired on april  mountain resorts in the lake tahoe area of california and nevada tahoe resorts as well as ancillary services  primarily including ski school  dining and retail rental operations 
our seven ski resorts were open for business for the ski season primarily from mid november through mid april  which is the peak operating season for the mountain segment 
our single largest source of mountain segment revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately  and of mountain segment net revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
lift ticket revenue is driven by volume and pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories i out of state and international destination guests and ii in state and local in state guests 
for the and the ski seasons  destination guests comprised approximately of our skier visits  while in state guests comprised approximately of our skier visits  which compares to approximately and  respectively  for the ski season 
destination guests generally purchase our higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services such as ski school  dining and retail rental  as well as lodging at or around our resorts 
destination guest visitation is less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather  but can be more impacted by adverse economic conditions or the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more value oriented and weather sensitive 
we offer a variety of season pass products for all of our ski resorts  marketed towards both destination and in state guests 
our season pass product offerings range from providing access to a combination of our resorts to our epic season pass that allows pass holders unlimited and unrestricted access to all of our ski resorts 
our season pass products provide a value option to our guests  which in turn assists us in developing a loyal base of customers who commit to ski at our resorts generally in advance of the ski season and typically ski more days each season at our resorts than those guests who do not buy season passes 
as such  our season pass program drives strong customer loyalty  mitigates exposure to many weather sensitive guests  and generates additional ancillary spending 
in addition  our season pass products attract new guests to our resorts 
all of our season pass products  including the epic season pass  are sold predominately prior to the start of the ski season 
season pass revenue  although primarily collected prior to the ski season  is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations ratably over the ski season 
for the  and ski seasons approximately  and  respectively  of total lift ticket revenue recognized was comprised of season pass revenue 
the cost structure of our ski resort operations has a significant fixed component with variable expenses including  but not limited to  forest service fees  credit card fees  retail rental cost of sales and labor  ski school labor and dining operations  as such  profit margins can fluctuate greatly based on the level of revenues 
lodging segment operations within the lodging segment include i ownership management of a group of luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  the majority of which are proximate to our ski resorts  ii ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to our ski resorts  iii nps concessionaire properties including gtlc  iv cme  a resort ground transportation company  and v golf courses 
the performance of lodging properties including managed condominium rooms proximate to our ski resorts  and cme  is closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment and generally experiences similar seasonal trends  particularly with respect to visitation by destination guests  and represented approximately  and of lodging segment net revenue excluding lodging segment revenue associated with reimbursement of payroll costs for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
management primarily focuses on lodging net revenue excluding payroll cost reimbursement and lodging operating expense excluding reimbursed payroll costs which are not measures of financial performance under gaap as the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  as such the revenue and corresponding expense have no effect on our lodging reported ebitda which we use to evaluate lodging segment performance 
revenue of the lodging segment during our first and fourth fiscal quarters is generated primarily by the operations of our nps concessionaire properties as their operating season generally occurs from mid may to mid october  golf operations and seasonally low operations from our other owned and managed properties and businesses 
real estate segment the real estate segment owns and develops real estate in and around our resort communities and primarily engages in vertical development of projects 
currently  the principal activities of our real estate segment include the marketing and selling of remaining condominium units that are available for sale  planning for future real estate development projects  including zoning and acquisition of applicable permits and the purchase of selected strategic land parcels for future development 
revenue from vertical development projects is not recognized until closing of individual units within a project  which occurs after substantial completion of the project 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of vertical development by often utilizing guaranteed maximum price construction contracts although certain construction costs may not be covered by contractual limitations  pre selling a portion of the project  requiring significant non refundable deposits  and potentially obtaining non recourse financing for certain projects although our last two major vertical development projects have not incurred any such direct third party financing 
additionally  our real estate development projects most often result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the mountain and lodging segments 
our revenue from the real estate segment  and associated expense  can fluctuate significantly based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold  causing volatility in the real estate segment s operating results from period to period 
recent trends  risks and uncertainties the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified in item a and elsewhere in this form k 
we have identified the following important factors as well as uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact our future financial performance the timing and amount of snowfall can have an impact on mountain and lodging revenue particularly in regards to skier visits and the duration and frequency of guest visitation 
to help mitigate this impact  we sell a variety of season pass products prior to the beginning of the ski season resulting in a more stabilized stream of lift revenue 
additionally  our season pass products provide a value option to our guests  which in turn creates a guest commitment predominantly prior to the start of the ski season 
in march  we began our pre season pass sales program for the ski season 
through september   our pre season pass sales for the upcoming ski season including kirkwood for both the current and prior year  which prior year includes pass sales that occurred before our acquisition of kirkwood have increased approximately in units and increased approximately in sales dollars  compared to the prior year period ended september  we cannot predict if this favorable trend will continue through the fall pass sales campaign  nor can we predict the overall impact that season pass sales will have on lift ticket revenue for the ski season 
in fiscal there was unprecedented low snowfall conditions throughout the ski season across the united states that resulted in a reduction of approximately million  or  visits industry wide and a decline in our total visitation as compared to the prior year which had record snowfall 
despite the decline in visitation our lift revenue and ancillary services revenue did not decline at those levels given the strength of our operating model  including the high proportion of season pass sales  the demographic mix of our guests  and the quality of our mountain resorts  including significant snowmaking capabilities 
there can be no certainty that snowfall levels will return to historical averages for the ski season or the impact to advance bookings  guest travel  season pass sales  lift ticket revenue excluding season passes  retail rental sales or other ancillary services revenue next season as a result of last season s low snowfall or if snowfall levels do not return to their historical average levels 
weak economic conditions currently present or recently present in the united states  europe and parts of the rest of the world including high unemployment  erosion of consumer confidence  sovereign debt issues  and financial instability in the global markets  may potentially have negative effects on the travel and leisure industry and on our results of operations 
given the current uncertainties around global economic trends  we cannot predict what impact this will have on overall travel and leisure or more specifically  on our guest visitation  guest spending or other related trends for the upcoming ski season 
in fiscal  our lift ticket revenue was favorably impacted by price increases that were implemented during the ski season which was offset by lower skier visitation excluding season pass holders which we believe was a result of historically low snowfall 
prices for the ski season have not yet been finalized  and as such  there can be no assurances as to the level of price increases  if any  which will occur and the impact that pricing may have on visitation or revenue 
in july  we announced our new comprehensive summer activities plan for epic discovery  a summer mountain adventure at vail mountain 
the plan includes a number of new activities  including among other activities  zip lines  ropes courses  mountain excursions and forest flyers 
the construction of the new activities and amenities at vail mountain will be implemented in two phases based upon permitting and approvals 
we anticipate investing approximately million in resort capital expenditures for both phases 
similar sized plans are being finalized for breckenridge and heavenly with smaller scale improvements planned for our other resorts 
we anticipate that if our proposed plans are approved and implemented  and once these summer activities mature  we could realize substantial incremental summer guest visitation and revenue 
however  our new summer activities plan may not generate the initial projected revenue and profit margins we expect  and even if our plans are successful  we do not expect that these enhanced summer operations will fully mitigate the seasonal losses that our mountain operations experience from late spring to late fall 
real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on condominium units available for sale  which determines when revenue and associated cost of sales is recognized 
changes to the anticipated timing or mix of closing on one or more real estate projects  or unit closings within a real estate project  could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
we currently have units at the ritz carlton residences  vail and units at one ski hill place in breckenridge available for sale 
we cannot predict the ultimate number of units that we will sell  the ultimate price we will receive  or when the units will sell  although we currently believe the selling process will take multiple years 
additionally  if a prolonged weakness in the real estate market or general economic conditions were to occur we may have to adjust our selling prices more than currently anticipated in an effort to sell and close on units available for sale 
however  our risk associated with adjusting selling prices to levels that may not be acceptable to us is partially mitigated by the fact that we do generate cash flow from placing unsold units into our rental program until such time selling prices are at acceptable levels to us 
furthermore  if the current weakness in the real estate market were to persist for multiple years thus requiring us to sell remaining units below recent pricing levels including any sales concessions and discounts for the remaining inventory of units at the ritz carlton residences  vail or one ski hill place in breckenridge  it may result in an impairment charge on one or both projects see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of july  as well as million available under the revolver component of our credit agreement which represents the total commitment of million less certain letters of credit outstanding of million 
additionally  we believe that the terms of our notes and our credit agreement allow for sufficient flexibility in our ability to make future acquisitions  investments  distributions to stockholders and incur additional debt 
this  combined with the completion of our real estate projects where the proceeds from future real estate closings on the ritz carlton residences  vail  and one ski hill place in breckenridge are expected to significantly exceed future carrying costs  and the continued positive cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures has and is anticipated to continue to provide us with significant liquidity which we believe will allow us to consider strategic investments and other forms of providing return to our stockholders including the continued payment of a quarterly cash dividend 
we cannot predict that any strategic initiatives undertaken will achieve the anticipated results 
on march   our board of directors approved a increase to the annual cash dividend to an annual rate of per share  subject to quarterly declaration 
this increased our regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock by approximately million or approximately million annually 
our dividends have been funded through available cash on hand 
subject to the discretion of the board of directors  applicable law and contractual restrictions  we anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the amount  if any  of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our available cash on hand  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  restrictions contained in our credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 
under gaap we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as well as on an interim basis to the extent factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of our reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets below book value and we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of our reporting units and terminal values of the businesses using projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams  and we evaluate long lived assets based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
our fiscal annual impairment test did not result in a goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
however  if lower than projected levels of cash flows were to occur due to prolonged abnormal weather conditions or a prolonged weakness in general economic conditions  among other risks  it could cause less than expected growth and or a reduction in terminal values and cash flows and could result in an impairment charge attributable to certain goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and or long lived assets particularly related to our lodging operations  negatively impacting our results of operations and stockholders equity

fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  our resorts experienced historically low snowfall with cumulative snowfall down more than over the prior ski season and one of the mildest winters on record  including over the key christmas  spring break and easter periods 
these weather conditions adversely impacted our skier visitation which was down with our colorado and tahoe resorts down and  respectively for the ski season compared to the prior ski season 
despite these unprecedented adverse conditions  revenues were generally stabilized by increased season pass sales  higher pricing and increased average guest spend 
additionally  mountain reported ebitda for fiscal was unfavorably impacted as compared to fiscal due to the inclusion of first quarter operating results and transaction costs of northstar acquired on october  in fiscal which generated million of negative ebitda due to no ski operations partially offset by prior year acquisition costs of million  and due to the timing of the acquisition of kirkwood acquired on april  which generated million of negative ebitda and acquisition related costs incurred on kirkwood and skiinfo acquired on february  of million 
lift revenue remained relatively flat for fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulting from a million  or  increase in season pass revenue  offset by a million  or  decrease in lift revenue excluding season pass revenue 
the increase in season pass revenue was driven primarily by an increase in pricing for season pass products as well as a increase in unit sales 
the decline in lift revenue excluding season pass revenue was due to a decline in visitation excluding season pass holders of  compared to fiscal  partially offset by an increase in etp excluding season pass holders of  or

ski school revenue increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  with our colorado resorts ski school revenue increasing million  or  compared to fiscal although all of our resorts were negatively impacted by a decline in skier visitation as discussed above  the impact to ski school revenue resulting from lower visitation was entirely offset by improved yields per skier visit 
ski school revenue benefited from an overall increase in yield per skier visit primarily due to higher guest penetration and pricing compared to fiscal dining revenue increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  which was primarily driven by a increase in yield per skier visit during the ski season  offset by the decline in skier visitation as discussed above  and the impact of later terrain openings and earlier closings of certain dining facility operations during the ski season 
additionally  dining revenue was favorably impacted by the opening of new on mountain dining venues in vail and northstar  as well as higher summer visitation  particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to fiscal retail rental revenue increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  which was primarily driven by an increase in retail sales of million generated by our on line retailer acquired in july and increased sales at our colorado front range stores which were primarily attributable to strong sales at pre ski season sales events 
partially offsetting these increases were declines in retail sales occurring at stores proximate to our tahoe resorts and our any mountain stores in the san francisco bay area resulting from historically low snowfall and unseasonably warm weather during the ski season compared to the ski season 
additionally  impacting retail rental revenue was a decline in rental revenue of million  or  compared to fiscal  due to the decline in skier visitation as discussed above 
other revenue mainly consists of private club revenue which includes both club dues and amortization of initiation fees  summer visitation and other mountain activities revenue  marketing and internet advertising revenue  commercial leasing revenue  employee housing revenue  municipal services revenue and other recreation activity revenue

total skier visitation was up and excluding northstar  skier visitation was up  which significantly exceeded skier visitation growth for the us ski industry as a whole for the ski season  which was up  and visitation for all resorts in the rocky mountain and pacific southwest regions  which were up and down  respectively  despite all regions in the us generally having strong snowfall during the ski season  including at our resorts 
vail mountain and keystone in particular showed large increases in visitation in fiscal  vail mountain benefiting from recent capital investments made both on vail mountain and in base areas  including an improved lodging bed base  and keystone benefiting from a broadened family focused marketing initiative 
all resorts were unfavorably impacted by the timing of the easter holiday which was in late april in fiscal  versus early april in fiscal in addition  our heavenly resort was impacted by higher than average resort closures due to severe weather in fiscal etp  excluding season pass holders and northstar  increased  or  due primarily to price increases implemented during fiscal total etp  excluding northstar  increased  or  also due primarily to price increases implemented during fiscal  partially offset by higher average visitation by our season pass holders in fiscal ski school revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal with fiscal benefiting from the acquisition of northstar

gtlc s room revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and was driven by increases in both adr and occupancy as gains in occupancy were largely driven by improved weather conditions in may and june compared to the prior year 
our colorado lodging resort properties room revenue was adversely impacted by a decline in occupancy in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in transient guest visitation which was adversely impacted by a decrease in skier visitation at our colorado ski resorts as discussed in the mountain segment 
also negatively impacting revenue from owned hotel rooms for fiscal compared to fiscal was a decline in group business at our keystone resort  as well as the closure of breckenridge mountain lodge

since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  the revenue and corresponding expense have no effect on our lodging reported ebitda 
the decrease in revenue from payroll cost reimbursement and the corresponding reimbursed payroll costs in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a reduction in the number of managed hotel properties where we are the employer as announced under the rockresorts reorganization plan 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue from owned hotel rooms increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal which was driven by an increase in occupancy of percentage points due to higher group business and transient guest visitation primarily at properties proximate to our resorts as a result of increased skier visitation as discussed in the mountain segment for fiscal of this management s discussion and analysis 
gtlc room revenue for fiscal was relatively flat compared to fiscal as occupancy was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal due to unfavorable weather conditions in may and june resulting in a decline in revenue of million 
revenue from managed condominium rooms increased million  or  for fiscal compared to the fiscal  and was primarily due to the addition of managed condominium rooms in the lake tahoe region  which generated million in revenue and the addition of managed condominium rooms at one ski hill place in breckenridge which generated million in revenue

other expense  excluding the cme settlement  increased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased fuel costs  as well as other variable operating costs associated with increased occupancy and volume including higher food and beverage cost of sales  credit card fees and other operating expense 
revenue from payroll cost reimbursement and the corresponding reimbursed payroll costs relates to payroll costs at managed hotel properties where the company is the employer and all payroll costs are reimbursed by the owners of the properties under contractual arrangements

our real estate operating revenue is primarily determined by the timing of closings and the mix of real estate sold in any given period 
different types of projects have different revenue and profit margins  therefore  as the real estate inventory mix changes it can greatly impact real estate segment net revenue  operating expense and real estate reported ebitda 
fiscal real estate segment net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closing of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  and seven condominium units at one ski hill place million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the average price per square foot for both these projects is driven by their premier locations and the comprehensive and exclusive amenities related to these projects 
in addition to the revenue generated by the closing of units as noted above  real estate net revenue also included rental revenue from placing certain of our unsold units into our rental program 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million primarily resulting from the closing of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail average cost per square foot of and from the closing of seven condominium units at one ski hill place average cost per square foot of 
the cost per square foot for both these projects is reflective of the high end features and amenities and high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which includes marketing expense for the real estate available for sale including those units that have not yet closed  carrying costs for units available for sale and overhead costs  such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
in addition  included in other segment operating expense is a million charge recorded due to a dispute with contractors and an insurance carrier over the recovery of costs incurred by us in the fourth quarter of fiscal for remediation work at the arrabelle project 
this charge was partially offset by the receipt in the fourth quarter of fiscal of a million settlement for alleged damages caused by the architect on the arrabelle project included as a credit to other expense

the one ski hill place average price per square foot was driven by its premier ski in ski out location at the base of peak in breckenridge  its close proximity to the breckconnect gondola and other lifts and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
additionally  during fiscal we recognized million of revenue related to deposits from buyers who defaulted on units under contract at one ski hill place  and recorded a gain on sale of real property of million net of million in related cost of sales for a land parcel located at the arrowhead base area of the beaver creek resort which sold for million

other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which includes marketing expense for the real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs  such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
other items in addition to segment operating results  the following material items contribute to our overall financial position 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for both fiscal and fiscal increased over the applicable prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the fixed asset base due to incremental capital expenditures  assets acquired or placed in service at northstar acquired in october and depreciation on unsold one ski hill place and ritz carlton residences  vail units that are included in our rental program 
loss on disposal of fixed assets  net 
loss on disposal of fixed assets increased for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal due to increased removal and disposal costs associated with recent capital expenditures 
net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased million from fiscal to fiscal due to our acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in ssv on april   resulting in us holding interest in ssv 
asset impairment charge 
we previously extended a million note receivable  including accrued interest  to an entity that owned a hotel that we managed 
this entity was in default on certain debt owed by it and the third party owners of the entity were unable to reach an agreement to restructure the debt with their creditor 
as a result  the creditor foreclosed on the hotel in june as such  we recorded an asset impairment charge relating to the note receivable of million in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal loss on extinguishment of debt 
in april  we issued million of notes  the proceeds of which  along with available cash resources  were used to retire the outstanding million principal amount of notes and paid related call premiums  issuance costs  transaction and legal fees 
total costs to retire the notes and issuance costs for the notes were million  of which million were recorded as deferred financing costs and million was recorded as a loss on extinguishment 
additionally  included in the loss on extinguishment is a write off of a portion of unamortized debt issuance costs and legal fees associated with the notes 
interest expense  net 
interest expense was relatively flat for fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower interest expense from the issuance of the notes and the extinguishment of the notes in fiscal  mostly offset by capitalized interest recorded on the ritz carlton residences  vail development project in fiscal interest expense increased for fiscal compared to fiscal and is primarily due to the significant reduction in the capitalization of interest on self funded real estate projects as all real estate projects under development reached completion 
capitalized interest was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal income taxes 
our effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our tax provision and effective tax rate are driven primarily by the amount of pre tax income  which is adjusted for items that are deductible non deductible for tax purposes only ie permanent items  taxable income generated by state jurisdictions that varies from the consolidated pre tax income and the amount of net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was largely driven by the higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests recorded in fiscal additionally  the income tax provision recorded for fiscal   and  reflects million  million  and million  respectively  of income tax benefits due to a reversal of income tax contingencies resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations 
in  we amended previously filed tax returns for the tax years from through in an effort to remove restrictions under section of the internal revenue code on approximately million of nols relating to fresh start accounting from our reorganization in as a result  we requested a refund related to the amended returns in the amount of million and have reduced our federal tax liability in the amount of million in subsequent tax returns 
in  the irs completed its examination of our filing position in our amended returns and disallowed our request for refund and our position to remove the restriction on the nols 
we appealed the examiner s disallowance of the nols to the office of appeals 
in december  the office of appeals denied our appeal  as well as a request for mediation 
we disagreed with the irs interpretation disallowing the utilization of the nols and in august  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado seeking recovery of million in over payments that were previously denied by the irs  plus interest 
on july   the district court granted us summary judgment  concluding that the irs s decision disallowing the utilization of the nols was inappropriate 
the irs is entitled to appeal the decision of the district court to grant the motion for summary judgment and we do not know whether the irs will do so or  if it does appeal  whether the appeal would be successful 
we are also a party to two related tax proceedings in the united states tax court regarding calculation of nol carryover deductions for tax years  and the two proceedings involve substantially the same issues as the litigation in the district court wherein we disagree with the irs as to the utilization of nols 
at this time  however  it is uncertain whether or how the potential resolution of the district court case may affect these tax court proceedings 
since the legal proceeding surrounding the utilization of the nols has not been fully resolved  including a determination of the amount of refund and the possibility that the district court s ruling may be appealed by the irs  there remains considerable uncertainty of what portion  if any  of the nols will be realized  and as such  we have not reflected any of the benefits of the utilization of the nols within our financial statements 
however  the range of potential reversal of other long term liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that would be recorded as a benefit to our income tax provision is between zero and million 
reconciliation of non gaap measures the following table reconciles from segment reported ebitda to net income attributable to vail resorts  inc in thousands year ended july  mountain reported ebitda lodging reported ebitda resort reported ebitda real estate reported ebitda total reported ebitda depreciation and amortization loss on disposal of fixed assets  net investment income  net interest expense  net asset impairment charge loss on extinguishment of debt income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to vail resorts  inc the following table reconciles net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents in thousands july  long term debt long term debt due within one year total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt liquidity and capital resources significant sources of cash historically  we have lower cash available as of our fiscal year end as well as at the end of our first fiscal quarter of each year as compared to our second and third fiscal quarter ends primarily due to the seasonality of our mountain segment operations 
additionally  cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by the timing or mix of closings on and investment in real estate development projects 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents as of july   compared to million as of july  we generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million and million generated during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we currently anticipate that resort reported ebitda will continue to provide a significant source of future operating cash flows combined with proceeds from the sale of remaining inventory of real estate available for sale from the completed ritz carlton residences  vail and one ski hill place at breckenridge projects 
in addition to our million of cash and cash equivalents at july   we have available million under our credit agreement which represents the total commitment of million less certain letters of credit outstanding of million 
we believe the credit agreement  which matures in  provides adequate flexibility and is priced favorably with any new borrowings currently being priced at libor plus 
fiscal compared to fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  a decrease of million when compared to the million of cash generated in fiscal the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily a result of a reduction in proceeds from real estate closings that occurred in fiscal  which generated million in net proceeds net of sales commissions and deposits previously received compared to million generated in net proceeds net of sales commissions and deposits previously received in fiscal  which included the sale of units at the ritz carlton residences  vail to the ritz carlton development company pursuant to a contractual agreement when that project received its certificate of occupancy 
partially offsetting the decline in proceeds from real estate sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was a decrease in investments in real estate of million and a reduction in real estate payables of million in fiscal due to the completion of construction at our real estate projects 
additionally  cash from operating activities was impacted by the lower resort reported ebitda for fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in the amount of prepaid expenses and other assets  net of an increase in inventory purchases 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the prior year acquisition of northstar in october for million net of cash assumed  mostly offset by an increase in resort capital expenditures of million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the acquisition of kirkwood and skiinfo for a combined million net of cash assumed in fiscal cash used in financing activities decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the prior year repayment of million outstanding under the credit agreement in fiscal and the prior year payment of financing costs associated with the issuance of the notes and extinguishment of the notes and the amended and restated credit agreement of million  almost entirely offset by the repurchase of common stock of million and an increase in the payment of cash dividends on common stock of million in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  an increase of million when compared to the million of cash generated in fiscal the increase in operating cash flows was partially a result of an increase in the number of real estate closings that occurred in fiscal which generated million in net proceeds net of sales commissions and deposits previously received compared to million generated in net proceeds net of sales commissions and deposits previously received in fiscal additionally  investments in real estate decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal as our real estate projects under development reached completion 
additionally  improvements in our resort operations  including from northstar which was acquired in october  resulted in an increase in resort reported ebitda of million in fiscal compared to fiscal partially offsetting the above items were an increase in the change in accounts receivable and inventory of million partially due to the northstar acquisition and a decrease in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to a reduction in real estate payables 
cash used in investing activities increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the acquisition of northstar in october for million net of cash assumed  an increase in resort capital expenditures of million in fiscal  and the cash receipt of million primarily related to a land parcel we sold in fiscal  all of which was partially offset by the acquisition of mountain news corporation for million in fiscal cash used in financing activities increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in cash used in financing cash flows was primarily due to the repayment of million outstanding under the credit agreement in fiscal  payment of financing costs associated with the offering of the notes and retirement of the notes and the amended and restated credit agreement of million  and cash dividends on common stock of million in fiscal the above was partially offset by the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in ssv in fiscal for million on april  and the repurchase of common stock for million in fiscal significant uses of cash our cash uses currently include providing for operating expenditures and capital expenditures for assets to be used in resort operations and to a substantially lesser degree real estate future development projects 
we have historically invested significant cash in capital expenditures for our resort operations  and we expect to continue to make significant investments in the future subject to operating performance particularly as it relates to discretionary projects 
current capital expenditure levels will primarily include investments that allow us to maintain our high quality standards  as well as certain incremental discretionary improvements at our ski resorts and throughout our owned hotels 
we evaluate additional discretionary capital improvements based on an expected level of return on investment 
we currently anticipate we will spend approximately million to million of resort capital expenditures for calendar year which includes incremental capital related to kirkwood and initial estimated summer related activities capital 
included in these capital expenditures are approximately million to million including kirkwood  which are necessary to maintain appearance and level of service appropriate to our resort operations  including routine replacement of snow grooming equipment and rental fleet equipment 
approximately million was spent for capital expenditures in calendar year as of july   leaving approximately million to million to spend in the remainder of calendar year discretionary expenditures for calendar include replacement of an existing chairlift with a new state of the art passenger gondola at vail mountain  replacement and enhancement of retail rental point of sales system  development of new functionality for epicmix including epicmix racing  investment in energy efficient snowmaking equipment and technology  continued renovations at the doubletree by hilton owned lodging property formerly the great divide lodge  and upgrades and integration to our marketing database and it infrastructure  among other projects 
additionally  our resort capital expenditures beyond calendar year could increase as a result of our anticipated new summer activities plan epic discovery  among other initiatives 
we currently plan to utilize cash on hand  borrowings available under our credit agreement and or cash flow generated from future operations to provide the cash necessary to execute our capital plans 
principal payments on the vast majority of our long term debt million of the total million debt outstanding as of july  are not due until fiscal and beyond 
as of july  and  total long term debt including long term debt due within one year was million and million  respectively 
net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents increased from million as of july  to million as of july  our debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as we had million of variable rate debt outstanding as of july  a basis point change in libor would cause our annual interest payments to change by approximately million 
the fluctuation in our debt service requirements  in addition to interest rate changes  may be impacted by future borrowings under our credit agreement or other alternative financing arrangements we may enter into 
our long term liquidity needs are dependent upon operating results that impact the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital expenditures  flexibility of investment activities and the ability to obtain favorable future financing 
we can respond to liquidity impacts of changes in the business and economic environment by managing our capital expenditures and the timing of new real estate development activity 
our share repurchase program is conducted under authorizations made from time to time by our board of directors 
the board of directors initially authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock march  and later authorized additional repurchases of up to  additional shares july  
during the year ended july   we repurchased  shares of common stock 
since inception of this stock repurchase program through july   we have repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
as of july    shares remained available to repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization 
shares of common stock purchased pursuant to the repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used for the issuance of shares under the company s employee share award plan 
repurchases under these authorizations may be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by applicable laws  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
the timing as well as the number of shares that may be repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors  including our future financial performance  our available cash resources and competing uses for cash that may arise in the future  the restrictions in our credit agreement and the indenture  dated as of april  among us  the guarantors therein and the bank of new york mellon trust company  na as trustee indenture  governing the notes  prevailing prices of our common stock and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that we believe are attractive 
these authorizations have no expiration date 
on june   our board of directors approved the commencement of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock at an annual rate of per share  subject to quarterly declaration 
on march  our board of directors approved a increase to our annual cash dividend to an annual rate of per share or million annually based upon shares outstanding as of july   subject to quarterly declaration 
for the year ended july   we paid cash dividends of per share million in the aggregate 
our dividends were funded through available cash on hand 
subject to the discretion of our board of directors  applicable law and contractual restrictions  we anticipate paying regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the amount  if any  of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our available cash on hand  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  restrictions contained in our credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 
covenants and limitations we must abide by certain restrictive financial covenants under our credit agreement and the indenture 
the most restrictive of those covenants include the following credit agreement covenants net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and the interest coverage ratio each as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  our financing arrangements  including the indenture  limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  enter into certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit our ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
our borrowing availability under the credit agreement is primarily determined by the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on our segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in our debt instruments as of july  we expect that we will meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in our credit agreement  including the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio throughout the year ending july  however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet such financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  we would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks who are parties to the credit agreement 
there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
contractual obligations as part of our ongoing operations  we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements  lease agreements and construction agreements in conjunction with our resort capital expenditures 
debt obligations  which total million as of july   are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
obligations under construction contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet until services and or goods are received which is in accordance with gaap 
additionally  operating lease and service contract obligations  which total million as of july   are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  which is in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands payments due by period fiscal more than contractual obligations total years years years long term debt fixed rate interest operating leases and service contracts purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the fixed rate interest payments  as well as long term debt payments  included in the table above assume that all fixed rate debt outstanding as of july  will be held to maturity 
interest payments associated with variable rate debt have not been included in the table 
assuming that our million of variable rate long term debt as of july  is held to maturity  and utilizing interest rates in effect at july   our annual interest payments including commitment fees and letter of credit fees on variable rate long term debt as of july  is anticipated to be approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for at least each of the next three years subsequent to fiscal the future annual interest obligations noted herein are estimated only in relation to debt outstanding as of july   and do not reflect interest obligations on potential future debt 
purchase obligations primarily include amounts which are classified as trade payables  accrued payroll and benefits  accrued fees and assessments  accrued taxes including taxes for uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  and other commitments for goods and services not yet received  including construction contracts not included on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  in accordance with gaap 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet transactions that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenue  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the most critical accounting policies which were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we also have other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate held for sale and investment description we evaluate each real estate project on at least a quarterly basis to determine if indicators of potential impairment exist 
impairment indicators are assessed separately for each real estate project and include  but are not limited to current economic conditions  the local real estate market and the number and type of real estate units we have available for sale  expected selling prices  net margins on units closed in recent months and projected margins on remaining units that are available for sale 
a real estate project is considered impaired when its carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future net cash flows the project is expected to generate 
judgments and uncertainties we determine the estimated cash flows by project starting with the current listing price of all units remaining to be sold by project which is then reduced by an estimate for sales discounts and concessions anticipated to be given to buyers over the remaining estimated sales period that takes into consideration the current economic environment  local real estate market and the type of real estate we have held for sale  marketing fees paid in conjunction with units to be sold  as applicable  estimated sales commissions and other closing costs including title  transfer and escrow fees  and estimated net carrying costs until units are sold  the sum of all which is compared to the carrying value for each individual real estate project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions based upon the analysis performed throughout fiscal  the estimated future cash flows of our real estate projects were in excess of their respective carrying values and as such no impairment charge has been recognized 
cash flows require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors such as the ultimate selling price of individual units within a project and the estimated absorption period in which units are expected to be sold 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
for example  as of july   if our anticipated net cash proceeds after sales concessions  discounts  selling and closing costs on the remaining inventory of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail and one ski hill place in breckenridge were to decline by approximately compared to our current estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge on one or both of these projects 
goodwill and intangible assets description the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset below its carrying value 
other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment only when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
judgments and uncertainties application of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is primarily determined using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams 
these analyses require significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  available industry market data to the extent available  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business including expectations and assumptions regarding the impact of the timing and degree of any economic recovery  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur including terminal multiples  determination of the respective weighted average cost of capital and market participant assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and allocate goodwill to our reporting units based on the reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition generating the goodwill 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually as of may st of each year 
based upon our annual impairment test performed during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values  and as such no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed and the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 
however  we determined that our colorado lodging reporting unit million of goodwill as of july  within our lodging segment was at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test  with the fair value of the reporting unit estimated at approximately in excess of its carrying value and therefore is at risk for a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows  terminal value multiples and or weighted average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis 
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our colorado lodging reporting unit may include such items as i prolonged adverse weather conditions  ii a prolonged weakness in the general economic conditions in which the colorado lodging reporting unit operates and therefore negatively impacting group and transient room nights and adr  iii an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and or degree  and iv volatility in the equity and debt markets which could result in a higher discount rate 
while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units in excess of carrying values  if our assumptions are not realized  it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future 
however  it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 
tax contingencies description we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which we may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with our various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and we have adequate reserves for our tax contingencies  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves and tax provisions that could be material 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and could possibly result in increased tax expense and effective tax rate and or adjustments to our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in our tax expense  effective tax rate  income taxes payable  other long term liabilities and or adjustments to our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in the year of settlement or in future years 
depreciable lives of assets description mountain and lodging operational assets  furniture and fixtures  computer equipment  software  vehicles and leasehold improvements are primarily depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets may become obsolete or require replacement before the end of their useful life in which the remaining book value would be written off or we could incur costs to remove or dispose of assets no longer in use 
judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our useful lives of the assets contain uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the useful life of the asset 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increased expense related to depreciable assets disposed of  removed or taken out of service prior to its originally estimated useful life  which may be material 
a decrease in the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets would have increased depreciation expense by approximately million for fiscal new accounting standards refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 
inflation although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  we generally have been able to pass the increase on to our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on our future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results our mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenue and profits for our mountain and most of our lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for our nps concessionaire properties  certain managed hotel properties and our golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season results in operating losses
