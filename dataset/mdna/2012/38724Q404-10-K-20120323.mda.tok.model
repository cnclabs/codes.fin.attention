overview we operate modern american casual dining restaurants under the names granite city food brewery and cadillac ranch all american bar grill 
as of march   we operated granite city restaurants in states and five cadillac ranch restaurants in four states 
the granite city restaurant theme is upscale casual dining with a wide variety of menu items that are prepared fresh daily  including granite city s award winning signature line of hand crafted beers finished on site 
the extensive menu features moderately priced favorites served in generous portions 
granite city s attractive price point  high service standards  and great food and beer combine for a memorable dining experience 
cadillac ranch focuses on bringing authentic  all american cuisine to customers in a fun  dynamic 
table of contents environment 
the cadillac ranch menu is diverse with offerings ranging from homemade meatloaf to pasta dishes  all freshly prepared using quality ingredients 
our industry can be significantly affected by changes in economic conditions  discretionary spending patterns  consumer tastes  and cost fluctuations 
in recent years  consumers have been under increased economic pressures and as a result  many have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
although negative trends in consumer spending within the casual dining sector appear to be easing  many consumers continue to dine out less frequently than in the past and or have decreased the amount they spend on meals while dining out 
to offset the negative impact of decreased sales  we undertook a series of initiatives to renegotiate the pricing of various aspects of our business  effectively reducing our cost of food  insurance  payroll processing  shipping  supplies and our property and equipment rent 
we also implemented marketing initiatives designed to increase brand awareness and help drive guest traffic 
we believe these initiatives contributed to the increase in sales and guest traffic in fiscal year over that of  as well as the increase in both sales and guest traffic in over we believe that our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the operating results of our restaurants  changes in food and labor costs  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  nutritional concerns and discretionary spending patterns  competitive factors  the skill and the experience of our restaurant level management teams  the maturity of each restaurant  adverse weather conditions in our markets  our ability to recommence our expansion plans  and the timing of any future restaurant openings and related expenses 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the last tuesday of december to account for our operations 
all references to and within the following discussion represent the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
fiscal years and each consisted of weeks 
our fiscal year ended december  included  operating weeks  which is the sum of the actual number of weeks each restaurant operated 
our fiscal year ended december  included  restaurant weeks 
we provide the statistical measure of restaurant weeks to enhance the comparison of revenue from period to period as changes occur in the number of restaurants we are operating 
our restaurant revenue is comprised almost entirely of the sales of food and beverages 
the sale of retail items typically represents less than one percent of total revenue 
product costs include the costs of food  beverages and retail items 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related costs 
pre opening costs consist of direct costs related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  the salaries and related costs of our new store opening team  rent expense incurred during the construction period and other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations  which include management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  market research  professional fees  supplies and corporate rent 
acquisition costs are expenses related to due diligence performed as part of the potential acquisition of assets 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures at the restaurant and corporate levels and amortization of intangibles that do not have indefinite lives 
interest expense represents the cost of interest expense on debt and capital leases net of interest income on invested assets 

table of contents results of operations as a percentage of sales the following table sets forth results of our operations expressed as a percentage of sales for fiscal years and fiscal year ended december  december  restaurant revenue cost of sales food  beverage and retail labor direct restaurant operating occupancy total cost of sales pre opening general and administrative acquisition costs depreciation and amortization exit or disposal activities loss gain on disposal of assets operating loss interest income expense net interest expense net loss certain percentage amounts do not sum due to rounding 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of our financial statements property and equipment the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to years 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the initial term of the related lease  which is generally to years 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes 
amortization of assets acquired under capital lease is included in depreciation expense 
we review property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired pursuant the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived 
table of contents assets 
we base this assessment upon the carrying value versus the fair market value of the asset and whether or not that difference is recoverable 
such assessment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis and includes other relevant facts and circumstances including the physical condition of the asset 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
we continually reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates we have made 
leasing activities we have entered into various leases for our buildings  equipment and for ground leases 
at the inception of a lease  we evaluate it to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease pursuant to the fasb guidance on accounting for leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the date the lease agreement is signed and ends on the date the restaurant opens  during which no cash rent payments are typically due 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater pre opening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rent payments based upon restaurants sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease which can impact the classification and account for a lease as capital or operating 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  rent expense and interest expense than would be reported if different assumptions were made 
stock based compensation we have granted stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fasb fair value recognition guidance 
stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
under the black scholes option pricing model  we determine the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date 
this requires judgment  including but not limited to judgment concerning the expected volatility and forfeiture of our stock 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
revenue recognition revenue is derived from the sale of prepared food and beverage and select retail items and is recognized at the time of sale 
revenue derived from gift card sales is recognized at the time the gift card is redeemed 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  the outstanding balances on such cards are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
when we determine 
table of contents there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions  we periodically recognize gift card breakage which represents the portion of our gift card obligation for which management believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote  based upon historical redemption patterns 
such amounts are included as a reduction to general and administrative expense 
we arrive at this amount using certain management judgments and estimates 
such judgments and estimates may produce different amounts of breakage than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
estimated liability for closing restaurants we continually evaluate the performance of each of our restaurants 
if a restaurant consistently performs poorly  we consider many factors including the demographics of the location and the likelihood of being able to improve the performance of the restaurant 
if we determine that the restaurant will not  within a reasonable period of time  perform to our expectations  we may close the restaurant 
in the event we close a restaurant  we record the liability to cover future lease termination costs using the fair value of these liabilities as estimated in accordance with the fasb guidance on accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this estimate is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee we expect to pay 
the amount of the estimated liability established is generally the present value of these estimated future minimum lease payments offset by the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained upon exiting the property 
a significant assumption we use in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing a restaurant is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant restaurants  determined based on the likelihood of successfully negotiating an early termination of the lease agreement with our landlord or subleasing the property 
if it takes longer than anticipated to terminate or sublease the lease  we may need to record additional estimated liability 
if the lease on the vacant restaurant is not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liability  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the lease on the vacant restaurant is terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liability  we would reverse all or some portion of the previously established estimated liability  resulting in an increase in operating income 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december  revenue we generated  and  of revenue during fiscal years and  respectively  an increase of 
approximately  of such increased revenue was generated from the cadillac ranch restaurants we acquired in the last two months of comparable restaurant revenue  which includes restaurants in operation over months  includes all of our granite city restaurants and excludes all of our cadillac ranch restaurants 
comparable restaurant revenue increased from to due primarily to an increase in guest traffic of 
the average weekly revenue per restaurant at our comparable restaurants increased  from  in to  in we expect that restaurant revenue will vary from quarter to quarter 
continued seasonal fluctuations in restaurant revenue are due in part to increased outdoor seating and weather conditions 
due to the honeymoon effect that periodically occurs with the opening of a restaurant  we expect the timing of any future restaurant openings to cause fluctuations in restaurant revenue 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as timing of holidays  consumer confidence in the economy and changes in consumer preferences may affect our future revenue 

table of contents restaurant costs food and beverage our food and beverage costs  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to in from while we experienced some cost increases  primarily in wine  bottled beer  certain protein and dairy  such increases were more than offset by decreases in tap beer  soft drink  chicken  and liquor costs 
while pricing negotiations with our suppliers have reduced our exposure to commodity price increases  we do expect that our food and beverage costs will continue to vary going forward due to numerous variables  including seasonal changes in food and beverage costs for certain products for which we do not have contracted pricing  fluctuations within commodity priced goods and guest preferences 
we periodically create new menu offerings and introduce new craft brewed beers based upon guest preferences 
although such menu modifications may temporarily result in increased food and beverage cost  we believe we are able to offset such increases with our weekly specials which provide variety and value to our guests 
our varieties of craft brewed beer  which we believe we can produce at a lower cost than beers we purchase for resale  also enable us to keep our food and beverage costs low while fulfilling guest requests and building customer loyalty 
labor labor expense consists of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items including management bonuses  and non cash stock based compensation expense 
our experience to date has been that staff labor costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
our labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to in from in while we experienced a slight increase in our employee benefits expense  our total labor expense decreased as a percent of revenue in non cash stock based compensation was  in compared to  in we expect that labor costs will vary as minimum wage laws  local labor laws and practices  and unemployment rates vary from state to state  as will hiring and training expenses 
we believe that retaining good employees and more experienced staff ensures high quality guest service and may reduce hiring and training costs 
direct restaurant operating operating supplies  repairs and maintenance  utilities  promotions and restaurant level administrative expense represent the majority of our direct restaurant operating expense  a portion of which is fixed or indirectly variable 
our direct restaurant operating expense  as a percentage of revenue  increased to in from in while we experienced decreases in utilities  printing and small wares  we had increases in marketing  paper and plastic  as well as maintenance and repair costs 
we continue to seek ways to reduce our direct operating costs going forward including additional pricing negotiations with suppliers and the elimination of waste 
occupancy our occupancy costs  which include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property insurance and property taxes  decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in our occupancy cost decreased due to the conversion of many of our leases from operating leases to capital leases 
as capital leases  a portion of the lease expense is recorded as interest expense and reduction of liability 
as operating leases  all lease expense 
table of contents is recorded as an occupancy cost included in rent expense 
during the second half of and in  lease amendments we entered into with the dunham landlords caused the classification of seven leases to change from operating leases to capital leases 
as a result  we expect our rent expense to continue to remain lower and our interest expense to continue to remain higher than such expenses were in additionally  in the second quarter of  we entered into lease amendments which reduced the monthly payments for eight of our restaurant properties 
in the first quarter of  we entered into rental abatement agreements for our restaurants in toledo  ohio and ft 
wayne  indiana 
pursuant to the agreements  we were required to pay  of the  in rents we had recorded as expense and withheld during negotiations in and as such  we wrote off the remaining deferred rents of approximately  to occupancy 
also included in our rent expense is the difference between our current rent payments and straight line rent expense over the initial lease term 
this non cash rent expense of  and  is included in occupancy costs in and  respectively 
the  decrease in non cash rent expense was due primarily to the changes in lease terms and conditions pursuant to lease amendments 
pre opening pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  wages and expenses of a new restaurant opening team during periods of expansion  rental costs incurred during the construction period and certain other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
pre opening costs  excluding construction period rent  are primarily incurred in the month of  and two months prior to  restaurant opening 
in  our pre opening costs of  were related to the granite city restaurant we plan to open in the second quarter of such costs are related primarily to travel  recruiting and hiring expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expense includes all salaries and benefits  including non cash stock based compensation  associated with our corporate staff that is responsible for overall restaurant quality  any future expansion into new locations  financial controls and reporting  restaurant management recruiting  management training  and excess capacity costs related to our beer production facility 
other general and administrative expense includes advertising  professional fees  investor relations  office administration  centralized accounting system costs and travel by our corporate management 
general and administrative expense increased  to  in from  in of this year to date increase   was non cash stock based compensation for employees and non employee board members 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased in over the primary sources of such increases were expenses related to employee compensation  travel  consulting and recruiting 
as we seek new ways to build revenue  we will continue to closely monitor our general and administrative costs and attempt to reduce these expenses as a percentage of revenue while preserving an infrastructure that remains suitable for our current operations 
although we may need to recruit additional personnel to provide continued oversight of operations  we expect our turnover ratios to return to levels more consistent with the industry  allowing us to better manage our employee costs 
to the extent our turnover increases above our expectations  additional costs above our budgeted figures could be incurred in our recruiting and training expenses 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  to  in from  in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation expense decreased to in from in we anticipate depreciation expense will increase as we complete enhancements at selected granite city restaurants including increased seating in the bars  enclosure of patios for year round service  and the addition of private dining rooms to accommodate private parties and reduce wait times during peak periods 
exit or disposal activities in august  we closed our rogers  arkansas granite city restaurant  which failed to generate positive cash flow since opening in october in the first quarter of  we entered into lease termination agreements regarding this property 
the lease termination agreement with the mall owner required us to pay  in cash and  payable under a five year promissory note with an annual interest rate of 
in order to offset the property development costs incurred by dcm  we entered into a lease termination agreement whereby we are required to pay dcm million under a year promissory note with an annual interest rate of 
interest payments related to these termination agreements will be recorded as exit and disposal activities 
pursuant to such agreements  we will incur no further costs associated with the property and have relinquished all equipment at the site 
we have written off all remaining assets  deferred rents and the sublease liability related to the rogers property

table of contents for up to two additional five year periods  calls for annual base rent starting at  we anticipate opening this restaurant in late summer interest net interest expense consists of interest expense on capital leases and long term debt  net of interest earned from cash on hand 
net interest expense increased  to  in from  in this increase was due to the reclassification of several of our leases from operating leases to capital leases 
as a result of such reclassifications  certain expense that was recorded as occupancy expense in was recorded as interest expense in we expect our interest expense will increase as we utilize our credit facility to build new granite city restaurants in select markets  add space through physical enhancements at key existing granite city restaurant locations and improve operational efficiencies through upgraded technology

funding operations and expansion during fiscal years and  we operated at a level that allowed us to fund our existing operations 
we believe this same level of sales and margins will allow us to fund our obligations for the 
table of contents foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate strategies for growth under the assumption that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from existing operations 
under such assumption and with the credit facility available to us  we are implementing a variety of initiatives both to generate new revenue and to invest in technologies to improve our existing business and financial condition 
furthermore  we believe the opportunity exists to begin increasing our number of granite city restaurants and thereby our future revenue and cash flow 
in addition  we believe such expansion will lessen turnover and related costs as we expect to be better able to retain managers and other key personnel who may otherwise seek new opportunities with other restaurant chains 
we expect to generate additional revenue through new store growth of our granite city concept  primarily within our existing geographic footprint 
we have begun construction of a new granite city restaurant on the property we own in troy  michigan 
we expect to open such restaurant in the second quarter of and we expect to open a new granite city restaurant in franklin  tennessee in late summer we are analyzing other potential new granite city restaurant sites and expect to increase revenue through expansion 
we also expect to close on and begin operating the cadillac ranch restaurant in pittsburgh  pennsylvania during the second quarter of at present  we have no plans to expand cadillac ranch while we integrate the operations of those restaurants 
we also seek to generate additional revenue through physical changes in some of our high volume granite city restaurants including increased seating in the bars  enclosure of patios for year round service  and the addition of private dining rooms to accommodate private parties  corporate events  and reduce wait times in peak periods 
we evaluate the costs of these potential capital enhancements relative to the projected revenue gains  thereby determining the expected return on investment of these potential store modifications 
we have identified five to eight existing granite city restaurants where we believe the modifications would meet these criteria 
we enhanced four granite city restaurants in and may complete three to four such modifications in we are currently evaluating the results of the four modifications completed in prior to committing to the additional modifications 
we also believe we can improve the efficiency of our restaurants with table management systems and kitchen management systems designed to increase table turnover  provide a higher level of service to our customers  improve overall dining experience  increase our sales  and improve our financial condition 
we had these systems fully implemented at five of our restaurants in the above objectives assume that  in addition to continued access to the credit facility  we continue to generate positive cash flow 
if we cease generating positive cash flow  our business could be adversely affected and we may be required to alter or cease our plans for expansion  store modifications and technological improvements 
our ability to continue funding our operations and meet our debt service obligations continues to depend upon our operating performance  and more broadly  achieving budgeted revenue and operating margins  both of which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the retail and casual dining industries and other factors  which may be beyond our control 
if revenue or margins  or a combination of both  decrease to levels unsustainable for continuing operations  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet ongoing obligations 
the amount of any such required funding would depend upon our ability to generate working capital

off balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations under contractual agreements and the timeframe within which payments on such obligations are due 
this table includes all lease amendments and long term debt agreements executed subsequent to december  this table does not include amounts related to contingent rent as such future amounts are not determinable 
in addition  whether we would incur any additional expense on our employment agreements depends upon the existence of a change in control of the company coupled with a termination of employment or other unforeseeable events 
therefore  neither contingent rent nor severance expense has been included in the following table 
payment due by period contractual obligations total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years fiscal years thereafter long term debt  principal interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease obligations  including interest purchase contracts total obligations while we are contractually obligated to make these purchases  we have the contractual right to defer such purchases into later years 
however  if we defer such purchases into later years  we may incur additional charges 
certain amounts do not sum due to rounding 
during the fiscal year ended december   we operated at a level that allowed us to fund our existing operations 
we believe this same level of sales and margins will allow us to fund our obligations for the foreseeable future 
in connection with the sale of series a preferred to cdp  we have been able to lower our occupancy cost 
although we expect to increase our number of granite city restaurants through expansion  we believe that continued access to our credit facility and the cash generated from existing operations will be sufficient to fund our current obligations 
seasonality we expect that our sales and earnings will fluctuate based on seasonal patterns 
we anticipate that our highest sales and earnings will occur in the second and third quarters due to the milder climate and availability of outdoor seating during those quarters in our markets 
additionally  because cadillac ranch restaurants are more entertainment based  certain restaurants will see a fluctuation in sales depending upon events in or around its location 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  supplies and labor costs 
a large percentage of our restaurant personnel is paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
in the past  we have been able to minimize the effect of these increases through menu price increases and other strategies 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
changes in interest rate pursuant to the terms of our credit facility agreement with fifth third bank  we will have a balloon payment due of approximately million on december  if it becomes necessary to refinance such balloon balance  we may not be able to obtain financing at the same interest rate 
the effect of a higher interest rate would depend upon the negotiated financing terms 
changes in commodity prices many of the food products and other commodities we use in our operations are subject to price volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
fluctuations in commodity prices and or long term changes could have an adverse effect on us 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
to manage this risk in part  we have entered into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
we have entered into contracts through with certain suppliers of raw materials primarily hops for minimum purchases both in terms of quantity and pricing 
as of december   our future obligations under such contracts aggregated approximately million 
although a large national distributor is our primary supplier of food  substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control commodity price risks 
additionally  we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  in response to food product price increases 
if  however  competitive circumstances limit our menu price flexibility  our margins could be negatively impacted 
our company does not enter into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes
