adjusted ebitda is a measure used by management to evaluate its operating performance 
it is reasonable to expect these reconciling items to occur in future periods  but for many of them the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period  do not relate directly to the ongoing operations of our healthcare facilities and complicate period to period comparisons of our results of operations and comparisons with other healthcare companies 
adjusted ebitda is not intended as a substitute for net income loss attributable to vanguard health systems  inc stockholders  operating cash flows or other cash flow statement data determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
additionally  adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management s discretionary use  since it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and other debt service requirements 
because adjusted ebitda is not a gaap measure and is susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted ebitda  as presented by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors  lenders  financial analysts and rating agencies as a measurement of our financial performance on the same basis as that viewed by management 
these groups have historically used ebitda related measures in the healthcare industry  along with other measures  to estimate the value of a company  to make informed investment decisions  to evaluate a company s operating performance compared to that of other companies in the healthcare industry  and to evaluate a company s leverage capacity and its ability to meet its debt service requirements 
adjusted ebitda eliminates the uneven effect of non cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets  much of which results from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
adjusted ebitda also eliminates the effects of changes in interest rates that management believes relate to general trends in global capital markets  but are not necessarily indicative of a company s operating performance 
many of the items excluded from adjusted ebitda result from decisions outside the control of operating management and may differ significantly from company to company due to differing long term decisions regarding capital structure  capital 
table of contents investment strategies  the tax jurisdictions in which the companies operate and unique circumstances of acquired entities 
adjusted ebitda is also used by us to measure individual performance for incentive compensation purposes and as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to our operating businesses and assessing their performance  both internally and relative to our peers  as well as to evaluate the performance of our operating management teams 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to vanguard health systems  inc stockholders for the respective periods presented in millions 
b licensed beds are those beds for which a facility has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state licensing agency 
c discharges represent the total number of patients discharged in the facility for a period in excess of hours from our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient volumes 
d adjusted discharges is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of consolidated inpatient and outpatient volumes 
adjusted discharges is computed by multiplying discharges by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and then dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
e net revenue per adjusted discharge is calculated by dividing net patient revenues by adjusted discharges  and measures the average net payment expected to be received for an episode of service provided to a patient 
f patient days represent the number of days calculated as overnight stays our beds were occupied by patients during the respective periods 
g adjusted patient days represent actual patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
h average length of stay represents the average number of days an admitted patient stays in our hospitals 
i inpatient surgeries represent the number of surgeries performed in our hospitals where overnight stays are necessary 
j outpatient surgeries represent the number of surgeries performed at our hospitals or ambulatory surgery centers on an outpatient basis patient overnight stay not necessary 
k emergency room visits represent the number of patient visits to a hospital based or freestanding emergency room where treatment is received  regardless of whether an overnight stay is subsequently required 
l member lives represent the total number of members in php  aahp  chs and vbic as of the end of the respective period 
m health plan claims expense percentage is calculated by dividing health plan claims expense by premium revenues 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and the information set forth under item selected financial data 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please read item a risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results may differ materially from those estimated or projected in any of these forward looking statements 
executive overview our mission is to help people in the communities we serve achieve health for life by delivering a patient centered experience in a high performance environment of integrated care 
we plan to grow our business by continually improving quality of care  transforming the delivery of care to a fee for value basis  expanding services and strengthening the financial performance of our existing operations  and selectively developing or acquiring other healthcare businesses where we see an opportunity to improve operating performance and expand our mission 
we believe this business strategy is a framework for long term success in an industry that is undergoing significant change  but we will continue to experience operating challenges in the short term until the general economy improves and our initiatives are fully implemented 
as of june   we owned and operated hospitals with a total of  licensed beds and related outpatient service facilities complementary to the hospitals in san antonio  harlingen and brownsville texas  metropolitan detroit  michigan  metropolitan phoenix  arizona  metropolitan chicago  illinois  and massachusetts 
as of june   we also owned four health plans with approximately  members 
during the year ended june   we integrated the acquisition of two hospitals and related healthcare services located in harlingen and brownsville  texas 
during fiscal  we acquired a total of hospitals and related healthcare services located in metropolitan detroit  metropolitan chicago  and metropolitan phoenix 
during the year ended june   our revenue growth was impacted by ongoing challenges including less demand for elective services  some of which related to a weakened general economy  and a shift from services provided to managed care enrollees to uninsured patients or to patients covered by lower paying medicaid plans 
we believe these challenges will not subside dramatically in the near future 
in addition  multiple states in which we operate reduced medicaid reimbursement levels during the past year  which reduced our revenues 
health plan premium revenues decreased during the year ended june   compared to the prior year due to capitation rate decreases at php implemented by arizona s medicaid plan and changes in eligibility qualification for certain categories of patients 
php was able to make adjustments to medicaid reimbursement rates to healthcare providers resulting in decreased claims expense 
we have been able to reduce certain costs to mitigate the impact of the limited revenue growth  but we are not certain these cost reduction measures will be sustainable if economic weakness persists during fiscal and beyond 
our comprehensive debt refinancing during january extended the maturities of our debt by up to five years 
our additional debt offerings in july  january and march and our initial public offering in june established a capital structure to fund our long term growth strategies 
new senior notes on march   we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of senior notes due the new notes in a private placement pursuant to the indenture  dated as of january   governing our existing senior notes due the new notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
we pay interest on the notes semi annually in cash in arrears on february and august of each year 
the new notes mature on february  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the new notes to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility on march credit facility debt in april  we received commitments  which became effective in may  from existing lenders to increase the borrowing capacity available under our revolving facility by million to million 

table of contents redemption of senior discount notes during the year ended june   we used the net proceeds from our initial public offering in june and the exercise of the over allotment option by the underwriters in july to redeem approximately million accreted value of our senior discount notes and to pay million of redemption premiums relating thereto 
the redemptions resulted in the recognition of debt extinguishment costs of approximately million  million net of taxes  representing tender premiums and other costs to redeem the senior discount notes and the write off of net deferred loan costs associated with the redeemed notes 
in addition  we redeemed approximately million of additional senior discount notes through privately negotiated transactions during the year ended june  the cumulative redemption of the senior discount notes during fiscal resulted in approximately million of remaining unredeemed accreted value of these notes outstanding as of june  the acquisitions our most recent and significant acquisitions during fiscal and are as follows valley baptist health system effective september   we acquired substantially all of the assets of valley baptist  including hospitals with a combined licensed beds located in harlingen  texas and brownsville  texas 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a management agreement  pursuant to which we are responsible for the management of valley baptist s operations 
we paid approximately million in cash at closing to acquire the net assets of valley baptist 
in addition to the cash investment  we also assumed certain of the seller s debt and issued a non controlling interest in the partnership to the seller 
we funded the cash investment with cash on hand 
the detroit medical center effective january   we purchased all of the assets of dmc other than donor restricted assets and certain other assets  which assets consisted primarily of eight acute care and specialty hospitals and related healthcare facilities in the metropolitan detroit  michigan area 
these eight hospitals are dmc children s hospital of michigan  dmc detroit receiving hospital  dmc harper university hospital  dmc huron valley sinai hospital  dmc hutzel women s hospital  dmc rehabilitation institute of michigan  dmc sinai grace hospital and dmc surgery hospital  with a combined  licensed beds 
we paid cash of million to acquire the dmc assets using cash on hand million of this amount represented acquisition related expenses 
as part of the dmc acquisition  we assumed all of its liabilities other than its outstanding bonds  certain other debt and certain other liabilities 
the assumed liabilities include a pension liability under a frozen defined benefit pension plan of dmc 
we also committed to spend million during the five years subsequent to closing for the routine capital needs of the dmc facilities and an additional million in capital expenditures during this same five year period  which latter amount relates to a specific project list agreed to between the dmc board of representatives and us 
to collateralize this million specified project capital commitment  we entered into a contingent unsecured subordinated promissory note payable to the legacy dmc entity in the principal amount of million 
the principal amount of the promissory note is reduced automatically as we expend capital or escrow cash related to this capital commitment 
operating environment we believe that the operating environment for hospital operators continues to evolve  which presents both challenges and opportunities for us 
in order to remain competitive in the markets we serve  we must transform our operating strategies to not only accommodate changing environmental factors but to make them operating advantages for us relative to our peers 
these factors will require continued focus on improving the quality of care  reducing costs and the integration of our ambulatory service lines 
the changes to the healthcare landscape that have begun or that we expect to begin in the immediate future are outlined below 
expansion of ambulatory and population health services as we attempt to remain flexible and competitive in a dynamic healthcare environment  we have added focus and resources to our ambulatory care endeavors 
we have pursued  or are pursuing  joint ventures in physician practice management and population health risk services with experienced companies or individuals that already operate in these disciplines 
we also continue to pursue the expansion of certain strategic health risk products  through either acquisition or partnership opportunities  to leverage the skill sets acquired through our physician practice and population health management efforts 
further  in our existing markets  we are pursuing the acquisition or development of ambulatory care facilities  such as 
table of contents ambulatory surgery centers  home health agencies  cancer centers and imaging centers  in an attempt to create a more comprehensive network of healthcare services 
management believes that the added focus on ambulatory care  together with the addition of new ambulatory competencies  will enable us to take advantage of future opportunities in the ambulatory care sector  especially in an era of health reform 
implementation of our clinical quality initiatives further governmental reimbursement will be impacted by quality of care 
we have implemented many of our expanded clinical quality initiatives and are in the process of implementing several others 
these initiatives include monthly review of reportable cms quality indicators  rapid response teams  continued focus on work flow efficiency and process improvement  establishing clinical standards of care across key system service lines  improving transition of care to reduce hospital readmissions and aligning hospital management incentive compensation with quality performance indicators 
physician alignment our ability to attract skilled physicians to our hospitals is critical to our success 
we believe that coordination of care and alignment of care strategies between hospitals and physicians will become more critical as reimbursement becomes more episode based 
as of june   we employed approximately non resident physicians and have continued to recruit primary care and specialty physicians and physician groups to the communities that we serve as market specific needs have warranted 
we have invested heavily in the infrastructure necessary to coordinate our physician alignment strategies and manage our physician operations 
we have established physician leadership councils  comprised of physicians focused on driving clinical and operational performance  at most of our hospitals to align the quality goals of our hospitals with those of the physicians who practice in our hospitals 
we also believe our hospitalist employment strategy is a key element in coordination of patient centered care 
because these initiatives require significant upfront investment and may take years to fully implement  our operating results and cash flows could be negatively impacted during the short term 
governmental regulation health reform law 
the provisions included in the health reform law  enacted in march  provide for  among other things  increased access to health benefits for a significant number of uninsured individuals through the creation of exchanges and expanded medicaid programs  reductions in future medicare reimbursement  including market basket and dsh payments  development of a payment bundling pilot program and similar programs to promote accountability and coordination of care  continued efforts to tie reimbursement to quality of care  including penalties for excessive readmissions and hospital acquired conditions  and changes to premiums paid and the establishment of profit restrictions on medicare managed care plans and exchange insurance plans 
the health reform law is also under considerable scrutiny from congress  and the states are moving at different speeds to implement portions of the health reform law left to their discretion 
we are unable to predict how the health reform law will impact our future financial position  operating results or cash flows  but we hope to transform our delivery of care to adapt to the changes from the health reform law that will be implemented during the next several years 
budget control act 
on august   congress enacted the budget control act of this law increased the nation s borrowing authority while taking steps to reduce federal spending and the deficit 
the deficit reduction component is being implemented in two phases 
in the first phase  the law imposes caps that reduce discretionary non entitlement spending by more than billion over ten years  beginning in ffy under a second phase  if spending and deficit amounts reach certain thresholds  an enforcement mechanism called sequestration will be triggered under which a total of trillion in automatic  across the board spending reductions must be implemented over ten years beginning in february the spending reductions are to be split evenly between defense and non defense discretionary spending  although certain programs including the medicaid and chip programs are exempt from these automatic spending reductions  and medicare expenditures cannot be reduced by more than two percent 
if sequestration goes into effect and these reductions are implemented  medicare payments to hospitals and for other services could be reduced 
congress may take additional action in or to further reduce federal spending and the deficit to avoid sequestration being triggered 
if so  medicare  medicaid and chip spending could be reduced further  and provider payments under those programs could be substantially reduced 
congress may consider legislation that would seek to further reduce the federal deficit  which could also further substantially reduce medicare and medicaid spending  including payments to providers 
accountable care organizations 
the health reform law requires the establishment of mssps that promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of acos 
mssp acos receive payment from medicare on a fee 
table of contents for service basis and may receive additional shared savings payments or be at risk for shared losses based on an increase or decrease in annual fee for service payments to the aco 
cms estimates that approximately organizations will enter into aco agreements with an estimated aggregate median impact of billion in bonus payments to acos for cys in addition to the mssp aco model  cms developed the pioneer aco model 
the pioneer aco model generally requires compliance with the mssp aco program rules in the final regulations  but differs from the finalized mssp aco model in several ways  including  but not limited to  higher levels of sharing and risk  opportunity for population based payments  requirements for outcomes based payment contracting with other payors and a higher number of assigned beneficiaries 
we submitted a pioneer aco application in michigan  and were approved to become a pioneer aco effective january  we have also been awarded mssp acos in massachusetts  illinois and san antonio 
we expect to continue to explore opportunities to develop or enhance acos in our markets 
medicare and medicaid ehr incentive payments 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of provides for medicare and medicaid incentive payments that began in calendar for eligible hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record ehr technology 
during the fiscal years ended june  and  our pre tax income was positively impacted by million and million  respectively  related to combined medicare and medicaid ehr incentives recognized 
we believe that the operational benefits of ehr technology  including improved clinical outcomes and increased operating efficiencies  will contribute to our long term ability to grow our business 
payer mix shifts during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year  we provided more healthcare services to patients who were uninsured and provided fewer healthcare services to patients who had insurance coverage 
much of this shift resulted from general economic weakness in the markets we serve and medicaid eligibility reductions in arizona 
for those with insurance coverage  we have experienced a shift during the past two years from managed care coverage to medicaid or managed medicaid coverage 
a portion of this shift also resulted from our acquisition of dmc  which provides a greater percentage of services to medicaid patients than our other facilities 
we are uncertain how long the economic weakness will continue  but believe that conditions will not improve significantly during our fiscal year 
cost pressures in order to demonstrate a highly reliable environment of care  we must hire and retain nurses who share our ideals and beliefs and who have access to the training necessary to implement our clinical quality initiatives 
while the national nursing shortage has abated somewhat during the past two years as a result of general economic weakness  the nursing workforce remains volatile 
as a result  we expect continuing pressures on nursing salaries and benefits costs 
these pressures include higher than normal base wage increases  demands for flexible working hours and other increased benefits  and higher nurse to patient ratios necessary to improve quality of care 
we have begun multiple initiatives to stabilize our nursing workforce  including a nurse leadership professional practice model and employee engagement strategies 
inflationary pressures and technological advancements continue to drive supply costs higher 
we have implemented multiple supply chain initiatives  including consolidation of low priced vendors  establishment of value analysis teams  stricter adherence to pharmacy formularies and coordination of care efforts with physicians to reduce physician preference items  but we are uncertain if we can sustain these reductions in future periods 
sources of revenues hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels  the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients  the volume of outpatient procedures  and the charges or payment rates for such services 
reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of payer  the type of service eg  acute care  intensive care or subacute and the geographic location of the hospital 
inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
we receive payment for patient services from the federal government  primarily under the medicare program  state medicaid programs  
table of contents health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations  managed medicare providers  managed medicaid providers and other private insurers  and individual patients 
the following table sets forth the percentages of net patient revenues by payer for each of the fiscal years ended june   and year ended june  medicare medicaid managed medicare managed medicaid managed care self pay other total see item business sources of revenues included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the traditional medicare plan both for inpatient and outpatient services  managed medicare plans  medicaid plans  managed medicaid plans and managed care plans 
in that section  we also discuss the unique reimbursement features of the traditional medicare plan  including disproportionate share  outlier cases and direct graduate and indirect medical education  including the annual medicare regulatory updates published by cms in august that impact reimbursement rates under the plan for services provided during the ffy beginning october  and the impact of the health reform law on these reimbursements 
volumes by payer during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june   discharges increased and adjusted discharges increased 
on a same store basis  discharges decreased  while adjusted discharges increased 
the following table provides details of discharges by payer for each of the fiscal years ended june   and year ended june  medicare medicaid managed medicare managed medicaid managed care self pay other total payer reimbursement trends in addition to the volume factors described above  patient mix  acuity factors and pricing trends affect our patient service revenues 
net patient revenue per adjusted discharge on a same store basis was   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
growth in this ratio continues to be limited by the payer mix shifts we have experienced during the past months 
a greater percentage of our discharges during the fiscal year ended june  was attributable to patients who had medicaid coverage or were uninsured as opposed to those with managed care coverage compared to the fiscal year ended june  we typically receive lower reimbursement for services provided to patients covered by medicaid  whether under such traditional or managed programs  than for those same services provided to patients 
table of contents with commercial managed care coverage 
accounts receivable collection risks leading to increased bad debts similar to other companies in the hospital industry  we face continued pressures in collecting outstanding accounts receivable primarily due to volatility in the uninsured and underinsured populations in the markets we serve 
the following table provides a summary of our accounts receivable payer class mix as of each respective period presented 
june  days days over days total medicare medicaid managed medicare managed medicaid managed care self pay self pay after primary other total june  days days over days total medicare medicaid managed medicare managed medicaid managed care self pay self pay after primary other total includes uninsured patient accounts only 
includes patient co insurance and deductible amounts after payment has been received from the primary payer 
our combined allowances for doubtful accounts  uninsured discounts and charity care covered and of combined self pay and self pay after primary accounts receivable as of june  and  respectively 
this ratio was and on a same store basis as of june  and  respectively 
see specific discussions that address payment delays and the aging of our accounts receivable at june   within the liquidity and capital resources operating activities section of this annual report on form k 
the volume of self pay accounts receivable remains sensitive to a combination of factors including price increases  acuity of services  higher levels of patient deductibles and co insurance under managed care plans  economic factors and the increased difficulties of uninsured patients who do not qualify for charity care programs to pay for escalating healthcare costs 
we have implemented policies and procedures designed to expedite upfront cash collections and promote repayment plans from our patients 
however  we believe bad debts will remain a significant risk for us and the rest of the hospital industry in the near term 
governmental and managed care payer reimbursement healthcare spending comprises a significant portion of total spending in the united states and has been growing at annual rates that exceed inflation  wage growth and gross national product 
there is considerable pressure on governmental payers  managed medicare medicaid payers and commercial managed care payers to control costs by either reducing or limiting 
table of contents increases in reimbursement to healthcare providers or limiting benefits to enrollees 
the current weakness in the us economy has magnified these pressures 
the demand for medicaid coverage has increased during the past two years due to job losses that have left many individuals without health insurance 
medicaid remains the highest individual program cost for most states  including those in which we operate 
to balance their budgets  many states  either directly or through their medicaid or managed medicaid programs  have enacted and may further enact healthcare spending cuts or defer cash payments to healthcare providers to avoid raising taxes during periods of economic weakness 
the american recovery and reinvestment act enacted in set aside approximately billion to provide additional medicaid funding to states in the form of a temporary increase in the federal medical assistance percentage fmap until december in august  the additional fmap assistance was extended until june  with a transitional phase out to occur from january  to june  absent significant improvement in economic conditions  we expect that many of the states in which we operate will encounter additional budgetary issues now that the additional fmap funding has expired and  similar as described below with respect to arizona and texas  may choose to reduce medicaid reimbursements or limit eligibility for medicaid coverage  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
during the fiscal year ended june   medicaid and managed medicaid programs accounted for approximately of our net patient revenues 
managed care payers also face economic pressures during periods of economic weakness due to lower enrollment resulting from higher unemployment rates and the inability of individuals to afford private insurance coverage 
these payers may respond to these challenges by reducing or limiting increases to healthcare provider reimbursement rates or reducing benefits to enrollees 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized approximately of our net patient revenues from managed care payers 
in recent years  both the medicare program and several large managed care companies have changed our reimbursement to link some of their payments  especially their annual increases in payments  to performance on certain quality of care measures 
we expect this trend to pay for performance to increase in the future 
summarized below  are a few of the key updates to governmental and managed care reimbursements as they pertain to us 
arizona reimbursement on march   the governor of arizona announced the state s plan to reform medicaid by making changes to eligibility  freezing enrollment  and modifying reimbursement rates  among other proposals 
many of the proposed changes required federal approval 
in april  the governor signed arizona s fiscal year budget legislation  which included a reduction to provider reimbursement  effective october   and a reduction in medicaid beneficiaries through enrollment caps  attrition and more stringent eligibility requirements 
following the passage of the legislation  on october   cms approved certain modifications to arizona s waiver  consistent with the legislative plans 
the ahh challenged the reimbursement cut  but the us district court for the district of arizona declined to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the rate decrease and ahh voluntarily dismissed its claims on april  for a five year period  the waiver allows arizona to freeze medicaid enrollment for certain programs and provides flexibility for the state to fund other programs based on availability of resources 
however  cms did not approve arizona s waiver proposal to freeze enrollment of parents with incomes between of the fpl 
in april  cms approved a modification to arizona s waiver that provides additional funding to certain safety net hospitals and temporarily expands medicaid eligibility for low income children 
in april  cms also approved arizona s state plan amendment  which imposes a day limit per year on inpatient hospital services for adults and older  retroactive to october  additionally  ahcccs has proposed a gain sharing plan  the details of which have not been finalized  which would be implemented through an annual reconciliation process with the managed medicaid health plans 
in july of  cms approved further modifications to arizona s waiver that revised the state s medicaid dsh payment methodology 
texas reimbursement similar to the arizona reimbursement cuts  in july  the texas health and human services commission hhsc issued a final rule implementing a statewide acute care hospital inpatient standard dollar amount sda rate along with an reduction in medicaid hospital outpatient reimbursement 
the ms drg relative weights were also rebased concurrent with the sda rate change 
in june  hhsc submitted a proposed regulation to transition from the use of ms drgs to the all 
table of contents patient refined diagnosis related groups 
after holding a public hearing on july  and receiving written comments on the proposed regulation  hhsc has indicated that it intends to issue a revised final regulation  which will be effective september  the sda rate includes certain add on adjustments for geographic wage index  indirect medical education and trauma services but does not include add on adjustments for higher acuity services such as neonatal and other women s services 
the june proposed rule would remove the cost of living index calculation for the statewide base sda 
our texas hospitals participate in private supplemental medicaid reimbursement programs that are structured to expand the community safety net by providing indigent healthcare services and result in additional revenues for participating hospitals 
cms approved a medicaid waiver in december that allows texas to continue receiving supplemental medicaid reimbursement while expanding its managed medicaid program 
the texas hhsc issued a final rule  effective july   which implements the provider eligibility requirements and payment methodologies approved by cms under the waiver 
the method by which the bexar county  texas supplemental medicaid reimbursement programs will be administered  effective for periods subsequent to july   will be different from the historical method of administration 
this change may result in decreased reimbursement to our san antonio hospitals under these programs 
for the year ended june   our san antonio hospitals recognized approximately million in net patient service revenues and incurred million of expenses related to these programs 
while we currently do not expect these changes to significantly impact these reimbursement programs for the counties served by our valley baptist hospitals  we cannot be certain that these reimbursements will not also be negatively impacted 
from the date of acquisition september  through june   we recognized million of net patient service revenues and incurred million of expenses related to these programs at our valley baptist hospitals 
hhsc proposed regulations to change the methodology for calculating and distributing state medicaid dsh reimbursements effective july   but declined to implement the new regulations after public comment 
however  hhsc did issue a final rule revising the methodology for hospital specific payment limits which is tied to medicaid dsh reimbursement  effective as of july  the impact of this methodology change could significantly reduce the amount of state medicaid dsh reimbursements we receive in texas for our fiscal year ending june  during fiscal  we recognized million of texas medicaid dsh revenues 
of this amount  million was recorded as receivables from the state of texas for combined medicaid dsh and the texas upper payment limit and community safety net programs as of june  recent massachusetts legislation on august   the governor of massachusetts signed comprehensive healthcare payment reform legislation  an act improving the quality of health care and reducing costs through increased transparency  efficiency and innovation 
this legislation is estimated to reduce healthcare costs in massachusetts by as much as billion over the next years through many provider specific and systemic changes 
among these changes are provisions requiring adoption of new payment methodologies by state funded healthcare programs  public reporting of healthcare provider cost and quality measures  monitoring of price variation among healthcare providers and enforcement of healthcare cost growth benchmarks 
we are unable to predict the effect of this legislation on our revenue and operations 
rural floor provision the balanced budget act of bba established a rural floor provision  by which an urban hospital s wage index within a particular state could not be lower than the statewide rural wage index 
the wage index reflects the relative hospital wage level compared to the applicable average hospital wage level 
bba also made this provision budget neutral  meaning that total wage index payments nationwide before and after the implementation of this provision must remain the same 
to accomplish this  cms was required to increase the wage index for all affected urban hospitals and to then calculate a rural floor budget neutrality adjustment rfbna to reduce other wage indexes in order to maintain the same level of payments 
litigation had been pending for several years contending that cms had miscalculated the rfbna since the related litigation was settled in april as a result of the settlement  we received additional medicare payments of approximately million during june this amount was recorded as additional revenues during the fiscal year ended june  estimated direct related expenses of approximately million were recorded during the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents ssi update during march  cms issued new supplemental security income ssi ratios used for calculating medicare dsh reimbursement for ffys ending september  through september  as a result of these new ssi ratios  hospitals must recalculate their medicare dsh reimbursement for the affected years and record adjustments for any differences in estimated reimbursement as a part of their annual cost report settlement process 
historically  cms issued each hospital its ssi ratio annually  several months after the end of each fiscal year 
however  cms delayed issuing final ssi ratios for years after ffy likely due to a court case challenging the government s computation of ssi ratios 
this challenge  which began in  was resolved in the us circuit court of appeals late last year 
pending cms s issuance of new ssi ratios for ffy forward  we had utilized the ssi ratios that were most recently provided by cms in filing our hospital cost reports 
the cumulative impact of this updated medicare reimbursement estimate was an increase in revenues of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  premium revenues we recognize premium revenues from our four health plans  php  aahp  chs and vbic 
premium revenues from these plans decreased million  or  during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  php s average membership decreased to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  php s decrease in revenues resulted from two reimbursement rate reductions by ahcccs implemented as a reduction in april and a reduction in november retroactive to october  and changes made by ahcccs effective october  to limit health plan profitability for the remaining enrollee groups not previously subject to settlement 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other available information  the results of which form the basis of the estimates and assumptions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical because they involve highly subjective and complex assumptions and assessments  are subject to a great degree of fluctuation period over period and are the most critical to our operating performance revenues  revenue deductions and uncompensated care  insurance reserves  health plan claims reserves  income taxes  and long lived assets and goodwill 
revenues  revenue deductions and uncompensated care we recognize patient service revenues during the period the healthcare services are provided based upon estimated amounts due from payers 
we record contractual adjustments to our gross charges to reflect expected reimbursement negotiated with or prescribed by third party payers 
we estimate contractual adjustments and allowances based upon payment terms set forth in managed care health plan contracts and by federal and state regulations 
for the majority of our patient service revenues  we apply contractual adjustments to patient accounts at the time of billing using specific payer contract terms entered into the accounts receivable systems  but in some cases we record an estimated allowance until payment is received 
if our estimated contractual adjustments as a percentage of gross revenues were higher for all insured accounts  our patient service revenues would have been reduced by approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
we derive most of our patient service revenues from healthcare services provided to patients with medicare including managed medicare plans or managed care insurance coverage 

table of contents services provided to medicare patients are generally reimbursed at prospectively determined rates per diagnosis  while services provided to managed care patients are generally reimbursed based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or discounted fee for service rates 
medicaid reimbursements vary by state 
other than medicare  no individual payer represented more than of our patient service revenues 
medicare regulations and many of our managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our healthcare facilities 
to obtain reimbursement for certain services under the medicare program  we must submit annual cost reports and record estimates of amounts owed to or receivable from medicare 
these cost reports include complex calculations and estimates related to indirect medical education  disproportionate share payments  reimbursable medicare bad debts and other items that are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from recorded estimates 
we estimate amounts owed to or receivable from the medicare program using the best information available and our interpretation of the applicable medicare regulations 
we include differences between original estimates and subsequent revisions to those estimates including final cost report settlements in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the revisions are made 
net adjustments for final third party settlements increased patient service revenues and income from continuing operations before income taxes by million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
additionally  updated regulations and contract negotiations with payers occur frequently  which necessitates continual review of revenue estimation processes by management 
we believe that future adjustments to our current third party settlement estimates will not materially impact our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we do not pursue collection of amounts due from uninsured patients that qualify for charity care under our guidelines currently those uninsured patients whose incomes are equal to or less than of the current federal poverty guidelines set forth by the hhs 
we deduct charity care accounts from revenues when we determine that the account meets our charity care guidelines 
we also generally provide discounts from billed charges and alternative payment structures for uninsured patients who do not qualify for charity care  but meet certain other minimum income guidelines  primarily those uninsured patients with incomes between and of the federal poverty guidelines 
during fiscal year  a significant percentage of our charity care deductions represented services provided to undocumented aliens under the section border funding reimbursement program 
border funding qualification ended in texas during our fiscal year and ended in illinois during our fiscal year  and qualification will end during our fiscal year in arizona 
in the ordinary course of business  we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for hospital care 
we include charity care as a revenue deduction measured by the value of our services  based on standard charges  to patients who qualify under our charity care policy and do not otherwise qualify for reimbursement under a governmental program 
the estimated cost incurred by us to provide these services to patients who are unable to pay was approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the estimated cost of charity care services was determined using a ratio of cost to gross charges determined from our most recently filed medicare cost reports and applying that ratio to the gross charges associated with providing charity care for the period 
we record revenues related to the provider tax assessment programs  such as those in illinois and michigan  when the receipt of payment from the state entity is assured 
for the texas upper payment limit upl program  we recognize revenues that offset the expenses associated with the provision of charity care when the services are provided 
we recognize federal match revenues under the texas upl program when payments are assured 
our ability to collect the self pay portions of our receivables is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately and of accounts receivable  net of contractual discounts  as of june  and  respectively 
the primary collection risk relates to uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which primary insurance has paid but patient deductibles or co insurance portions remain outstanding 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a standard policy that reserves all accounts aged greater than days subsequent to discharge date plus percentages of uninsured accounts and self pay after insurance accounts less than days old 
we test our allowance for doubtful accounts policy quarterly using a hindsight calculation that utilizes write off data for all payer classes during the previous month period to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts at a point in time 
we also supplement our analysis by comparing cash collections to net patient revenues and monitoring self pay utilization 
we adjust the standard percentages in our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy as necessary given changes in trends from these analyses or policy changes 
if our uninsured accounts receivable as of june  and were higher  our provision for doubtful accounts would have increased by million and million  respectively 
significant changes in payer mix  business office operations  general economic conditions and healthcare coverage provided by federal or state 
table of contents governments or private insurers may have a significant impact on our estimates and significantly affect our liquidity  results of operations and cash flows 
many of our hospitals have an uninsured discount policy whereby uninsured accounts including those pending medicaid qualification that do not qualify for charity care receive the standard uninsured discount 
the balance of these accounts is subject to our allowance for doubtful accounts policy 
for those accounts that subsequently qualify for medicaid coverage  the uninsured discount is reversed and the account is reclassified to medicaid accounts receivable with the appropriate contractual discount applied 
thus  the contractual allowance for medicaid pending accounts is no longer necessary for those accounts subject to the uninsured discount policy 
medicaid pending accounts receivable was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
because we require patient verification of coverage at the time of admission  reclassifications of medicare or managed care accounts to self pay  other than patient coinsurance or deductible amounts  occur infrequently and are not material to our financial statements 
additionally  the impact of these classification changes is further limited by our ability to identify any necessary classification changes prior to patient discharge or soon thereafter 
due to information system limitations  we are unable to quantify patient deductible and co insurance receivables that are included in the primary payer classification in the accounts receivable aging report at any given point in time 
when classification changes occur  the account balance remains aged from the patient discharge date 
we receive premiums from private  state and federal agencies for members that are assigned to  or have selected  us to provide healthcare services under applicable contracts 
the premiums we receive for each member vary according to the specific contract and are generally determined at the beginning of each contract period 
the premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the terms of the respective contracts  although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract renewal period 
we earned premium revenues of million  million and million during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  from our health plans 
our health plans have agreements with ahcccs  cms and various health maintenance organizations or employers to contract to provide medical services to subscribing participants 
under these agreements  our health plans receive monthly payments based on the number and coverage type of members 
our health plans recognize the payments as revenues in the month in which members are entitled to healthcare services with the exception of aahp medicare part d reinsurance premiums and low income subsidy cost sharing premiums that are recorded as a liability to fund future healthcare costs or else repaid to cms 
insurance reserves we have self insured medical plans that cover all of our employees 
claims are accrued under the self insured plans as the incidents that gave rise to them occur 
unpaid claims accruals are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settlement  including claim settlement expenses  in accordance with an average lag time and historical experience 
due to the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to professional and general liability and workers compensation claims and related lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
we maintain professional and general liability insurance with unrelated commercial insurance carriers to provide for losses up to million in excess of our self insured retention such self insured retention maintained through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries and or other of our subsidiaries of million through june  but increased to million for the illinois hospitals subsequent to june  effective with the acquisition of dmc on january   we also provide professional and general liability coverage to certain non employed physicians in michigan through another of our captive insurance subsidiaries 
through the period ended june   we insured our excess professional and general liability coverage under a retrospectively rated policy  and premiums under this policy were recorded at the minimum premium 
we self insure our workers compensation claims ranging from million to million per claim and purchase excess insurance coverage for claims exceeding the self insured limits 
our professional and general liability reserve as of june  was million and was comprised of estimated indemnity payments and related loss adjustment expenses related to reported events case reserves  estimated indemnity payments related to incurred but not reported events ibnr  and estimated unallocated loss adjustment expenses representing an estimate of the administrative costs necessary to resolve outstanding claims  all on an undiscounted basis 
our accounting policy is to include estimates of case reserves  ibnr and unallocated loss adjustment expenses in our professional 
table of contents and general liability reserve 
the ibnr portion of the reserve includes an estimate of losses expected to be covered by our excess insurance policies of approximately million at june  we also had a receivable of approximately million at june  for the expected reimbursement of these estimated excess coverage losses from third party insurance companies  reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we enter into excess or reinsurance policies with insurance carriers whose financial strength ratings are a or greater  as issued by a 
m 
best company  a credit rating organization that specializes in the insurance industry 
we believe any recorded excess receivables from such insurance carriers would be collectible at such time that a reported event reached an excess layer 
management uses information from our risk management incident reporting system  which contains claim specific information obtained from our risk managers and external attorneys who review the claims  to estimate the appropriate case reserves based upon case specific facts and circumstances 
case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are increased or decreased as management s estimates regarding the expected amounts of future losses are revised based upon new information received about the incidents or developments in the cases 
once case reserves are finalized for a particular assessment period  incurred and paid loss information is stratified by coverage layers  accident years  reported years and the states in which our hospitals operate 
due to the significant variation in types of medical situations underlying the claims  the geographic jurisdiction of the claims and other claim specific circumstances  we do not stratify claims data into any further homogenous groups 
our historical loss information  which includes actual claims payments and estimated remaining case reserves for all claims since the our inception in  is utilized to help develop ibnr estimates on a semi annual basis along with industry data 
we consistently apply our processes for obtaining and analyzing loss data for our hospitals 
we quickly integrate these same processes with respect to any hospitals we acquire 
we estimate the average time between the claim incurred date and the claim settlement date to be approximately four to five years  but claims may be settled more or less quickly than this average based upon the claim specific circumstances and the jurisdiction of the case 
many reported events or claims included in our loss history never result in a payment by us and are closed much more quickly than this average 
we generally pay settled claims less than days after a settlement is reached  which results in our settled claims liability being less than of our total professional and general liability reserve 
we use an actuary to assist us in the ibnr estimation process and the actuary s conclusions serve as the basis for our periodic ibnr assessments 
our actuary applies multiple actuarial methods to our loss data to develop the best estimate of ibnr 
these actuarial methods consider a combination of our actual historical losses and projected industry based losses in differing weights for each policy period  estimates of unreported claims and adverse development for reported claims and the frequency  severity and lag time to resolve claims 
the ibnr analysis also considers actual and projected hospital statistical and census data  the number and risk based ratings for covered physicians  retention levels for each policy period  tort reform legislation within each state in which we operate and other factors 
the development of professional and general liability reserve estimates includes multiple judgments and assumptions  including the significant amount of time between the occurrence giving rise to the claim and the ultimate resolution of the claim the tail period  the severity of individual claims based upon circumstances specific to each claim  determinations of the appropriate weighting of company specific and industry data  projections of adverse developments on reported claims  and differences between actual and expected judicial outcomes 
while we believe our rigorous and consistent risk management processes and industry knowledge  our extensive historical claims experience  and actuarial reports enable us to reliably estimate our professional and general liability reserves  events may occur that could materially change our current estimates 
the following tables summarize our employee health  professional and general liability and workers compensation reserve balances including the current portions of such reserves as of june    and and claims loss and claims payment information during the years ended june   and in millions

table of contents health plan claims reserves during the fiscal years ended june   and  health plan claims expense was million  million and million  respectively  primarily representing medical claims of php 
we estimate php s reserve for medical claims using historical claims experience including cost per member and payment lag time and other actuarial data including number of members and certain member demographic information 
the following table provides the health plan reserve balances as of june   and and health plan claims and payment information during the fiscal years ended june   and in millions 
year ended june  health plan reserves and settlements  beginning of year acquired health plan reserves current year provision for health plan claims current year adjustments to prior year health plan claims program settlement  capitation and other activity claims paid related to current year claims paid related to prior years health plan reserves and settlements  end of year the increases in reserves  claims losses and claims payments from to was primarily due to the increase in php members during the period 
the decrease in these amounts from to primarily related to decreases in php members as a result of ahcccs eligibility restrictions put in place beginning october  health plan claims expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of costs incurred but not yet paid 
accrued health plans claims and settlements on our consolidated balance sheet includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet received or adjudicated and claims adjudicated but not yet paid  estimated unallocated loss adjustment expenses representing an estimate of the administrative costs necessary to resolve outstanding claims  and certain amounts receivable from or payable to ahcccs or cms for the settlement of actual claims incurred compared to interim payments received related to member groups for which profitability or the risk of loss is limited 
accrued health plan claims and settlements do not include a reserve for adverse deviation 
as of june  and  net settlements payable to ahcccs or cms were million and million  respectively 
we estimate accrued health claims by analyzing claims payment information from a claims triangle model that compares the incurred date for claims to the payment date for those claims 
we then calculate per member per month health plan claims costs based upon claims payments for historical periods divided by the number of members during that period 
completion factors are then applied to this estimate to determine the total accrual estimate 
we assess the appropriateness of this methodology by comparing our estimates to those of an independent external actuary and also by reviewing ultimate claims payments for certain prior year periods and analyzing utilization trends to determine if adjustments need to be made to the estimation methodology 
any change in the amount of incurred claims related to prior years included in the health plan claims reserve does not directly correspond to a change in our statement of operations due to the reconciliation and settlement provisions included in certain reconciled member groups 
while management believes that its estimation methodology effectively captures trends in medical claims costs  actual payments could differ significantly from its estimates given changes in the healthcare cost structure or adverse experience 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of accrued and paid claims for services provided to our health plan members by our hospitals and our other healthcare facilities were eliminated in consolidation 
our operating results and cash flows could be materially affected by increased or decreased utilization of our healthcare facilities by members in our health plans 
income taxes we believe that our income tax provisions are accurate and supportable  but certain tax matters require interpretations of tax law that may be subject to future challenge and may not be upheld under tax audit 
to reflect the possibility that all of our tax positions may not be sustained  we maintain tax reserves that are subject to adjustment as updated information becomes available or as circumstances change 
we record the impact of tax reserve changes to our income tax provision in the period in which the additional information  including the progress of tax audits  is obtained 

table of contents we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the factors used in this determination include the following cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  availability  or lack thereof  of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits  carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in addition  financial forecasts used in determining the need for  or amount of  federal and state valuation allowances are subject to changes in underlying assumptions and fluctuations in market conditions that could significantly alter our recoverability analysis and thus have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
effective july   we adopted the relevant guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the following table provides a detailed rollforward of our net liability for uncertain tax positions for each of the fiscal years ended june   and in millions 
balance at june  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions of prior years reductions for tax positions of prior years settlements balance at june  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions of prior years reductions for tax positions of prior years settlements balance at june  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions of prior years reductions for tax positions of prior years settlements balance at june  the provisions set forth in accounting for uncertain tax positions allow for the classification of interest on an underpayment of income taxes  when the tax law requires interest to be paid  and penalties  when a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties  in income taxes  interest expense or another appropriate expense classification based on the accounting policy election of the entity 
we elected to continue our historical practice of classifying interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
of the million total unrecognized tax benefits  as of june   million of this balance would impact the effective tax rate if recognized 
long lived assets and goodwill goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances 
goodwill is tested for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
in assessing goodwill for impairment  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment review process is unnecessary 
however  if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment  then we are required to perform the first 
table of contents step of the two step impairment review process 
in  we elected not to perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill 
the first step of the two step process involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
in performing the first step  we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the significant judgments are typically based upon level inputs  generally defined as unobservable inputs representing our own assumptions 
the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and  when applicable  various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business plan period 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our annual impairment analysis did not result in any impairments of our goodwill 
however  our arizona hospitals reporting unit experienced market challenges that negatively impacted its results of operations and cash flows during the fiscal year ended june  these factors included hospital reimbursement cuts  reductions to covered lives under the state s ahcccs program and local economic conditions that adversely impacted elective volumes for these hospitals 
based upon the implementation of certain cost reduction initiatives  expected improvements in the local economic and state financial conditions and the demographic composition of this market  we believe future operating results and cash flows of these hospitals will improve 
however  we will continue to monitor the operating results of these hospitals and other market environmental factors to determine if further impairment considerations are necessary with respect to the million of goodwill for this reporting unit 
during the first half of fiscal  we re assessed the operating results of our then existing illinois facilities and concluded that it was unlikely that previously projected cash flows for these hospitals would be achieved 
we performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended december  and  based upon revised projected cash flows  market participant data and appraisal information  we determined that the million remaining goodwill related to this reporting unit was impaired 
the million million  net of taxes non cash impairment loss is included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june

table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  acute care services on a consolidated basis 
net patient service revenues increased  million  or  during the current year compared to the prior year 
the significant increase in net patient service revenues is primarily the result of recent acquisitions  including dmc on january  and valley baptist on september   in addition to updates to medicare reimbursement estimates related to rural floor settlement and ssi ratio updates during the current year 
our percentage of uncompensated care defined as the sum of uninsured discounts  charity care adjustments and the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net patient revenues prior to these uncompensated care deductions increased to during the current year compared to during the prior year 
this increase primarily resulted from an increase in self pay discharges as a percentage of total discharges during the current year and price increases implemented since the prior year

effective october   ahcccs reduced medicaid eligibility and coverage for certain member categories 
php s average membership decreased by during the current year compared to the prior year 
additionally  revenues were lower during the current year as a result of two reimbursement rate reductions implemented by ahcccs in april and november retroactive to october   and limitations to health plan profitability for member groups not previously subject to settlement

table of contents continue to be significantly impacted by the acquisitions during our and fiscal years  as previously discussed 
salaries and benefits  health plan claims and supplies represent the most significant of our normal costs and expenses and those typically subject to the greatest level of fluctuation year over year 
salaries and benefits 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of total revenues increased to during the current year compared to for the prior year primarily due to the decrease in health plan premium revenues for which salaries and benefits are not as significant as for acute care services 
on a same store basis  salaries and benefits as a percentage of total revenues was during the current year compared to for the prior year 
we continue to employ more physicians to support the communities our hospitals serve and have made significant investments in clinical quality initiatives that required additional human resources during the current year

as of june   we had approximately  full time and part time employees compared to approximately  as of june  on a same store basis  including corporate and regional employees  the number of full time and part time employees remained flat when compared to the prior year 
we have been successful in limiting contract labor utilization as a result of our investments in clinical quality and nurse leadership initiatives 
on a same store basis  our contract labor expense as a percentage of net patient service revenues slightly declined to for the current year compared to for the prior year 
health plan claims 
health plan claims expense as a percentage of premium revenues decreased to during the current year compared to during the prior year 
as enrollment increases  this ratio becomes increasingly sensitive to the mix of members  including covered groups based upon age and gender and county of residence 
eligibility restrictions implemented by ahcccs resulted in reductions to enrolled members that utilized more healthcare services than the php members in general 
regulators also implemented limits on profitability for certain member groups during the prior contract year  which negatively impacted this ratio 
in addition  the decreased php revenues magnified the impact of the third party administrator revenues at chs that have no corresponding health plan claims expense 
revenues and expenses between the health plans and our hospitals and related outpatient service providers of approximately million  or of gross health plan claims expense  were eliminated in consolidation during the current year 
supplies 
supplies as a percentage of acute care services segment revenues decreased to during the current year compared to during the prior year 
this ratio was positively impacted by the continued reduction in same store surgeries between the current and prior years 
we continued our focus on supply chain efficiencies  including reduction in physician commodity variation and improved pharmacy formulary management  during the current year 
our ability to reduce this ratio in future years may be limited because our growth strategies include expansion of higher acuity services and due to inflationary pressures on medical supplies and pharmaceuticals 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include  among others  purchased services  insurance  non income taxes  rents and leases  repairs and maintenance and utilities 
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to during the current year compared to during the prior year primarily as a result of increased purchased services related to our fiscal and acquisitions 
other 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  year over year as a result of our capital improvement and expansion initiatives and the dmc and valley baptist acquisitions 
net interest increased by million  or  year over year as a result of the issuance of the new notes in march and the full year impact of our note offerings in january and july we incurred million of acquisition related expenses during the current year and million of acquisition related expenses during the prior year 
we also incurred million of restructuring charges during the prior year related to the elimination of approximately positions for the realignment of certain corporate services 
the prior year measure was negatively impacted by the approximately million in monitoring fees and expenses that include the termination of a transaction and monitoring agreement with our equity sponsors 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately during the current year 
this rate was lower than expected due to a combination of changes to state tax laws in michigan and adjustments to state deferred tax asset valuation allowances on loss carryforwards in other states during the fourth quarter of fiscal combined with a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to success based transaction costs during the third quarter of fiscal the effective income tax rate during the prior year resulted from the non deductibility of certain components of monitoring fees and expenses and an increase in the valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carryforwards

income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately during the year ended june  compared to during the prior year 
the effective rate was higher during fiscal due to the non deductibility of certain components of monitoring fees and expenses and an increase in the valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carryforwards

investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decreased from million during the fiscal year ended june  to million during the fiscal year ended june   primarily as a result of less cash paid for acquisitions

table of contents financing activities cash flows from financing activities decreased by  million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  primarily due to the redemption of senior discount notes during the current year with proceeds from our initial public offering received during the prior year 
we also issued additional notes during the prior year and recorded net proceeds from our initial public offering in june of million 
in march  we issued an additional million principal amount of senior notes million in cash proceeds net of original issue discount at an offering price of plus accrued interest from february  we used a portion of the proceeds to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility on march in july and august  we redeemed approximately million of the senior discount notes using proceeds from our initial public offering  including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
we recorded debt extinguishment costs of million  million net of taxes  representing tender premiums and other costs to redeem the senior discount notes and the write off of net deferred loan costs associated with the redeemed senior discount notes 
during the fiscal year ended june   we redeemed approximately million of the remaining senior discount notes through privately negotiated transactions 
the accreted value of the remaining outstanding senior discount notes was approximately million as of june  as of june   our outstanding debt was  million  and we had million of remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility following a million increase to the capacity of our revolving facility in may debt covenants our credit facilities contain a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict  subject to certain exceptions  our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  repay other indebtedness including the notes  the senior notes and senior discount notes  pay certain dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock  create liens on assets  make investments  loans or advances  make certain acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  create a healthcare joint venture  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  amend certain material agreements governing our indebtedness  including the notes  the senior notes and the senior discount notes  change the business conducted by our subsidiaries  enter into certain hedging agreements  and make capital expenditures above specified levels 
in addition  the credit facilities include a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio 
the following table sets forth the interest coverage and leverage covenant tests as of june  debt covenant ratio actual ratio interest coverage ratio requirement x x total leverage ratio limit x x factors outside our control may make it difficult for us to comply with these covenants during future periods 
these factors include  among others  a prolonged economic recession  a higher number of uninsured or underinsured patients and decreased governmental or managed care payer reimbursement  any or all of which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows and cause us to violate one or more of these covenants 
violation of one or more of the covenants could result in an immediate call of the outstanding principal amount under our term loan facility or the necessity of lender waivers with more onerous terms  including adverse pricing or repayment provisions or more restrictive covenants 
a default under our credit facilities would also result in a default under the indenture governing our notes and the indentures governing the senior notes and senior discount notes 
capital resources we anticipate spending a total of million to million in capital expenditures during fiscal under the terms of the dmc acquisition agreement  we were required to spend at least million on expansion projects set forth in the agreement by december  as part of the million total commitment for specified capital projects 
since we did not meet this commitment  in february  we deposited funds into an escrow account restricted for the purpose of funding capital expenditures related to the specific project list until the escrow is depleted 
as of june   the restricted cash held in escrow for the specific project list was million  however  an additional million and million was released from escrow in july and august  respectively 
the dmc acquisition agreement requires that we spend at least million 
table of contents including the million required to have been spent by december  on capital expenditures related to the specific project list by december   and we will need to escrow any shortfall from this amount prior to mid february as part of the valley baptist acquisition  we issued a redeemable non controlling interest to the seller that enables the seller to require us to redeem all or a portion of its equity interest in the partnership on the third or fifth anniversary of the acquisition date at a stated redemption value 
if the seller exercises this option  we may purchase the non controlling interest with cash or by issuing stock 
it is our intent to settle in cash  if the option is exercised 
these potential cash outflows could limit our ability to fund our other operating needs  including acquisitions or other growth opportunities 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents as of june  we rely on available cash  cash flows generated by operations and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
we believe that we invest our cash in accounts in high quality financial institutions 
we continually explore various options to increase the return on our invested cash while preserving our principal cash balances 
however  the significant majority of our cash and cash equivalents  deposits and investments are not federally insured and could be at risk in the event of a collapse of those financial institutions 
as of june   we held million in total available for sale investments in securities held by one of our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiaries acquired in the dmc acquisition 
we may not be able to utilize these investments to fund our operating or capital expenditure funding needs due to statutory limitations placed on this captive insurance subsidiary 
liquidity outlook due primarily to the dmc capital commitment escrow funding requirement and continued reimbursement delays from certain governmental payers  at various times subsequent to december   we made borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital needs 
in april  we received commitments  which became effective in may  to increase the amount available under our revolving facility from million to million 
we expect that cash on hand  the expanded capacity under our revolving facility  and cash generated from our operations to be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs during the next months and into the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and the capacity under our revolving facility will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs and debt service requirements during the long term 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions  partnership arrangements and service expansion or de novo development opportunities  either in existing markets or new markets  that fit our growth strategies 
these opportunities may require significant additional investment 
we also have significant capital commitments remaining under our dmc purchase agreement to be funded during the next several years 
to finance transactions and our capital commitments or for other general corporate needs  we may increase borrowings under our term loan facility  issue additional senior or subordinated notes  use available cash on hand  utilize amounts available under our revolving facility or seek additional financing  including debt or equity 
as market conditions warrant  we and our major equity holders  including blackstone and its affiliates  may from time to time repurchase debt securities issued by us  in privately negotiated or open market transactions  by tender offer or otherwise 
our future operating performance  ability to service existing debt or opportunities to obtain additional financing on favorable terms may be limited by economic or other market conditions or business factors  many of which are beyond our control

these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
this obligation represents our estimated minimum required funding to the dmc pension plan trust beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year because the future cash outflows are uncertain and subject to change  the timing and amounts of payments to the trust beyond months are not included as of june  for additional information about the dmc pension plan and expected future benefit payments from the trust  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k

guarantees and off balance sheet arrangements we are currently a party to a certain rent shortfall agreement with a certain unconsolidated entity 
we also enter into physician income guarantees and service agreement guarantees and other guarantee arrangements  including parent subsidiary guarantees  in the ordinary course of business 
we have not engaged in any transaction or arrangement with an unconsolidated entity that is reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity 
we had standby letters of credit outstanding of million as of june   which primarily relate to security for the payment of claims as required by various insurance programs 
concurrent with the closing of the dmc transaction  we placed into escrow for the benefit of dmc a warrant certificate representing warrants in respect of  shares of our common stock the warrant shares 
in may  we replaced the warrant shares with a contingent unsecured subordinated promissory note payable to the legacy dmc entity in the original principal amount of million to collateralize our million specified project capital commitment  which replacement was permitted by the asset purchase agreement for the dmc acquisition 
the principal amount of the promissory note is reduced automatically as we expend capital or escrow cash related to this capital commitment 
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal  state and local laws have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
revenues for acute hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal government s prospective payment system 
we believe that hospital industry operating margins have been  and may continue to be  under significant pressure because of changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
as of june   we had in place  million of senior credit facilities bearing interest at variable rates at specified margins above either the agent bank s alternate base rate or the libor rate 
as of june   our credit facilities consisted of million in term loans maturing in january and a million revolving credit facility maturing in january  million of capacity was utilized by outstanding letters of credit letters of credit outstanding were increased to million as of july  
we received commitments  which became effective in may  to increase the borrowing capacity under our revolving facility by million to provide a total capacity of million 
although changes in the alternate base rate or the libor rate would affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future  we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates would not be material to our results of operations or cash flows 
an estimated change in the variable interest rate under our term loan facility would result in a change in annual net interest of approximately million 
borrowings under our revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  the alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from per annum or the libor rate plus a margin ranging from per annum  in each case dependent upon our consolidated leverage ratio 
our million in outstanding term loans bear interest at the alternate base rate plus a rate equal to  at our option  per annum or the libor rate subject to a floor plus a margin of per annum
