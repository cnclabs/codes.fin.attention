item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview idenix pharmaceuticals  inc  which we refer to together with our wholly owned subsidiaries as idenix  we  us or our  is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases with operations in the united states and europe 
currently  our primary research and development focus is on the treatment of patients with hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
our hcv discovery program is focused on nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors and nsa inhibitors 
our strategic goal is to develop all oral combinations of direct acting antiviral  or daa  drug candidates that should eliminate the need for interferon and or ribavirin with the current treatment for hcv 
our objective is to develop low dose  once or twice daily agents with broad genotypic activity that have low potential for drug drug interaction  high tolerability and are designed for use in multiple combination regimens 
we may seek to build a combination development strategy  both internally and with partners  to advance the future of hcv treatments 
we believe that nucleosides nucleotides will have a significant role in a combination daa strategy for the treatment of hcv and therefore we are currently concentrating a substantial amount of our discovery efforts on this class of drugs 
we believe we have strong nucleoside nucleotide scientific expertise within our organization and should be able to leverage our intellectual patent portfolio to develop additional novel nucleoside nucleotide drug candidates 
the following table summarizes key information regarding our pipeline of hcv drug candidates as well as tyzeka sebivo indication product drug candidates programs description hcv nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors idx in the second quarter of  we completed a one month single dose bioavailability study in healthy volunteers of a new tablet formulation of idx using the new formulation  in july of  we initiated the phase iib clinical trial of idx in treatment na ve hcv genotype infected patients under partial clinical hold  which is described in more detail below 
the interim analysis of the first patients following days of treatment from this clinical trial demonstrated that the side effect profile of idx was consistent with that seen with pegylated interferon and ribavirin  or peg ifn rbv  and there were no serious adverse events 
the interim data rapid virologic response  or rvr  findings demonstrated that of patients in the mg idx arm and in the mg arm had undetectable virus iu ml at days 
as of january   of patients in the mg arm and in the mg arm had undetectable virus at a median of weeks of treatment 
we provided an interim analysis of the first patients following days of treatment to an independent data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  and to the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the dsmb reviewed the data for the first patients and recommended the continuation of enrollment in the phase iib idx clinical trial 
we submitted the interim data  along with the dsmb s recommendations  to the fda and requested the continuation of this study and removal of the partial clinical hold for idx in february  the fda removed the partial clinical hold on idx and as a result we can continue enrollment of the phase iib study of idx and evaluate idx in future interferon free combination regimens with other daas 
in addition  the fda allowed us to truncate the phase iib study from patients  as in the original protocol  to a total of patients  and to expand the enrollment criteria as recommended by the dsmb 

table of contents indication product drug candidates programs description nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors idx in  we selected two additional nucleotide polymerase inhibitors  idx and idx  to advance into preclinical testing 
we selected idx as our lead candidate for our next generation nucleotide polymerase inhibitor program and we expect to submit an investigational new drug application  or ind  for this candidate in the middle of we are also evaluating other nucleotide prodrugs in preclinical testing 
nsa inhibitors idx in  we selected idx as our lead candidate for our nsa program 
in preclinical studies  idx has shown potent and pan genotypic activity 
in december  we filed an ind for idx and in january  we initiated a phase i clinical study in healthy volunteers 
we expect to begin a proof of concept study in the second quarter of hbv tyzeka sebivo telbivudine l nucleoside novartis pharma ag  or novartis  has worldwide development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo 
we receive royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
in september  the fda placed two of our hcv drug candidates  idx and idx  on clinical hold 
the hold was imposed due to three serious adverse events of elevated liver function tests that were detected during post drug exposure safety visits following a day drug drug interaction study of a combination of idx and idx in healthy volunteers 
we believe the hepatotoxicity observed in this drug drug interaction study was caused by idx and therefore discontinued the clinical development of this drug candidate 
in february  the full clinical hold on idx was removed 
the program was placed on partial clinical hold  which allowed us to initiate a phase iib week clinical trial of idx in hcv infected patients in july we provided an interim analysis of the first patients following days of treatment to an independent dsmb and to the fda 
the dsmb reviewed the data for the first patients and recommended the continuation of enrollment in the phase iib idx clinical trial 
we submitted the interim data  along with the dsmb s recommendations  to the fda and requested the continuation of this study and removal of the partial clinical hold for idx in february  the fda removed the partial clinical hold on idx and as a result we can continue enrollment of the phase iib study of idx and evaluate idx in future interferon free combination regimens with other daas 
in addition  the fda allowed us to truncate the phase iib study from patients  as in the original protocol  to a total of patients  and to expand the enrollment criteria as recommended by the dsmb 
all of our drug candidates are currently in preclinical or clinical development 
to commercialize any of our drug candidates  we will be required to obtain marketing authorization approvals after successfully completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of such drug candidates 
we anticipate that we will incur significant additional third party research and development expenses that range from million to million for each drug candidate prior to commercial launch 
our current estimates of additional third party research and development expenses do not include the cost of phase iiib iv clinical trials and other clinical trials that are not required for regulatory approval 
we use our employees and our infrastructure resources across several projects  including our product discovery efforts 
we do not allocate our infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the internal costs incurred to date for our drug candidates on a project by project basis 

table of contents set forth below were the third party research and development expenses incurred in connection with our significant preclinical studies and clinical trials disease indication product drug candidate years ended december  in thousands hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitors hcv nsa inhibitors hcv non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor hcv protease inhibitors hcv preclinical discovery program and other hcv combination drug drug interaction study hbv telbivudine tyzeka sebivo hiv non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor as shown in the table above  in  our focus continued to be on the development of our nucleotide polymerase inhibitors program 
during  we completed ind enabling studies for our nsa program and filed an ind in december we elected not to devote significant resources to our non nucleoside and protease inhibitor programs and have reallocated these resources to the discovery and development of additional nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors 
novartis has the option to license our development stage drug candidates after demonstration of activity and safety in a proof of concept clinical trial so long as novartis maintains at least ownership of our common stock pursuant to our development  license and commercialization agreement with novartis  which we refer to as the development and commercialization agreement 
if novartis licenses any of our drug candidates  novartis is obligated to fund development expenses that we incur in accordance with development plans agreed upon by us and novartis 
in october  novartis waived its option to license idx as a result  we retain the worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  commercialize and license idx we may seek a partner who will assist in the future development and commercialization of this drug candidate 
we have incurred significant losses each year since our inception in may and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future discovery and development activities  we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and the expected royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo will be sufficient to sustain operations for at least the next months from december  novartis collaboration in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
in may  novartis also purchased approximately of our common stock 
since this date  novartis has had the ability to exercise control over our strategic direction  research and development activities and other materials business decisions 
we derived the majority of our total revenues from novartis in  and through the recognition of license fees  milestone payments  research and development expense reimbursements and royalty payments 
under the collaboration  novartis paid us million of non refundable payments that have been recorded as deferred revenue 
these deferred payments are being recognized over the development period of the licensed drug candidates  which represents the period of our continuing obligations 
additionally  we also receive royalty payments from novartis based on net sales of tyzeka sebivo 

table of contents we expect to continue to recognize revenue related to novartis associated with the non refundable payments as well as the royalty payments 
we also anticipate recognizing additional revenues from our collaboration with novartis  which may include license fees  development expense funding for our drug candidates that novartis may elect to subsequently license from us  as well as  regulatory milestones and  if products are approved for sale  commercialization milestones and revenues derived from sales  by us or novartis  of our licensed drug candidates 
viiv healthcare company and glaxosmithkline collaboration in february  we licensed our non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  or nnrti  compounds to glaxosmithkline  or gsk 
this agreement  which we refer to as the viiv license agreement  was assigned to viiv healthcare company  or viiv  which is an affiliate of gsk 
the viiv license agreement granted viiv an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  now known as  for the treatment of human diseases  including human immunodeficiency virus type  or hiv  and acquired immune deficiency syndrome  or aids 
in february  we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with gsk  which we refer to as the gsk stock purchase agreement 
under this agreement  gsk purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million  or a per share price of 
these agreements became effective in march in march  we received a million payment related to this agreement  which consisted of a million license fee payment under the viiv license agreement and the million under the gsk stock purchase agreement described above 
in  we received a million milestone payment for the achievement of a preclinical operational milestone and a million milestone payment for the initiation of a phase iib clinical study of in february  viiv informed us that the fda placed on clinical hold 
as a result of further evaluation  viiv determined that it would not continue development of or develop any other compound licensed under the viiv license agreement 
in december  viiv notified us that it would terminate the viiv license agreement effective march  upon termination  we will have no future obligations pursuant to the license agreement and the deferred revenue balance of million at december  associated with the viiv license agreement is expected to be recognized as other collaboration revenue in the first quarter of results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue related party license fee revenue royalty revenue other revenue collaboration revenue government grants total revenues 
table of contents collaboration revenue related party consisted of revenue associated with our collaboration with novartis for the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
during the years ended december   and  collaboration revenue related party was comprised of the following license and other fees received from novartis for the license of hepatitis b virus  or hbv  and hcv drug candidates  net of reductions for novartis stock subscription rights  which is being recognized over the development period of our licensed drug candidates  royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo made by novartis  and reimbursement by novartis for expenses we incurred in connection with the development and registration of our licensed products and drug candidates  net of certain qualifying costs incurred by novartis 
collaboration revenue related party was million in as compared to million in the million decrease in license fee revenue was primarily due to million related to the impact of novartis stock subscription rights and million due to adjusting the expected development period of our licensed drug candidates in  which represents the period over which we recognize license fee revenue 
collaboration revenue recognized under the viiv license agreement was million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to the recognition of additional revenue in related to the million milestone payments received under the viiv license agreement 
a cumulative catch up of million was recognized in related to these milestone payments 
there were no milestone payments received during in december  viiv notified us they were terminating the license agreement effective march  upon termination  we will have no future obligations pursuant to the license agreement and the deferred revenue balance of million at december  associated with the viiv license agreement is expected to be recognized as other collaboration revenue in the first quarter of cost of revenues cost of revenues were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily a result of lower royalty payments due by us to a third party in in  we paid royalties to a third party associated with the million milestone payments received under the viiv license agreement in there were no milestone payments received in research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to million of lower expenses related to devoting fewer resources to our protease inhibitor and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor programs in in addition  salaries and personnel related costs decreased million in compared to mainly due to a reduced headcount 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in expenses related to our nsa program 
we expect our research and development expenses for to be higher than the amount incurred in mainly due to the continued development of idx and to the advancement of our other hcv drug candidates into clinical testing in we may seek a partner that will assist in the further development and commercialization of idx  which would reduce future costs associated with idx we will continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities  expand our research pipeline and engage in future development activities as we continue to advance our drug candidates and explore collaborations with other entities that we believe will create shareholder value 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to million of severance and share based compensation expense related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer in  for which there is no comparable expense in we expect general and administrative expenses in to be consistent with the expenses incurred in restructuring charges in  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance costs related to the restructuring of our montpellier facility together with charges related to an earlier reduction of our united states workforce 
all significant severance amounts were paid in there were no restructuring charges recorded in other income  net other income  net was million in which was substantially unchanged as compared to income tax benefit expense income tax benefit was less than million in which was substantially unchanged as compared to comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue related party license fee revenue royalty revenue reimbursement of research and development costs other revenue collaboration revenue

collaboration revenue recognized under the viiv license agreement was million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to the recognition of additional revenue related to the million and million milestone payments received under the viiv license agreement in a cumulative catch up of million was recognized related to the million milestone payments received in 
table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily a result of higher royalty payments due by us to a third party related to the million and million milestone payments received under the viiv license agreement in research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to million of additional expenses in for a phase iia clinical trial of idx  which was initiated in the fourth quarter of  the phase i and proof of concept clinical studies of idx and a combination drug drug interaction study of idx and idx  which were initiated in these costs were offset by million in lower salaries and personnel related costs  mainly related to reduced headcount as a result of the restructurings in the united states and europe 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to million of severance expense and share based compensation expense related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer in october these costs were offset by million lower consulting fees  salaries and personnel related costs  mainly related to reduced headcount as a result of the restructuring in the united states 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in as compared to million in during the first quarter of  we initiated a plan to restructure our operations at our research facility in montpellier  france to reduce its workforce by approximately positions in connection with our ongoing cost saving initiatives 
in the first quarter of  we recorded charges of million for employee severance costs related to the restructuring of our montpellier facility together with charges related to an earlier reduction of our united states workforce by positions in january all significant severance amounts were paid in in june  we closed our lab facility in cagliari  italy and eliminated employee positions as a result of continuing cost saving initiatives

there was no remaining amount accrued related to this restructuring as of december  other income  net other income  net was million in which was substantially unchanged as compared to income tax benefit expense income tax benefit was less than million in which was substantially unchanged as compared to liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations with proceeds obtained in connection with license and development arrangements and equity financings 
the proceeds include license  milestone  royalty and other payments from novartis  license  milestone and stock purchase payments from viiv and gsk  
table of contents reimbursements from novartis for costs we have incurred subsequent to may  in connection with the development of tyzeka sebivo  valtorcitabine and valopicitabine  sales of tyzeka in the united states through september   net proceeds from sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd  or sumitomo  for reimbursement of development costs  net proceeds from private placements of our convertible preferred stock in  and  net proceeds from public or underwritten offerings in july  october  august  april  april and november  net proceeds from private placements of our common stock concurrent with our  and april public offerings  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted pursuant to our equity compensation plans 
any financing requiring the issuance of additional shares of capital stock must first be approved by novartis for so long as novartis continues to own at least of our voting stock 
we received novartis approval for the following offerings in  and in may  we received approval from novartis to issue capital shares pursuant to financing transactions under a shelf registration statement filed in september with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  so long as the issuance of shares did not reduce novartis interest in idenix below 
in august  we issued approximately million shares pursuant to an underwritten offering and received million in net proceeds 
additionally  pursuant to this shelf registration statement  in april  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering and received million in net proceeds 
novartis did not participate in these offerings  in april  we received approval from novartis to issue capital shares so long as the issuance of shares did not reduce novartis interest in idenix below 
in april  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to the september shelf registration statement and approximately million shares of our common stock to novartis pursuant to a private placement agreement 
the net proceeds of both transactions were million 
upon completion of this offering  we fully utilized the shelf registration statement and novartis owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in conjunction with the issuance of common stock in april  we amended the collaboration with novartis to provide that a novartis retains the exclusive option to obtain rights to drug candidates developed by us so long as novartis maintains ownership of at least of our common stock  rather than ownership of at least as was the case prior to the amendment  b we will use reasonable best efforts to nominate for election as directors at least two designees of novartis so long as novartis maintains ownership of at least of our common stock  rather than ownership of at least as was the case prior to the amendment  and c novartis consent is required for the selection and appointment of our chief financial officer so long as novartis owns at least of our common stock  rather than ownership of at least as was the case prior to the amendment  and in november  we received approval from novartis to issue capital shares so long as the issuance of shares did not reduce novartis interest in idenix below 
in october  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec which will allow us to offer and sell from time to time up to a maximum of million of shares of common stock  at prices and terms to be determined at the time of sale 
pursuant to this shelf registration statement  in november  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering and received million in net proceeds 
novartis did not participate in this offering 

table of contents we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses over the next several years as we continue to expand our drug discovery and development efforts 
as a result  we may seek additional funding through a combination of public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements and we may seek a partner who will assist in the future development and commercialization of idx as previously noted  any financing requiring the issuance of additional shares of capital stock must first be approved by novartis so long as novartis continues to own at least of our voting stock 
as of february   novartis owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
additional funding may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  other than novartis  which has the right to maintain its current ownership level 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and the expected royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo will be sufficient to sustain operations for at least the next months from december  if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis  we could be required to delay  reduce or eliminate one or more of our drug development programs  enter into new collaborative  strategic alliances or licensing arrangements that may not be favorable to us and reduce the number of our employees 
more generally  if we are unable to obtain adequate funding  we may be required to scale back  suspend or terminate our business operations 
we had total cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 
as of december   all of our investments were in government agency and treasury money market instruments 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities of million in compared to was primarily due to the receipt of million in milestone payments under the viiv license agreement during there were no milestone payments received in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities of million in compared to was primarily due to the receipt of payments under the viiv license agreement of million in as compared to million in net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease of million in was due to the sale of a marketable security in the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities of million in was due primarily to lower net proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities as compared to this was attributable to lower cash balances invested in marketable securities in due to the use of cash to fund operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities of million in compared to was primarily due to the receipt of proceeds related to the underwritten offerings in april and november of million as compared to the underwritten offering in april of million 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities of million in compared to was primarily due to million received in proceeds related to the issuance of stock to gsk pursuant to the stock purchase agreement entered in march this amount was offset by million in additional net proceeds we received in as compared to from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to underwritten agreements 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments set forth below is a description of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases settlement payments and other agreements long term obligations total contractual obligations included in the table above is million related to a settlement agreement we entered into in july with the university of alabama at birmingham  or uab  the university of alabama at birmingham research foundation  or uabrf  an affiliate of uab  and emory university relating to our telbivudine technology 
pursuant to this settlement agreement  all contractual disputes relating to patents covering the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hbv and all litigation matters relating to patents and patent applications related to the use of l deoxy nucleosides for the treatment of hbv assigned to one or more of idenix  le centre national de la recherche scientifique  or cnrs  and the universite montpellier ii  or the university of montpellier  and which cover the use of tyzeka sebivo telbivudine for the treatment of hbv have been resolved 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid uabrf on behalf of uab and emory university a million upfront payment and will make additional payments to uabrf equal to of all royalty payments received by us from novartis based on worldwide sales of telbivudine  subject to minimum payment obligations aggregating million 
our payment obligations under the settlement agreement will expire in august the settlement agreement was effective on june  and included mutual releases of all claims and covenants not to sue among the parties 
it also included a release from a third party scientist who had claimed to have inventorship rights in certain idenix cnrs university of montpellier patents 
in connection with certain of our operating leases  we have two letters of credit with a commercial bank totaling million which expire at varying dates through december  in december  we terminated an operating lease for office space in cambridge  ma 
the letter of credit associated with this lease of million was terminated in the first quarter of as of december   we had million of other long term liabilities recorded 
these liabilities and certain potential payment obligations relating to our hbv and hcv product and drug candidates that are described below are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the cash payments may be made 
in may  we entered into a settlement agreement with uab which provides for a milestone payment of million to uab upon receipt of regulatory approval in the united states to market and sell certain hcv products invented or discovered by our former chief executive officer during the period from november  to november  this settlement agreement also provides that we will pay uab an amount equal to of worldwide net sales of such hcv products with a minimum sales based payment equal to million 
currently  there are no such hcv products approved and therefore there was no related liability recorded as of december  we have potential payment obligations under the license agreement with the universita degli studi di cagliari  or the university of cagliari  pursuant to which we have the exclusive worldwide right to make  use and sell certain hcv and other technologies 
we made certain payments to the university of cagliari under these arrangements based on the payments we received from viiv under the viiv license agreement 
we are also 
table of contents liable for certain payments to the university of cagliari if we receive license fees or milestone payments with respect to such technology from novartis or another collaborator 
as a result of the termination of the viiv license agreement  we will not receive any additional milestone or royalty payments under the viiv license agreement and therefore do not expect to make future payments to the university of cagliari for the patent and patent applications related to in may  we and novartis entered into an amended and restated agreement with cnrs and the university of montpellier pursuant to which we worked in collaboration with scientists from cnrs and the university of montpellier to discover and develop technologies relating to antiviral substances  including telbivudine 
this cooperative agreement expired in december  but we retain rights to exploit the patents derived from the collaboration 
under the cooperative agreement  we are obligated to make royalty payments for products derived from such patents 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may the settlement agreement which we entered into with sumitomo provides for a million milestone payment to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
as part of the development and commercialization agreement  novartis will reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
in december  we retained the services of clariant subsequently acquired by archimica group  a provider of manufacturing services in the specialty chemicals industry  in the form of a multiproject development and supply agreement 
under the terms of the agreement with clariant  we would  on an as needed basis  utilize the clariant process development and manufacture services in the development of certain of our drug candidates  including telbivudine 
after reviewing respective bids from each of novartis and clariant  the joint manufacturing committee of idenix and novartis decided to proceed with novartis as the primary manufacturer of telbivudine 
in late  we transferred full responsibility to novartis for the development  commercialization and manufacturing of telbivudine 
as a result  in january  we exercised our right under the agreement with clariant to terminate the relationship effective july in february  clariant asserted that they should have been able to participate in the manufacturing process for telbivudine as a non primary supplier and therefore are due an unspecified amount 
we do not agree with clariant s assertion and since no estimate of a potential loss can be made  we have not recorded a liability associated with this potential contingent matter 
clariant has not initiated legal proceedings 
if legal proceedings are initiated  we intend to vigorously defend against such lawsuit 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  we believe that the following critical accounting policies are important to the understanding and evaluating of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
 as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and  for revenue arrangements entered into after june   in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
for multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified after january   we recognize revenue under accounting standard update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu no 
we record revenue provided that there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and or commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payments to us for non refundable license fees  milestones  collaborative research and development funding and royalties received from our collaboration partners 
non refundable license fee payments where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue over the expected development period as we complete our performance obligations 
when our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period or no other performance pattern is evident  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on the part of management 
payments received from collaboration partners for research and development efforts by us are recognized as revenue over the contract term as the related costs are incurred  net of any amounts due to the collaboration partner for costs incurred during the period for shared development costs 
where we have no continuing involvement or obligations under a collaborative arrangement  we record non refundable license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement 
milestone payments revenue is recognized for payments that are contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety  in the period in which the milestone is achieved  only if the milestone is substantive and meets all of the following criteria a performance consideration earned by achieving the milestone be commensurate with either performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from performance to achieve the milestone  b it relates to past performance  and c the payment is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
collaboration revenue related party we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates in may  which we refer to as the development and commercialization agreement 
under this arrangement  we have received non refundable license fees  milestones  collaborative research and development funding and royalty payments 
this agreement has several joint committees in which we and novartis participate 
we participate in these committees as a means to govern or protect our interests 
the 
table of contents committees span the period from early development through commercialization of drug candidates licensed by novartis 
as a result of applying the provisions of sab no 
 which was the applicable revenue guidance at the time the collaboration was entered into  our revenue recognition policy attributes revenue to the development period of the drug candidates licensed under the development and commercialization agreement 
we have not attributed revenue to our involvement in the committees following the commercialization of the licensed products as we have determined that our participation on the committees  as such participation relates to the commercialization of drug candidates  is protective 
our determination is based in part on the fact that our expertise is  and has been  the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases 
novartis  on the other hand  has the considerable commercialization expertise and infrastructure necessary for the commercialization of such drug candidates 
accordingly  we believe our obligation post commercialization is inconsequential 
we recognize non refundable payments received from novartis over the performance period of our continuing obligations 
in the second quarter of  we adjusted the period over which we amortize the deferred payments to be through may based on current judgments related to the product development timeline of our licensed drug candidates 
we review our assessment and judgment on a quarterly basis with respect to the expected duration of the development period of our licensed drug candidates 
if the estimated performance period changes  we will adjust the periodic revenue that is being recognized and will record the remaining unrecognized non refundable payments over the remaining development period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
upon the grant of options and stock awards under stock incentive plans  with the exception of the equity incentive plan  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less the exercise price  is recorded as a reduction of the non refundable payments associated with the novartis collaboration 
the amount is attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized through the current date and the remaining amount of deferred revenue 
these amounts will be adjusted through the date that novartis elects to purchase the shares to maintain its percentage ownership based upon changes in the value of our common stock and in novartis percentage ownership 
as of december   the aggregate impact of novartis stock subscription rights has reduced the non refundable payments by million  which has been recorded as additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million has been recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue with the remaining amount of million as a reduction of license fee revenue 
for the year ended december   the impact of novartis stock subscription rights has increased additional paid in capital by million  decreased deferred revenue by million and decreased license fee revenue by million 
royalty revenue consists of revenue earned under our license agreement with novartis for sales of tyzeka sebivo  which is recognized when reported from novartis 
royalty revenue is equal to a percentage of tyzeka sebivo net sales  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage varies based on the specified territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 
other revenue in february  we entered into the viiv license agreement 
under the viiv license agreement  we granted viiv an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  now known as  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids 
this agreement had performance obligations  including joint committee participation and viiv s right to license other nnrti compounds that we may develop in the future  that we had assessed under the fasb guidance related to multiple element arrangements  prior to the implementation of asu no 
we concluded that this arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and recognized as revenue using the contingency adjusted performance method 
under this agreement  we received a non refundable license fee payment and milestone payments from viiv 
these milestone payments did not meet our revenue recognition criteria for immediate recognition 
the non refundable license fee payment and milestone payments received 
table of contents from viiv were recorded as deferred revenue and were being recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement  which was estimated to be years 
a cumulative catch up was recognized for the period from the execution of the license agreement in march through the period in which the milestone payments were received 
in february  viiv informed us that the fda placed on clinical hold 
as a result of further evaluation  viiv determined that it would not continue development of or develop any other compound licensed under the viiv license agreement 
in december  viiv notified us that it would terminate the viiv license agreement effective march  upon termination  viiv will relinquish all rights it has in the intellectual property licensed from us and grants us an exclusive  perpetual and irrevocable license to any intellectual property relating to the licensed products it may have developed during the term of the license agreement 
as a result of the termination of the viiv license agreement  we will not receive any additional milestone or royalty payments under the viiv license agreement 
upon termination  we will have no future obligations pursuant to the license agreement and the deferred revenue balance of million at december  associated with the viiv license agreement is expected to be recognized as other collaboration revenue in the first quarter of government research grants that provide for payments to us for work performed are recognized as revenue when the related expense is incurred and we have obtained governmental approval to use the grant funds for these expenses 
deferred revenue in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may we repurchased these product rights for million 
the repurchase of these rights resulted in a million reversal of revenue that we previously recognized under our original arrangements with sumitomo 
we recorded the remaining amount of million as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we have also included million as deferred revenue  net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and representing amounts received from sumitomo that we have not included in our revenue to date 
we are required to pay an additional million to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
this payment will be recorded first as a reduction of the remaining million of deferred revenue  with the excess recorded as an expense 
as part of the development and commercialization agreement  novartis will reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
if regulatory approval is not received for telbivudine in japan  we would have no further obligations under the settlement agreement with sumitomo and  therefore  the million of remaining deferred revenue would be recognized as revenue at that time 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate expenses we have incurred for which we have not been invoiced 
this process involves estimating the level of service performed by third parties on our behalf and the associated cost incurred for these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses in which subjective judgments may be required include services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development  clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials 
accruals for amounts due to clinical research organizations are among our most significant estimates 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by the service providers 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we 
table of contents underestimate or overestimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation for employees and directors using a fair value based method that results in expense being recognized in our financial statements 
we make assumptions related to the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term of the awards granted in order to value and expense our share based compensation 
the expected option term and expected volatility are determined by examining the expected option term and volatility of our own stock as well as those of similarly sized biotechnology companies 
we review these assumptions periodically 
the amounts recognized for share based compensation expense could vary depending upon changes in these assumptions 
share based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest and should be reduced for estimated forfeitures 
during  and  because substantially all of our stock option grants vest monthly  no forfeiture assumption was applied 
for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we allocate share based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option grants 
we expect to continue to grant options to purchase common stock in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in june   the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and requires retrospective application to all periods presented 
we do not expect that this guidance will have any material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk changes in interest rates may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maintaining liquidity until it is required to fund operations 
to minimize risk  we maintain our operating cash in commercial bank accounts 
we invest our cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily government agency and treasury money market instruments 
due to the nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign currency transactions include agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in foreign currencies  european subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies and royalties earned based on worldwide product sales of sebivo by novartis 
as a result of these foreign currency transactions  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates
