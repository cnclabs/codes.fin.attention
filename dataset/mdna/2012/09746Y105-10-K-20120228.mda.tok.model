item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec  the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forward looking statement 
we cannot guarantee that our actual results will be consistent with the forward looking statements we make in this report  and we do not assume an obligation to update any forward looking statement 
risks related to industry conditions some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 
our uncoated freesheet papers and newsprint compete with electronic data transmission  document storage alternatives  and paper grades we do not produce 
increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage 
neither the timing nor the extent of this shift can be predicted with certainty 
because of these trends  demand may shift from one grade to another or be eliminated altogether 
we may not be able to grow our packaging business quickly enough to offset declines in uncoated freesheet papers and newsprint 
increases in the cost of our raw materials  including wood fiber  chemicals  and energy  could affect our profitability 
we rely heavily on raw materials  including wood fiber and chemicals  and energy sources  including natural gas and electricity 
our profitability has been  and will continue to be  affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials 
for most of our products  the relationship between industry supply and demand  rather than changes in the cost of raw materials  determines our ability to increase prices 
consequently  we may be unable to pass increases in our operating costs on to our customers in the short term 
any sustained increase in raw material costs  coupled with our inability to increase prices  would reduce our operating margins and potentially require us to limit or cease operations of one or more of our machines or facilities 
wood fiber  including purchased rollstock consumed in our corrugated operations  is our principal raw material  accounting for approximately million of the aggregate amount of materials  labor  and other operating expenses  including fiber costs from related parties  for the year ended december  wood fiber is a commodity  and prices have historically been cyclical 
in addition  wood fiber  including wood chips  sawdust  and shavings  is a byproduct in the manufacture of building products  and the availability of wood fiber is often negatively affected if demand for building products declines 
severe or sustained shortages of fiber could cause us to curtail our own operations  resulting in material and adverse effects on our sales and profitability 
future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands  the protection of endangered species  and forest health can also affect log and fiber supply 
energy accounted for approximately million of the aggregate amount of materials  labor  and other operating expenses  including fiber costs from related parties  for the year ended december  energy prices  particularly for electricity and natural gas  can be volatile  which affect our manufacturing costs and contribute significantly to earnings volatility 
other raw materials we use include various chemical compounds  such as starch  caustic soda  precipitated calcium carbonate  sodium chlorate  dyestuffs  and optical brighteners 
purchases of chemicals accounted for approximately million of the aggregate amount of materials  labor  and other operating expenses  including fiber costs from related parties  for the year ended december  the costs of these chemicals have been volatile historically and are influenced by capacity utilization  energy prices  and other factors beyond our control 
the paper industry experiences cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
historically  macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity have created cyclical changes in prices  sales volumes  and margins for our products 
changing industry conditions can influence paper and packaging producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to continue to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which could prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply in these markets can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable short term pricing trends 
industry supply is also influenced by overseas production capacity  which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow 
a weak us dollar tends to mitigate the levels of imports  while a strong us dollar tends to increase imports of commodity paper products from overseas  putting downward pressure on prices 
prices for all of our products are driven by many factors outside our control  and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our commodity products  and as a result  the price for any one or more of these products may fall below our cash production costs  requiring us to either incur short term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities 
from time to time  we have taken downtime or slowed production at some of our mills to balance our production with the market demand for our products  and we may continue to do so in the future 
some of our competitors may also close or reduce production at their operating facilities  some of which could reopen and increase production capacity 
this potential supply and demand imbalance could cause prices to fall 
therefore  our ability to achieve acceptable operating performance and margins is principally dependent on managing our cost structure  managing changes in raw materials prices which represent a large component of our operating costs and fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control  and general conditions in the paper market 
if the prices for our products decline or if our raw material costs increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
we face strong competition in our markets 
the packaging  paper  and newsprint industries are highly competitive 
we face competition from numerous competitors  domestic as well as foreign 
some of our competitors are large  vertically integrated companies that have greater financial and other resources  greater manufacturing economies of scale  greater energy self sufficiency  or lower operating costs  compared with our company 
we may be unable to compete with other companies in the market during the various stages of the business cycle and particularly during any downturns 
some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors including foreign producers into the markets we serve  our competitors pricing strategies  our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences  and our inability to maintain the cost efficiency of our facilities 
risks related to our operations we are subject to significant environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  and the cost of compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operation 
we are subject to a wide range of general and industry specific environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we may face civil or criminal fines  penalties  or enforcement actions  including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment  or other remedial actions 
we anticipate that governmental regulation of our operations will continue to become more burdensome and that we will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures in order to maintain compliance with applicable laws 
for example  in december  the u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa released their most recent proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for major sources industrial  commercial  and institutional boilers and process heaters boiler mact rules 
the proposed boiler mact rules will require process modifications and or installation of air pollution controls on power boilers principally our biomass fuel fired boilers at our pulp and paper mills  and we are currently reviewing those rules to understand the effect they will have on our operations 
the cost of compliance is likely to be significant 
our current estimates  based on the december boiler mact rule reproposal  indicate we will incur additional capital spending of up to million for compliance at our paper mills 
compliance with final boiler mact rules may also affect operating costs for the paper mills  as some mills may be required to narrow the list of fuels used for energy recovery in their boilers 
final impacts on fuel use and fuel costs cannot be precisely determined at this time due to ambiguities in the proposed rule revisions and the likelihood that additional guidance and rule revisions will be forthcoming from epa 
we may also be affected by the enactment of laws concerning climate change that regulate greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
such laws may require buying allowances for mill ghg emissions or capital expenditures to reduce ghg emissions 
because environmental regulations are not consistent worldwide  our capital and operating expenditures for environmental compliance may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we spent million in and expect to spend about million in for capital environmental compliance requirements 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant additional expenditures 
we may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
during we entered into two acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions  which in each case could materially affect our business  operating results  liquidity  and financial condition 
in addition to our recent acquisitions  we may continue seeking to acquire other businesses  products  or assets 
however  we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition candidates  and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms  if at all 
our recent and future acquisitions  assuming we complete them  may not strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals 
our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day responsibilities  increase our expenses  and adversely affect our business  operating results  liquidity  and financial condition 
our recent and any future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage the integration of our recently acquired businesses  or businesses we may acquire in the future  or be able to retain and motivate key personnel from those businesses 
difficulties encountered in the integration process could increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations 
officemax represents a significant portion of our business 
our largest customer  officemax  accounted for approximately and of our total sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in june  officemax agreed to continue to buy and we agreed to continue to supply virtually all of officemax s north american requirements for office papers through after  the agreement requires officemax to buy and us to supply at least of officemax s requirements for office papers through december as discussed in part i  item business of this form k  officemax s purchase obligations may terminate earlier under some circumstances and phase out over two to four years 
significant reductions in paper purchases from officemax would cause us to expand our customer base and could potentially decrease our profitability if new customer sales required either a decrease in our pricing and or an increase in our cost of sales 
any significant deterioration in the financial condition of officemax affecting its ability to pay or causing a significant change in its willingness to continue to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales  or negatively affect our net income 
any of our manufacturing facilities  or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including the following maintenance outages 
prolonged power failures 
equipment failure 
disruption in the supply of raw materials  such as wood fiber  energy  or chemicals 
a chemical spill or release 
closure because of environmental related concerns 
explosion of a boiler 
labor difficulties 
other operational problems 
the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on our water supply 
disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railroad tracks  and tunnels 
fires  floods  earthquakes  hurricanes  or other catastrophes 
terrorism or threats of terrorism 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if our machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime  our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired  resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our financial results 
labor disruptions or increased labor costs could materially adversely affect our business 
while we believe we have good labor relations  we could experience a material labor disruption  strike  or significantly increased labor costs at one or more of our facilities  either in the course of negotiations of a labor agreement or otherwise 
either of these situations could prevent us from meeting customer demands or result in increased costs  thereby reducing our sales and profitability 
as of january   we had approximately  employees  and approximately of those employees work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements 
in january  employees at one of our locations approved a new collective bargaining agreement 
following the approval of this agreement  approximately of our total employees are working pursuant to collective bargaining agreements that will expire within one year 
when negotiating our collective bargaining agreements in the future  our potential inability to reach a mutually acceptable labor contract at any of our facilities could result in  among other things  strikes or other work stoppages or slowdowns by the affected employees 
while the company has in place contingency plans to address labor disturbances  we could experience disruption to our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
future labor agreements could increase our costs of healthcare  retirement benefits  wages  and other employee benefits 
additionally  labor issues that affect our suppliers could also have a material adverse effect on us if those issues interfere with our ability to obtain raw materials on a cost effective and timely basis 
we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees 
our employees  particularly our key management  are vital to our success and difficult to replace 
we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees  particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market 
additionally  some of our senior managers are approaching typical retirement age 
failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees  or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan  could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets  adversely affecting our business 
risks related to economic and financial factors adverse business and global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
general global economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods  employment levels  the availability and cost of credit  and ultimately  the profitability of our business 
high unemployment rates  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment  and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products 
these conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business  results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
our operations require substantial capital  and we may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of our capital requirements 
our businesses are capital intensive  and we regularly incur capital expenditures to maintain our equipment  increase our operating efficiency  and comply with environmental laws 
in addition  significant amounts of capital are required to modify our equipment to produce alternative or additional products or to make significant improvements in the characteristics of our current products 
during the year ended december   our total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million 
we expect capital investments in to be between million and million  excluding acquisitions 
if we require funds for operating needs and capital expenditures beyond those generated from operations and we are unable to access our revolving credit facility  we may not be able to obtain them on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  our debt service obligations will reduce our available liquidity 
if we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as necessary for our continued operations or as needed to ensure environmental compliance  we could be required to cease or curtail some of our manufacturing operations or we may become unable to manufacture products that can compete effectively in one or more of our markets 
our ability to repay our debt is dependent on our ability to generate cash from operations 
as of december   our total indebtedness was million 
our ability to repay our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from future operations 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that are beyond our control 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain additional debt would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations 
our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us  and a default under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our credit facilities require bz intermediate holdings llc bz intermediate and its subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy specified financial tests 
these tests include  in the case of our credit facilities  an interest expense coverage ratio  a senior secured leverage ratio  and a total leverage ratio 
in addition  our credit facilities restrict  and the indentures governing the and senior notes restrict  among other things  the ability of bz intermediate and its subsidiaries to make some types of restricted payments  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
we will need to seek permission from the lenders under our indebtedness to engage in specified corporate actions 
the lenders interests may be different from our interests  and no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the lenders permission when needed 
various risks  uncertainties  and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants 
failure to comply with these covenants or similar covenants contained in future financing agreements could result in a default under the credit facilities  the indentures governing the and senior notes  and other agreements containing cross default provisions  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations 
a default would permit lenders or holders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements  to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt  and to terminate any commitments to lend 
under these circumstances  we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations  including the obligations of boise paper holdings  llc  boise finance company  and boise co issuer company under the and senior notes 
in addition  the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing 
we anticipate significant future funding obligations for pension benefits 
most of our pension benefits plans are frozen  however  we will continue to have significant obligations for pension benefits 
as of december   our pension assets had a market value of million  compared with million at december  assuming a return on plan assets of in and  we will contribute at least the required minimum contributions of approximately million in and approximately million in the amount of required contributions will depend  among other things  on actual returns on plan assets  changes in interest rates that affect our discount rate assumptions  changes in pension funding requirement laws  and modifications to our plans 
our estimates may change materially depending upon the impact of these and other factors  and the amount of our contributions may adversely affect our liquidity  financial condition  and results of operations
