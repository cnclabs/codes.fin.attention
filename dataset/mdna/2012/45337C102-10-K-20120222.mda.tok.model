item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our current clinical pipeline includes the following compounds target drug compound indication status jak and jak jakafi intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis fda approved marketed ruxolitinib incb polycythemia vera phase iii ruxolitinib incb essential thrombocythemia phase ii ruxolitinib incb pancreatic cancer phase ii ruxolitinib incb solid tumors and other hematologic phase i and phase ii malignancies ly incb rheumatoid arthritis phase iib ly incb psoriasis phase iib c met incb solid tumors phase i ido incb solid tumors phase i we licensed rights outside the united states to novartis and retained us rights 
we licensed worldwide rights to lilly and have elected to co develop with lilly and we retain a co promotion option 
we licensed worldwide rights to lilly and retained co development and co promotion options 
we licensed worldwide rights to novartis and retained co development and co promotion options 
several clinical trials in patients with myelofibrosis are ongoing  including long term extension studies  a joint global phase ii trial with novartis in patients with low platelet counts  and an incyte sponsored phase ii trial in patients with low platelet counts 
these studies are investigator sponsored trials 
the therapeutic and commercial value of new medicines is difficult to predict  and conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates in development is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
therefore  if we are unable to successfully commercialize jakafi or develop and market some of our other pharmaceutical products over the next several years  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 
to date  we have not  and we may never  achieve sustained revenues sufficient to offset expenses 
we may incur net losses in future periods  and we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we also expect that our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and that those fluctuations may be substantial 
license agreements novartis in november  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
under the terms of the agreement  novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to ruxolitinib and certain back up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications  including all hematological malignancies  solid 
table of contents tumors and myeloproliferative diseases 
we retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib in the united states and in certain other indications 
novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c met inhibitor compound incb and certain back up compounds in all indications 
we retained options to co develop and to co promote incb in the united states 
under this agreement  we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to approximately billion if defined development and commercialization milestones are achieved 
in  we received million in milestone payments under this agreement and in we received a million milestone payment 
we also could receive tiered  double digit royalties on future ruxolitinib sales outside of the united states 
each company is responsible for costs relating to the development and commercialization of the jak inhibitor compound in its respective territories  with costs of collaborative studies shared equally 
novartis is responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the c met inhibitor compound after the initial phase i clinical trial 
the novartis agreement will continue on a program by program basis until novartis has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or  if earlier  the termination of the agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
the agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program by program basis by novartis for convenience 
the agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances  including material breach 
lilly in december  we entered into a license  development and commercialization agreement with eli lilly and company 
under the terms of the agreement  lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to ly and certain back up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
we received an initial payment of million  and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to million based on the achievement of defined development  regulatory and commercialization milestones 
in  we received million in milestone payments from lilly 
we also could receive tiered  double digit royalty payments on future global sales with rates ranging up to if the product is successfully commercialized 
we retained options to co develop our jak jak inhibitors with lilly on a compound by compound and indication by indication basis 
lilly will be responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the compounds unless we elect to co develop any compounds or indications 
if we elect to co develop any compounds and or indications  we would be responsible for funding of the associated future global development costs from the initiation of a phase iib trial through regulatory approval 
we would receive an incremental royalty rate increase across all tiers resulting in effective royalty rates ranging up to the high twenties on potential future global sales for compounds and or indications that we elect to co develop 
we also retained an option to co promote products in the united states 
in july  we elected to co develop ly with lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of a phase iib trial through regulatory approval 
the lilly agreement will continue until lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or  if earlier  the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms 
the agreement may be terminated by lilly for convenience  and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances  including material breach 
pfizer in january  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer inc for the pursuit of our ccr antagonist program 
pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of ccr antagonist compounds 
pfizer s rights extend to the full scope of potential 
table of contents indications  with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides  where we retained worldwide rights  along with certain compounds 
we do not have obligations to pfizer on pre clinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications 
the agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement 
prior to such expiration  either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party 
in addition  pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time upon days notice 
we received an upfront nonrefundable  non creditable payment of million in january and are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments 
we received a million milestone payment from pfizer in critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  research and development costs  stock compensation  investments  inventory  and convertible debt and derivative accounting 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist 
we exercise judgment in determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the customer s payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer 
product revenues our product revenues consist of us sales of jakafi and are recognized once we meet all four revenue recognition criteria described above 
upon receipt of product by the specialty pharmacy  we meet three of the four revenue recognition criteria in that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured 
however  at the time of receipt of product by the specialty pharmacy  we presently do not have the ability to estimate product that will ultimately be returned due to our lack of history with product revenues at this time 
accordingly  the price is not deemed fixed and determinable at this time since jakafi is a new and novel product  jakafi is the first approved treatment for intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis  and jakafi is the first ever commercial drug product for incyte 

table of contents therefore  we recognize revenue once the specialty pharmacy has filled the patient s prescription for jakafi 
this approach is frequently referred to as the sell through revenue recognition model 
under the sell through approach  revenue is recognized when the specialty pharmacy provides product to a patient based on the fulfillment of a prescription 
once the prescription has been filled and it is no longer in the specialty pharmacy s inventory  it may no longer be returned to incyte by the specialty pharmacy 
we recognize revenues for prescriptions filled net of allowances for customer credits  including estimated rebates  discounts  returns  distribution service fees  patients assistance programs  and medicare part d coverage gap reimbursements 
product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
customer credits the specialty pharmacies are offered various forms of consideration including allowances  service fees and prompt payment discounts 
we expect the specialty pharmacies will earn prompt payment discounts and  therefore  we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized 
service fees are also deducted from product sales as they are earned 
rebates allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program 
rebate amounts are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector eg  medicaid benefit providers 
rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector benefit providers 
the allowance for rebates is based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization 
our estimates for the expected utilization of rebates are based in part on third party market research data  and data received from the specialty pharmacies 
rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual balance for known prior quarter s unpaid rebates 
if actual future rebates vary from estimates  we may need to adjust prior period accruals  which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment 
chargebacks chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from a specialty pharmacy  or an intermediary distributor 
contracted customers  which currently consist primarily of public health service institutions  non profit clinics  and federal government entities purchasing via the federal supply schedule  generally purchase the product at a discounted price 
the specialty pharmacy or distributor  in turn  charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the specialty pharmacy or distributor and the discounted price paid to the specialty pharmacy or distributor by the customer 
the allowance for chargebacks is based on known sales to contracted customers 
medicare part d coverage gap medicare part d prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to fund of the medicare part d insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients 
our estimates for expected medicare part d coverage gap are based in part on third party market research data  and data received from the specialty pharmacies 
funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters 
if actual future funding varies from estimates  we may need to adjust prior period accruals  which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment 
co payment assistance patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co payment assistance 
we accrue a liability for co payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third party administrators 
contract  license and royalty revenues under agreements involving multiple deliverables  services and or rights to use assets that we entered into prior to january   the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when 
table of contents certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
when separate units of accounting exist  consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values 
the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers 
if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed 
when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we assess whether a substantive milestone exists at the inception of our agreements 
for all milestones within our arrangements that are considered substantive  we recognize revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone 
if a milestone is not considered substantive  we would recognize the applicable milestone payment over the remaining period of performance under the arrangement 
as of december   all remaining potential milestones under our collaborative arrangements are considered substantive 
on january   updated guidance on the recognition of revenues for agreements with multiple deliverables became effective and applies to any agreements we may enter into on or after january  this updated guidance i relates to whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in a revenue arrangement should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated  ii requires companies to allocate revenues in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price  and iii eliminates the use of the residual method and requires companies to allocate revenues using the relative selling price method 
during the year ended december   we did not enter into any agreements that are subject to this updated guidance 
if we enter into an agreement with multiple deliverables after january   this updated guidance could have a material effect on our financial statements 
our collaborations often include contractual milestones  which typically relate to the achievement of pre specified development  regulatory and commercialization events 
these three categories of milestone events reflect the three stages of the life cycle of our drugs  which we describe in more detail in the following paragraph 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug candidate  is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
securing approval by the us food and drug administration fda requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish a drug candidate s safety and efficacy 
the approval process takes many years  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
before commencing clinical investigations of a drug candidate in humans  we must submit an investigational new drug application ind  which must be reviewed by the fda 
the steps generally required before a drug may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  animal studies and formulation studies  submission to the fda of an ind for human clinical testing  performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials in three phases  as described below  to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  submission of a new drug application nda to the fda for review and fda approval of the nda 
similar requirements exist within foreign regulatory agencies as well 
the time required to satisfy the fda requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease 
preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology  drug metabolism  and toxicity  which includes animal studies  to assess potential safety and efficacy as well as product chemistry  
table of contents stability  formulation  development  and testing 
the results of the preclinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
the fda may raise concerns or questions about safety issues such as the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the ind  and any of these concerns or questions must be resolved before clinical trials can proceed 
we cannot be sure that submission of an ind will result in the fda allowing clinical trials to commence 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or the marketed drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with good clinical practices regulations covering the protection of human subjects 
clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap or be combined 
phase i usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
phase ii usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  and evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications 
phase iii clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population  providing statistical evidence of efficacy and safety  and providing an adequate basis for labeling 
we cannot guarantee that phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time  if at all 
furthermore  we  the institutional review board for a trial  or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
generally  the milestone events contained in our collaboration agreements coincide with the progression of our drugs from development  to regulatory approval and then to commercialization 
the process of successfully discovering a new development candidate  having it approved and successfully commercialized is highly uncertain 
as such  the milestone payments we may earn from our partners involve a significant degree of risk to achieve 
therefore  as a drug candidate progresses through the stages of its life cycle  the value of the drug candidate generally increases 
revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms 
we estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee 
we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon 
research and development costs 
our policy is to expense research and development costs as incurred 
we often contract with clinical research organizations cros to facilitate  coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug 
to ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred  we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract 
these cro contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones 
in the event that we prepay cro fees  we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed 
most professional fees  including project and clinical management  data management  monitoring  and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period 
these professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date 
our cro contracts generally include pass through fees 
pass through fees include  but are not limited to  regulatory expenses  investigator fees  travel costs  and other miscellaneous costs  including shipping and printing fees 
we expense the costs of pass through fees under our cro contracts as they are incurred  based on the best information available to us at the time 
the estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence with the cros  internal reviews and a review of contractual terms 
the factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled  
table of contents duration of the clinical trial  estimated patient attrition  screening rate and length of the dosing regimen 
cro fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period 
reimbursable costs incurred in connection with collaborative license agreements are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses 
stock compensation 
accounting guidance for stock compensation requires all share based payment transactions with employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their fair values 
the accounting guidance also requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation and requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations 
we recorded million  million and million of stock compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investments 
we carry our investments at their respective fair values 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future repayment potential  the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and if we intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if management determines that such an impairment exists  we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment or marketable security prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments and marketable securities as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
we classify those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one year as short term investments 
those marketable securities in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent condensed consolidated balance sheet date are classified as long term marketable securities 
inventory 
inventories are determined at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the specific identification method 
inventories consisted of raw materials at december  but we may also have work in process and finished goods at any given time 
we began capitalizing inventory in mid november once the fda approved jakafi as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
costs incurred prior to approval of jakafi have been recorded as research and development expense in our statement of operations 
as a result  inventory balances and cost of revenue for the next several quarters will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials 
convertible debt and derivative accounting 
we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for  and if bifurcation requirements are met  whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liabilities 
if the embedded feature meets the requirements to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability  the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially  included as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet  and remeasured each reporting period 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
we monitor  on an ongoing basis  whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and we recorded net losses for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively

as we currently have no historical data on returns  we currently use the sell through method for revenue recognition under which we defer revenue until the patient receives jakafi 
we plan to transition to the sell in method of recognizing revenue when jakafi is received by the specialty pharmacy once a sufficient period of time has elapsed to enable us to estimate product returns 
our contract revenues were million and million in and  respectively 
for the year ended december  and  contract revenues were derived from the straight line recognition of revenue associated with the novartis and lilly upfront fees over the estimated performance periods 
the upfront fees related to the novartis agreement included a million upfront payment received in  a million immediate milestone payment received in and million of reimbursable costs incurred prior to the effective date of the agreement 
the upfront fees related to the lilly agreement consisted of a million upfront payment received in the decrease from to primarily relates to recognition of million in milestone payments from novartis  lilly and pfizer in compared to the recognition of million in milestone payments from novartis in cost of revenues we began capitalizing inventory in mid november once the fda approved jakafi as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product

salary and benefits related expense increased from to due to increased development headcount to sustain our development pipeline 
stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted  stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity based compensation 
the increase in clinical research and outside services expense from to was primarily the result of increased development costs 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  and were net of million and million  respectively  of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners 
the increase in occupancy and all other costs from to was primarily the result of increased laboratory expenses 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials  including requests by regulatory agencies for more information  inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects among patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials 
in addition  the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products 
in july  we elected to co develop ly with lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of a phase iib trial through regulatory approval 
we have retained certain mechanisms to give us cost protection as ly advances in clinical development 
we can defer our portion of co development study costs by indication if they exceed a predetermined level 
this deferment would be credited against future milestones or royalties and we would still be eligible for the full incremental royalties related to the co development option 
in addition  even if we have started co development funding for any indication  we can at any time opt out for that indication and stop future co development cost sharing 
if we elect to do this we would still be eligible for our base royalties plus an incremental pro rated royalty commensurate with our contribution to the total co development cost for those indications for which we contributed funding

research or development arrangements frequently include payment provisions whereby a portion or all of the consideration is contingent upon milestone events such as successful completion of phases in a study or achieving a specific result from the research or development efforts 
the guidance provides criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
we adopted this guidance on january   which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions total less than year years years over years contractual obligations principal on convertible subordinated debt principal on convertible senior debt interest on convertible senior debt non cancelable operating lease obligations related to corporate headquarters total contractual obligations we have funded an escrow account of million as of december  for interest payments through october on our convertible senior notes 
the table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events 
the most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations are summarized below 
commitments related to maxia pharmaceuticals  inc are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable 
in february  we completed our acquisition of maxia 
under the merger agreement  former maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of million upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
twenty percent of each earn out payment  if earned  will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock 
none of these milestones has been achieved as of december  we have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies or drug development candidates in connection with our drug discovery and development programs 
under these licenses  we may be required to pay up front fees  milestone payments  and royalties on sales of future products 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations  expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into  including the agreements with novartis  lilly and pfizer  the extent to which commercialization of jakafi is successful  and expenditures in connection with strategic relationships and license agreements 
changes in our research and development or commercialization plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations 
the sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock 
debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our 
table of contents ability to incur further indebtedness 
the indenture under which our convertible senior notes due are issued contains a covenant that  among other things  limits our ability and the ability of any of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  or sell  lease  license  transfer or otherwise dispose of certain of our or their assets 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to scale back our operations  delay or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborator or licensee that would result in terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments in marketable securities  which are composed primarily of us government agency and non agency mortgage backed securities and money market funds  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rate interest rates increase 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  excluding a funded restricted cash and investment escrow account of million reserved for interest payments through october on our convertible senior notes due due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in fair value would not be material
