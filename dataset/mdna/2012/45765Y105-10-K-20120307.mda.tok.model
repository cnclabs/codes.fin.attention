critical accounting policies our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  and stock based compensation expense 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from insignia popsigns ratably over the period of service  which is typically a two week display cycle 
we recognize revenue related to equipment  software and sign card sales at the time the products are shipped to customers 
revenue associated with maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue that has been billed and not yet recognized is reflected as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors could result in materially different amounts 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets for impairment indicators 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the assets in relation to the future cash flows of the underlying operations to assess recoverability of the assets 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections believed by management to be reasonable and supportable 
they require management s subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates 
impaired assets are then recorded at their estimated fair market value 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 

table of contents we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
during the year ended december   the company utilized the full federal net operating loss carryforward and the majority of the state net operating loss carryforward available to it as a result of the taxable income generated from the lawsuit settlement with news america on february  stock based compensation 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options and employee stock purchase plan rights 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected terms of the options and employee stock purchase plan rights are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date 
volatility is based on historical and expected future volatility of the company s stock 
the company has not historically issued any dividends  beyond the one time special dividend declared on february  and paid on may   and does not expect to in the future 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of the grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the valuation of grants in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  that provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
as a result of these amendments  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under previous us gaap 
the asu does this by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
a vendor will be required to determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
this asu also eliminates the residual method of allocation and will require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  which allocates any discount in the overall arrangement proportionally to each deliverable based on its relative selling price 
this standard became effective for the company in january and did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition
