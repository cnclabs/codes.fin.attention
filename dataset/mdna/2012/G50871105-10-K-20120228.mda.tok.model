the merger on january   pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization  dated as of september   as amended  or the merger agreement  a wholly owned subsidiary of jazz pharmaceuticals plc formerly known as azur pharma public limited company merged with and into jazz pharmaceuticals  inc  with jazz pharmaceuticals  inc 
surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of jazz pharmaceuticals plc  which merger is referred to herein as the merger 
pursuant to the merger agreement  azur pharma changed its name to jazz pharmaceuticals plc and each share of the common stock  par value per share  of jazz pharmaceuticals  inc issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was canceled and automatically converted into and became the right to receive one ordinary share  nominal value per share  of jazz pharmaceuticals plc 
immediately after giving effect to the issuance of our ordinary shares to the former stockholders of jazz pharmaceuticals  inc in the merger  approximately of our ordinary shares were held by the former stockholders of jazz pharmaceuticals  inc and the remaining of our ordinary shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the merger were held by persons and entities who acquired our ordinary shares prior to the merger 
the ordinary shares of jazz pharmaceuticals plc trade on the same exchange  the nasdaq global select market  and under the trading symbol jazz  as the jazz pharmaceuticals  inc common stock prior to the merger 
we are considered to be the successor to jazz pharmaceuticals  inc for certain purposes under both the securities exchange act of  as amended and the securities act of  as amended 
jazz pharmaceuticals  inc is treated as the acquiring company in the merger for accounting purposes  and the merger is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements of jazz pharmaceuticals  inc became our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k do not cover any operations of azur pharma prior to the merger because the merger was consummated after the periods covered by the financial statements included in this annual report on form k

table of contents overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the identification  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products to meet important unmet medical needs in focused therapeutic areas 
our marketed products include xyrem sodium oxybate oral solution  which is the only product approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of both cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy  our psychiatry products  fazaclo clozapine  usp ld and fazaclo hd  orally disintegrating clozapine tablets indicated for treatment resistant schizophrenia  and luvox cr fluvoxamine maleate marketed for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder  prialt ziconotide intrathecal injection  the only non opioid intrathecal analgesic indicated for refractory severe chronic pain  and a portfolio of women s health and other products led by elestrin estradiol gel  indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause 
in we achieved our second successive year of profitability  with significant increases in net income and operating cash flows  driven by increases in product sales  in particular an increase in sales of xyrem 
in  net income and operating cash flows were million and million  respectively  representing increases of and over  respectively 
in july  with cash generated from operations  we repaid in full the million principal amount of our term loan and as of december  we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt 
while we have a more diversified product portfolio as a result of the merger  xyrem continues to be our largest selling product 
as a result  we continue to place a high priority on growing sales of xyrem in its approved indications and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
our ability to maintain or increase xyrem product sales is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  as set forth in part i item a of this annual report on form k 
we plan to leverage the commercial  medical and scientific experience of the combined enterprise resulting from the merger in maximizing the potential of our other products and product candidates 
results of operations the following table presents revenues and expenses for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands change change product sales  net xyrem luvox cr royalties and contract revenues cost of product sales excluding amortization of acquired developed technology selling  general and administrative research and development intangible asset amortization interest income and other  net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt   n a comparison to prior period is not meaningful 
product sales  net xyrem product sales increased in and compared to the immediately preceding years  primarily due to price increases and to a lesser extent increases in sales volume of in and in luvox cr product sales increased in compared to  primarily due to price increases and to a lesser extent 
table of contents increases in sales volume 
luvox cr product sales increased in compared to  primarily due to increases in sales volumes and to a lesser extent price increases 
we expect total product sales will increase in over due to growth in sales of xyrem and due to the inclusion of product sales from our expanded product portfolio resulting from the merger  which will be included in our revenue from the effective time of the merger on january  royalties and contract revenues royalties and contract revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to the recognition of a million milestone payment related to sales of xyrem in europe by ucb pharma limited  or ucb  under a license agreement 
royalties and contract revenues decreased in as compared to due to the recognition of a million milestone payment in which was received from ucb in we expect royalty and contract revenue to decrease slightly in as compared to cost of product sales cost of product sales increased in and compared to the immediately preceding years primarily due to increased sales volumes in both years 
as a percentage of product sales  costs were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in was primarily due to increases in average selling prices 
we expect cost of product sales as a percentage of sales to increase in compared to because the cost of product sales as a percentage of revenue on the products added to our portfolio as a result of the merger is higher than that of our existing products 
in addition  we expect to record expense related to the fair value adjustment to azur pharma s inventory held at the effective time of the merger 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were higher in compared to  primarily due to increases in employee related expenses as a result of an increase in commercial activities  higher stock based compensation expense including million resulting from the modification of certain stock options in connection with the merger and higher legal and professional expenses of million associated with the merger 
selling  general and administrative expenses were higher in compared to  primarily due to increases in employee related expenses and  to a lesser extent  expenses related to our previously planned launch of a product candidate 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will be higher in than in due to the inclusion of expenses of the former azur pharma business subsequent to the effective time of the merger on january  research and development expenses research and development expenses were lower in and compared to the immediately preceding years 
direct project costs decreased to million in from million in and million in  primarily due to the completion in of a clinical development program 
our direct development project costs consist primarily of out sourced study costs  including investigator payments and consulting fees 
headcount related expenses incurred in the research and development organization were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect research and development expenses to be higher in than in due to the inclusion of expenses of the former azur pharma business subsequent to the effective time of the merger on january  intangible asset amortization during  and our intangible assets consisted primarily of developed technology related to xyrem and luvox cr  which are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
as a result 
table of contents of the merger we expect to record a significant amount of intangible assets and accordingly we expect intangible asset amortization to increase significantly in interest income and other  net interest income was higher in compared to because of higher cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income was lower in compared to due to lower average interest rates 
interest expense interest expense decreased in and compared to the immediately preceding years due to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
loss on extinguishment of debt in  as a result of the repayment of a term loan and the termination of a credit agreement  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million  which consisted of a million non cash charge related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a debt discount with the remainder related to a prepayment penalty and a termination fee 
the loss on extinguishment of debt in was due to the repayment of long term debt and consisted of million of prepayment premiums and fees  and a million non cash charge related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a debt discount 
non gaap financial measures to supplement our financial results presented on a gaap basis  we use the non gaap measures adjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per diluted share as shown in the table below 
we believe these non gaap financial measures are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our potential future results 
they are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
our management regularly uses these supplemental non gaap financial measures internally to understand  manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions 
compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non gaap measures 
in addition  we believe that the use of these non gaap measures enhances the ability of investors to compare our results from period to period 
adjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per diluted share  as used by us  may be calculated differently from  and therefore may not be directly comparable to  similarly titled measures used by our competitors and other companies 
these measures exclude the following contract revenues related to previously deferred upfront and milestone payments  the gross margin impact of a change in the timing of when luvox cr revenue is recognized  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation  non cash interest expense associated with a debt discount and debt issuance costs  loss on extinguishment of debt and costs related to the merger with azur pharma 

table of contents a reconciliation of gaap net income loss to adjusted net income loss  a non gaap financial measure  and related per share amounts follows year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts gaap net income loss add intangible asset amortization stock based compensation expense non cash interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt transaction and integration costs deduct contract revenues luvox cr revenue recognition timing change adjusted net income loss gaap net income loss per diluted share adjusted net income loss per diluted share shares used in computing gaap and adjusted net income loss per diluted share amounts liquidity and capital resources we generated cash flows from operations of million and million in and  respectively  and have taken a number of measures in the past two years designed to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity and financial condition 
most recently  in july  we repaid in full the million principal amount of a term loan and repaid all borrowings under a revolving credit facility and in december we terminated the credit agreement under which we made these borrowings 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
on a combined pro forma basis  we would have added an additional million in cash held by azur pharma as of december   and our combined business is expected to generate significant operating cash flows 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and to meet our existing obligations for the foreseeable future 
the adequacy of our cash resources depends on many assumptions  including primarily our assumptions with respect to product sales and expenses as well as the other factors set forth in part i item a of this annual report on form k under the headings xyrem is our largest selling product  and  if we are not able to maintain or increase sales of xyrem  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects and to grow our business  we will need to commit substantial resources  which could result in future losses or otherwise limit our opportunities or affect our ability to operate our business 
our assumptions may prove to be wrong or other factors may adversely affect our business  and as a result we could exhaust or significantly decrease our available cash resources which could  among other things  force us to raise additional funds and or force us to reduce our expenses  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to grow our business over the longer term  we will need to commit substantial resources to product acquisition and in licensing costs  to expensive and time consuming product development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and to expanding our commercial operations 
we may need to raise additional funds to license or acquire additional products  product candidates or companies or seek to raise additional funds for general corporate purposes 
raising additional capital could be accomplished through one or more public or private debt or equity financings  collaborations or partnering arrangements 
any equity financing would be dilutive to our stockholders 

table of contents the following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash from operating activities increased by million in primarily due to an increase in net income of million 
net cash from operating activities increased by million in primarily due to an increase in net income of million  a net increase in working capital of million and an increase in non cash adjustments of million which related primarily to the loss on extinguishment of long term debt 
net cash used in investing activities in primarily related to purchases of marketable securities  scheduled payments under our agreement for the rights to market luvox cr and to a lesser extent purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and releases of restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities in included scheduled payments under our agreement for the rights to market luvox cr  partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities in included scheduled payments under our agreement for the rights to market luvox cr and an increase in restricted cash  offset by the maturity of an investment in a marketable security 
net cash used in financing activities in included a repayment of million for the full principal amount outstanding under a term loan and million for net repayments of a revolving credit facility  partially offset by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and warrant exercises 
net cash used in financing activities in included the principal repayment of other long term debt of million offset by proceeds from a common stock offering of million and net cash inflows from a term loan of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in included net proceeds of million from a private placement of common stock and warrants and million in net borrowings under a prior revolving bank line of credit 
contractual obligations the table below presents a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands liability under government settlement purchased product rights liability operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we have not included milestone or royalty payments or contractual payment obligations in the table above if the amount and timing of such obligations are unknown or uncertain 
the table does not include a fee of million we were required to pay our investment banker contingent upon the successful completion of the merger with azur pharma 
we have not included any of the contractual obligations of azur pharma as of december  contractual obligations of azur pharma as of december  excluding milestone or royalty payments 
table of contents where the amount and timing of such obligations are unknown or uncertain principally related to an obligation to make payments totaling million related to the acquisition of rights to prialt due in  the obligation to make payments totaling million under operating leases and a fee of million payable to an investment banker contingent upon the successful completion of the merger  which fee was subsequently paid 
this represents payments due to abbott under a product license agreement 
these amounts exclude million we would pay abbott if net sales of luvox cr have reached a cumulative amount of million on or before december  and no ab rated generic version of luvox cr has been or is being sold in the united states as of december   because we do not know if we will have to pay it 
includes the minimum lease payments for our office building in palo alto and automobile lease payments for our sales force 
in february  we renewed the operating lease for our palo alto office building and as a result  we are obligated to make additional payments of million  million  million  million  million and million in     and in addition to the minimal lease payments on our office building we are obligated to pay for operating expenses for the lease property  which are not included in the table above 
consists of non cancelable commitments to third party manufacturers of xyrem and luvox cr 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the above discussion and analysis of our operating results and financial condition is based upon jazz pharmaceuticals  inc s consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accordingly  the following discussion of critical accounting policies and significant estimates pertains to jazz pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the merger 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales  net xyrem domestic 
we sell xyrem in the united states to a single central pharmacy  express scripts specialty distribution services and its affiliate curascript  inc  or express scripts 
in  sales of xyrem to express scripts accounted for of our net product sales 
we recognize revenues from sales of xyrem within the united states upon transfer of title  which occurs when express scripts removes product from our consigned inventory location at its facility for shipment directly to a patient 
we accept returns from and provide express scripts with a credit for any product returned by patients to express scripts with defects that were not reasonably discoverable upon receipt of the consigned product by express scripts 
based on our experience over the past six years  product returns to express scripts from patients are rare  during  we issued credits totaling million to express scripts for returned product 
xyrem international 
we sell limited quantities of xyrem to ucb for sale in territories outside of north america  and to valeant  for sale in canada  under license and distribution agreements 
we recognized revenue of million  million and million from international sales of xyrem during  and  respectively 

table of contents luvox cr 
we grant rights to our wholesaler customers to return product six months prior to and up to twelve months after product expiration and issue credits which may be applied against existing or future invoices 
we recognize revenue on sales of luvox cr when the product is delivered to our wholesaler customers and record an estimated amount of product returns 
items deducted from gross sales 
revenues from sales of products within the united states are recorded net of estimated allowances for returns  specialty distributor fees  wholesaler fees  prompt payment discounts  government rebates  government chargebacks  coupon programs and rebates under managed care plans 
calculating certain of these items involves estimates and judgments based on sales or invoice data  contractual terms  historical utilization rates  new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data 
because we derive most of our revenues from sales of xyrem in the united states to one specialty pharmacy customer  express scripts  we have a much higher level of knowledge about each prescription than if we sold the product through the normal pharmaceutical wholesaler channel as we do with luvox cr 
as a result  we do not exercise a high degree of judgment in estimating most of the items that are deducted from gross sales 
the two most significant items deducted from gross revenue where we exercise judgment are government rebates  which include medicaid and tricare rebates  and estimated returns of luvox cr 
the following table shows activity related to government rebates for xyrem and luvox cr and estimated returns of luvox cr government rebates payable sales returns reserve in thousands balance at december  provision related to sales in current year provision adjustment related to sales in prior year payments credits balance at december  provision related to sales in current year provision adjustment related to sales in prior year payments credits balance at december  provision related to sales in current year provision adjustment related to sales in prior year payments credits balance at december  contract revenues nonrefundable fees where we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement and collection is reasonably assured 
in situations where we have continuing performance obligations  nonrefundable fees are deferred and recognized ratably over our estimated performance period 
we recognize at risk milestone payments  which are typically related to regulatory  commercial or other achievements by us or our licensees and distributors  as revenues when the milestone is accomplished and collection is reasonably assured 
refundable fees are deferred and recognized as revenues upon the later of when they become nonrefundable or when our performance obligations are completed 
we have an agreement with ucb under which ucb has the right to market xyrem for certain indications in various countries outside the united states 
in  we recognized revenue of million when ucb recorded product sales exceeding an amount specified in our contract with them 
in  we received a million 
table of contents nonrefundable milestone payment which we recognized as revenue in upon achievement of the milestone 
we recognized contract revenues of million during each of   and related to two upfront payments from ucb totaling million 
as of december   million was recorded as deferred revenues related to these upfront payments and is being recognized ratably through  the end of the expected performance period under the agreement 
there has been no change in the expected performance period under our agreement with ucb since its establishment in at the time of the initial upfront payments 
a change in our estimate of the performance period would result in a change in contract revenues 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method for all inventories 
our policy is to write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected requirements 
the estimate of excess quantities is subjective and primarily dependent on our estimates of future demand for the product 
if our estimate of future demand is too high we may have to write down the carrying value of inventory and record additional charges to cost of product sales 
charges related to inventory reserves during  and were insignificant 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in october and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products therefore the goodwill impairment test is done by comparing our market capitalization  as determined by our traded share price  to the book value of net assets 
the annual test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this step indicates impairment  then in the second step  the loss is measured as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of all identified assets and liabilities 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of purchased developed technology and trademarks 
the method of amortization reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed 
if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  we use a straight line amortization method 
our intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to ten years 
the estimated useful lives associated with intangible assets are consistent with the estimated lives of the products and may be modified when circumstances warrant 
once an intangible asset is fully amortized  the gross costs and accumulated amortization are removed from the consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate purchased intangibles and other long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
estimating future cash flows related to an intangible asset involves estimates and assumptions 
if our assumptions are not correct  there could be an impairment loss or  in the case of a change in the estimated useful life of the asset  a change in amortization expense 
our two most significant intangible assets are related to xyrem for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy and the xyrem trade name  collectively the xyrem intangibles  which were recorded as part of an acquisition in as of december   those two assets had a carrying value of million  or of our total intangible asset carrying amount of million 
at the time of the acquisition we estimated the life 
table of contents of the xyrem intangibles to be years  or through december   which corresponded to the time period during which we expected the assets to generate cash flows in our valuation analysis 
as of december   the gross carrying amount of goodwill was million and the gross carrying amounts and net book values of intangible assets were as follows gross carrying amount accumulated amortization net book value weighted average remaining useful life in thousands in years developed technology xyrem developed technology luvox cr trademarks total stock based compensation we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock option grants under our equity incentive plans and grants under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and we are using the straight line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods 
the fair value of stock options was estimated using the following assumptions year ended december  volatility expected term years range of risk free rates expected dividend yield the two inputs which require the greatest judgment and have a large impact on fair values are expected term and volatility 
the expected term of stock options grants represents the weighted average period the awards are expected to remain outstanding 
for stock options granted in  we estimated the weighted average expected term based on historical exercise and expiration data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the grants 
prior to  the expected term was estimated by assuming stock options would be exercised at the mid point between the vest date and the contractual term due  at that time  to limited historical exercise data 
we use a weighting of the historic volatility of a peer group  the historic volatility of our own common stock and the implied volatility of our own common stock to estimate future volatility for stock option grants and we used the implied volatility of our own common stock to estimate the volatility for grants under our espp 
accrued liabilities as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued liabilities 
this process involves identifying goods received and services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued liabilities include the cost of marketing and promotional materials  contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations  clinical research organizations and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials  and professional service fees  such as fees to lawyers and accountants 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed 
to the extent that we do not 
table of contents identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments in accordance with the facts and circumstances known to us through our internal processes 
our internal processes require substantially all of our spending for services to be under contracts with our service providers and to be documented and tracked under internally generated purchase orders based on designated spending authorizations 
as of each balance sheet date  employees who are responsible for managing the contracts  and who are in contact with the outside service providers as to progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services  review current contracts and the related open purchase orders 
we adjust for spending not already reflected in our accounting records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
to date  there have been no material differences between the amounts of expenses accrued at our balance sheet dates and the amount at which such expenses were subsequently invoiced 
although we do not expect our current estimates to be materially different when invoiced  our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual timing and levels of service provided may vary and may result in adjustments in future periods 
income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  the amount and timing of which are uncertain 
based on available objective evidence  management believes it more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are not recognizable and will not be recognizable until we have sufficient taxable income 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
in the future  we may conclude that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets are realizable  and we will reverse the valuation allowance and recognize a related tax benefit at such time 
this determination depends on a variety of factors  some of which are subjective 
we have also provided for uncertain tax positions that we believe are not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued guidance which changes certain fair value measurement principles and increases disclosure requirements  particularly for fair value measurements subject to significant judgment and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june and december  the fasb issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements 
the amendment provides companies the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendment eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued amended guidance related to the goodwill impairment test which allows companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the amendment is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk except as the context otherwise requires  the following discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pertains to jazz pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries as of december  as of december   our exposure to market risk was confined to our cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which have maturities of less than one year and bear interest rates at variable rates and are denominated in  and pay interest in  us dollars 
the fair value of items exposed to market risk was million as of december  the goals of our investment policy are liquidity and capital preservation 
we limit our credit and liquidity risks through our investment policy and through regular reviews of our portfolio against our policy 
our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  consisted primarily of corporate debt securities  money market funds  obligations of us government agencies and certificates of deposit 
the effect of a basis point change in the average yield earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments would have the effect of increasing our interest income by less than million and  due to the nature of the investments  would not have had an impact on their fair value 
for additional information see note of the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of december   operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in currencies other than us dollars were insignificant
