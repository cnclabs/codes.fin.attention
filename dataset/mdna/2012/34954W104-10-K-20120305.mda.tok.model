this allows our clients to sell these services and products to their customers without having to establish their own insurance companies  which saves our clients the cost and time of undertaking and complying with substantial regulatory and licensing requirements 
our clients typically retain underwriting risk related to such products either through retrospective commission arrangements or fully collateralized reinsurance companies owned by them  which we administer on their behalf

our payment protection business generates service and administrative fees for distributing and administering payment protection products on behalf of our clients

com  inc ereinsure and south bay acceptance corporation south bay brands

bliss glennon  acquired in april  is one of the largest surplus lines brokers in california according to the surplus line association of california  and ranked in the top wholesale brokers in the united states in by premium volume according to business insurance  an industry publication 
the brokerage segment uses a wholesale model to sell specialty property and casualty p c and surplus lines insurance through retail insurance brokers and agents and insurance companies  as well as the placement of reinsurance risks on reinsurers 
we believe that our emphasis on customer service  rapid responsiveness to submissions and underwriting integrity in this segment has resulted in high customer satisfaction among retail insurance brokers and agents and insurance companies 
our brokerage business provides retail insurance brokers and agents and insurance companies the ability to obtain various types of commercial insurance coverages outside of their core areas of focus  broader access to insurance markets and the expertise to place complex risks

cirg was included in our brokerage segment 
in october  we acquired pbg  a leading us independent insurance agency 
pbg markets and sells health  accident  critical illness and life insurance policies 
pbg is headquartered in beaverton  or and is licensed as an agent in states 
in addition  pbg markets and sells our complementary products in connection with our plus one selling efforts and post point of sale on behalf of our business clients 
effective december   our payment protection subsidiary  life of the south insurance co 
lots  entered into an assumption reinsurance transaction with magna insurance company magna in which lots assumed all the outstanding liabilities for insurance policies underwritten by magna  including its credit  annuity and mortgage life policies 
the value of the insurance liabilities assumed  net of reinsurance was approximately million 
these policies are running off and no new policies are being underwritten 
effective december   we acquired magna from hancock holding company 
magna does not have any ongoing insurance business  but does have twelve state certificates of authority  which are redundant with certificates held by other fortegra subsidiaries 
we historically have used a combination of borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand to pay the purchase price of our acquisitions 
the following table summarizes our acquisition activity for the year ended in thousands  except number of acquisitions closed december  number of acquisitions closed total cash consideration market opportunity we operate in the insurance  consumer finance and commercial finance industries principally in the united states  offering our services and products through the brands and distribution bases of our clients 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on following key industry trends growth of outsourcing in the insurance industry 
by outsourcing business functions that can be more efficiently and cost effectively provided by specialized service providers  we believe that insurance companies can increase productivity  focus on core competencies and reduce operating costs 
according to celent  an independent research firm  the size of the north american insurance outsourcing market is expected to grow from approximately billion in to over billion in  representing a compounded annual growth rate of financial performance of financial services companies and retailers 
financial services companies and retailers offer complementary services and products  including payment protection and insurance related services and products  which we believe increase their revenues  enhance customer value and loyalty and improve their profitability 
according to the consumer credit industry association  net written premium for credit related insurance was billion in the united states in growth of the specialty property and casualty insurance market 
we believe the market for specialty p c insurance products has grown as a result of increased acceptance of these products by insured parties and the development of new risk management products by insurance carriers 
insurance carriers operating in the surplus lines market generally distribute their products through wholesale insurance brokers  such as bliss glennon 
according to am best  premiums written by surplus lines focused insurance carriers increased from billion to billion from to while this market fluctuates based on the trends generally affecting the insurance industry  we believe that demand for surplus lines insurance will increase if economic conditions in the united states improve 
our competitive strengths we believe the following to be the key strengths of our business model strong value proposition for our clients and their customers 
our solutions manage the essential aspects of insurance distribution and administration  providing low cost access to complex  often highly regulated markets  which we believe enables our clients to generate high margin  incremental revenues  enter new markets  mitigate risk  improve operating efficiencies and enhance customer loyalty 
proprietary technology and low cost operating platform 
our proprietary technology delivers low cost  highly automated services to our clients without significant up front investments and enables us to automate core business processes and reduce our clients operating costs 
scalability 
we believe that our scalable and flexible technology infrastructure  together with our highly trained and knowledgeable information technology personnel and consultants  enables us to add new clients and launch new services and products and expand our transaction volume quickly and easily without significant incremental expense 
high barriers to entry 
we believe that each of our businesses would be time consuming and expensive for new market participants to replicate due to the barriers to entry provided by our long term relationships with clients and other market participants and substantial experience in the markets that we serve 
experienced management team 
we have an experienced management team with extensive operating and industry experience in the markets that we serve 
our management team has successfully developed profitable new services and products and completed the acquisition of ten complementary businesses since january  while we believe these strengths will enable us to compete effectively  there are various risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
see item a 
risk factors  for a discussion on these factors 
key attributes of our business model we believe the following are the key attributes of our business model recurring revenue generation 
our business model  which includes the deployment of our technology with many of our clients  has historically generated substantial recurring revenues  high profit margins and significant operating cash flows 
long term relationships 
by delivering value added services and products to our clients customers  and offering fixed term contracts  we become an important part of our clients businesses and develop long term relationships 
wholesale distribution 
we provide most of our services and products to businesses on a wholesale basis enabling our clients to enhance their customer relationships and allowing us to take advantage of economies of scale 
business diversification 
our businesses and results of operations are highly diversified within the financial services industry  which positions us to take better advantage of emerging industry trends and to better manage business and insurance cycles than companies that operate in only one sector of the financial services industry 
our growth strategy we believe the following are the key contributors to our growth strategy provide high value solutions 
we continue to enhance our technologies and processes and focus on integrating our operations with those of our clients in order to provide our clients with services and products that will allow them to generate incremental revenues while reducing the costs of providing insurance and other financial products 
increase revenue from our existing clients 
we will seek to leverage our long standing relationships with our existing clients by providing them with additional services and products  introducing new services and products for them to market to their customers and establishing volume based fee arrangements 
expand client base in existing markets 
we intend to take advantage of business opportunities to develop new client relationships through our direct sales force  from referrals from existing clients and business partners  by responding to requests for proposals and through our participation in industry events 
enter new geographic markets 
we will look to expand our market presence in new geographic markets in the united states and internationally by broadening the jurisdictions in which we operate  hiring new employees  opening new offices  seeking additional licenses and regulatory approvals and pursuing acquisition opportunities 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
we plan to continue pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses to expand our service offerings  access new markets and expand our client base 
competition our businesses focus on niche segments within broader insurance markets 
while we face competition in each of our businesses  we believe that no single competitor competes against us in all of our segments and the markets in which we operate are generally characterized by a limited number of competitors 
competition in our operating segments is based on many factors  including price  industry knowledge  quality of client service  the effectiveness of our sales force  technology platforms and processes  the security and integrity of our information systems  the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries  office locations  breadth of products and services and brand recognition and reputation 
some competitors may offer a broader array of services and products  may have a greater diversity of distribution resources  may have a better brand recognition  may have lower cost structures or  with respect to insurers  may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings 
some competitors also have larger client bases than we do 
in addition  new competitors could enter our markets in the future 
the relative importance of these factors varies by product and market 
the competitive landscape for each of our business segments is described below 
in our payment protection business  we compete with insurance companies  financial institutions and other insurance service providers 
the principal competitors for our payment protection business include the payment protection groups of aon corporation  assurant  inc  asurion corporation and smaller regional companies 
as a result of state and federal regulatory developments and changes in prior years  certain financial institutions are able to offer debt cancellation plans and are also able to affiliate with other insurance companies in order to offer services similar to those in our payment protection business 
as financial institutions gain experience with payment protection programs  their reliance on our services and products may diminish 
our bpo business competes with a variety of companies  including large multinational firms that provide consulting  technology and or business process services  off shore business process service providers in low cost locations like india  and in house captive insurance companies of potential clients 
our principal business process outsourcing competitors include aon corporation  computer sciences corporation  direct response insurance administrative services  inc  marsh mclennan companies  inc  dell services and unisys corporation 
the trend toward outsourcing and technological changes may also result in new and different competitors entering our markets 
there could also be newer competitors with strong competitive positions as a result of strategic consolidation of smaller competitors or of companies that each provide different services or serve different industries 
in addition  a client or potential client may choose not to outsource its business  including by setting up captive outsourcing operations or by performing formerly outsourced services themselves 
our brokerage business competes with numerous firms for retail insurance clients  including amwins group  inc  arthur j 
gallagher co  brown brown  inc and the swett crawford group  inc 
many of our brokerage competitors have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us 
because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature  this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of california 
this could also impact our ability to compete effectively in any new states or regions that we enter 
a number of standard market insurance companies are engaged in the sale of products that compete with those products we offer 
these carriers sell their products directly through retail agents and brokers  without the involvement of a wholesale broker  which may yield higher commissions to retail agents and brokers and may impact our ability to compete 
in addition  the internet continues to evolve as a source for direct placement of personal lines insurance business 
we are also uniquely positioned in the facultative reinsurance marketplace with no comparable companies currently providing similar services 
systems such as aon s faconnect  the lexisnexis insurance exchange and the lloyd s exchange have technology platforms that could provide solutions which could directly compete with us in the future 
in addition  the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate 
as a result  the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation  which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions  including competition for acquisition prospects 
regulation we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  and its rules and regulations  which requires us to file reports  proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec 
our payment protection  bpo and brokerage businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision  including at the federal  state  local and foreign level 
we cannot predict the impact of future changes to such laws or regulations on our business 
future laws and regulations  or the interpretation thereof  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
payment protection state regulation our insurance operations and subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business 
state insurance laws and regulations regulate most aspects of our insurance businesses  and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
our non us insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled ie  turks and caicos 
our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by us federal  state and local tax laws  and the tax laws of us jurisdictions 
the extent of us state insurance regulation varies  but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state 
the purpose of the laws and regulation affecting our insurance operations is primarily to protect the policyholders and not our stockholders or our agents ie  the financial institutions that sell our products to their customers 
the regulation  supervision and administration by state departments of insurance relate  among other things  to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained  the payment of dividends  changes in control of insurance companies  the licensing of insurers and their agents and other producers  the types of insurance that may be written  privacy practices  the ability to enter and exit certain insurance markets  the nature of and limitations on investments and premium rates  or restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy  reserves and provisions for unearned premiums  losses and other obligations  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  payment of sales compensation to third parties  approval of policy forms  and the regulation of market conduct  including underwriting and claims practices insurance holding company statutes 
as a holding company  we are not regulated as an insurance company  but because we own capital stock in insurance subsidiaries  we are subject to the state insurance holding company statutes  as well as certain other laws of each of the states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries 
all holding company statutes  as well as other laws  require disclosure and in many instances  prior regulatory approval of material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate 
the holding company statutes as well as other laws also require  among other things  prior regulatory approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer  certain transactions between affiliates and payments of extraordinary dividends or distributions 
transactions within the holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and reasonable  and each insurer s policyholder surplus following any such transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs 
dividends limitations 
we are a holding company and have limited direct operations 
our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries  including statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries  as well as payments under our tax allocation agreement and management agreements with our subsidiaries 
the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled  which vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company 
along with solvency regulations  the primary factor in determining the amount of capital available for potential dividends is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from am best for our insurance company subsidiaries 
given recent economic events that have affected the insurance industry  both regulators and rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria  including increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries which  in turn  could negatively affect our capital resources 
the following table sets forth the dividends paid to us by our insurance company subsidiaries for the following periods years ended december  in thousands ordinary dividends extraordinary dividends total dividends regulation of investments 
our insurance company subsidiaries must comply with their respective state of domicile s laws regulating insurance company investments 
these laws prescribe the kind  quality and concentration of investments and while unique to each state  the laws are modeled on the standards promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
such investment laws are generally permissive with respect to federal  state and municipal obligations  and more restrictive with respect to corporate obligations  particularly non investment grade obligations  foreign investment  equity securities and real estate investments 
each insurance company is therefore limited by the investment laws of its state of domicile from making excessive investments in any given security such as single issuer limitations or in certain classes or riskier investments such as aggregate limitation in non investment grade bonds 
the diversification requirements are broadly consistent with our investment strategies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non admitted assets for the purpose of measuring surplus  and  in some instances  would require divestiture of such non complying investments 
we believe the investments made by our insurance subsidiaries comply with these laws and regulations 
risk based capital requirements 
the naic has adopted a model act with risk based capital rbc formulas to be applied to insurance companies 
rbc is a method of measuring the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
rbc standards are used by state insurance regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions 
the domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries have adopted laws substantially similar to the naic s rbc model act 
rbc requirements determine minimum capital requirements and are intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations 
rbc levels are not intended as a measure to rank insurers generally  and the insurance laws in our domiciliary states generally restrict the public dissemination of insurers rbc levels 
under laws adopted by individual states  insurers having total adjusted capital less than that required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
federal regulation dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  which implements comprehensive changes to the regulatory landscape of financial services in the us many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rule making and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on our business  our customers or the insurance and financial services industries 
in addition  congress created the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb 
while the cfpb does not have direct jurisdiction over insurance products  it is possible that regulations promulgated by the cfpb may extend its authority to cover these products and thereby potentially affecting the company s business or the clients that we serve 
gramm leach bliley act 
on november   the gramm leach bliley act of became law  implementing fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry in the united states 
the gramm leach bliley act permits the transformation of the already converging banking  insurance and securities industries by permitting mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms under one holding company 
under the gramm leach bliley act  community banks retain their existing ability to sell insurance products in some circumstances 
privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act became fully effective in these provisions established consumer protections regarding the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information and  as implemented through state insurance laws and regulations  require us to make full disclosure of our privacy policies to customers 
health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
through hipaa  the department of health and human services imposes obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors 
hipaa established requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information and new standards for electronic health care transactions 
the department of health and human services promulgated final hipaa regulations in the privacy regulations required compliance by april  the electronic transactions regulations by october and the security regulations by april recently  parts of hipaa were amended under the hitech act  and pursuant to these amendments  new regulations have been issued requiring notification of government agencies and consumers in the event of certain security breaches involving personal health information 
hipaa is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve 
consequently  our efforts to measure  monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with hipaa are ongoing 
failure to comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits 
knowing and intentional violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal penalties 
foreign jurisdictions 
a portion of our business is ceded to our reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in turks and caicos 
those subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements  such as filing annual financial statements  filing annual certificates of compliance and paying annual fees 
if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable laws  rules and regulations  the licenses issued by the regulatory authority in turks and caicos could be subject to modification or revocation  and our subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business 
bpo we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  particularly related to our administration of insurance products on behalf of other insurers 
in order for us to process and administer insurance products of other companies  we are required to maintain licenses of a third party administrator in the states where those insurance companies operate 
with regard to our third party administration operations  we also must comply with the related federal and state privacy laws that similarly apply to our insurance operations 
we are also subject to laws and regulations on direct marketing  such as the telemarketing consumer fraud and abuse prevention act and the telemarketing sales rule  the telephone consumer protection act  the do not call implementation act and rules promulgated by the federal communications commission and the federal trade commission and the can spam act 
failure to comply with the provisions of such acts and rules could result in fines and penalties 
as a business process outsourcer for insurers and financial institutions  we are subject to data protection and privacy laws  such as the gramm leach bliley act as well as hipaa and certain state data privacy laws 
in addition  the terms of our contracts typically require us to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
if we fail to comply with any applicable laws or regulations  we may be restricted in our ability to provide services and may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties  litigation as well as contract termination 
brokerage our brokerage and premium finance operations are subject to regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
bliss glennon and our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents  brokers  producers and or agencies by state regulatory authorities in the states where we conduct business 
regulations and licensing laws vary by state and are often complex and subject to interpretation and enforcement by the relevant departments of insurance 
laws and regulations vary from state to state and are always subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities 
these authorities have substantial discretion as to the decision to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals 
our continuing ability to do business in the states in which we currently operate depends on the validity of and continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which we operate 
more restrictive laws  rules or regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult and expensive or adversely affect our business

risk factors of this annual report under risks related to regulatory and legal matters we are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations  which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 
seasonality our financial results may be affected by seasonal variations 
revenues in our payment protection business may fluctuate seasonally based on consumer spending trends  where consumer spending has historically been higher in september and december  corresponding to back to school and the holiday season 
accordingly  our payment protection revenues may reflect higher third and fourth quarters than in the first half of the year 
revenues in our brokerage business may fluctuate seasonally based on policy renewal dates  which are typically concentrated in july and december  the months during our third and fourth quarters 
in addition  our quarterly revenues may be affected by new placements  cancellations or non renewals of large policies because commission revenues are earned on the effective date as opposed to ratably over the year 
our quarterly brokerage revenues may also be affected by the amount of profit commissions received from insurance carriers  since profit commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year 
employees at december   we employed approximately people on a full or part time basis 
none of our employees are represented by unions or trade organizations 
we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
intellectual property we own or license a number of trademarks  trade names  copyrights  service marks  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that relate to our services and products 
although we believe that these intellectual property rights are  in the aggregate  of material importance to our businesses  we believe that none of our businesses are materially dependent upon any particular trademark  trade name  copyright  service mark  license or other intellectual property right 
us trademark and service mark registrations are generally for a term of years  renewable every years as long as the trademark or service mark is used in the regular course of trade 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our clients

additional risks unknown at this time  or risks we currently deem immaterial  may also impact our financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our business and industries general economic and financial market conditions may have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition of all of our business segments 
general economic and financial market conditions  including the availability and cost of credit  the loss of consumer confidence  reduction in consumer or business spending  inflation  unemployment  energy costs and geopolitical issues  have contributed to increased uncertainty and volatility as well as diminished expectations for the us economy and the financial markets 
these conditions could materially and adversely affect each of our businesses 
adverse economic and financial market conditions could result in a reduction in the demand for  and availability of  consumer credit  which could result in reduced demand by consumers for our payment protection products and our payment protection clients opting to no longer make such products available higher than anticipated loss ratios on our payment protection products due to rising unemployment or disability claims  higher risk of increased fraudulent insurance claims  individuals terminating loans or canceling credit insurance policies  thereby reducing our revenues  businesses reducing the amount of coverage under surplus lines and specialty admitted insurance policies or allowing such policies to lapse thereby reducing our premium or commission income in our brokerage business  a reduction in demand for new surplus lines and specialty insurance policies from retail insurance brokers and agents or retail insurance brokers and agents and insurance companies ceasing to offer our surplus lines and specialty insurance products and related services from our brokerage business  a contraction in the reinsurance market caused by reduced demand by major insurers  reduced supply by reinsurers or other factors or reduced reinsurance demand by our insurance customers due to market conditions  our clients being more likely to experience financial distress or declare bankruptcy or liquidation  which could have an adverse impact on demand for our services and products and the remittance of premiums from such customers  as well as the collection of receivables from such clients for items such as unearned premiums  commissions or bpo related accounts receivable  which could make the collection of receivables from our clients more difficult  increased pricing sensitivity or reduced demand for our services and products  increased costs associated with  or the inability to obtain  debt financing to fund acquisitions or the expansion of our businesses  and defaults in our fixed income investment portfolio or lower than anticipated rates of return as a result of low interest rate environments 
if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic or financial market conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to such changes  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face significant competition in each of our businesses 
competition in our businesses is based on many factors  including price  industry knowledge  quality of client service  the effectiveness of our sales force  technology platforms and processes  the security and integrity of our information systems  the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries  office locations  breadth of services and products and brand recognition and reputation 
some competitors may offer a broader array of services and products  may have a greater diversity of distribution resources  may have better brand recognition  may have lower cost structures or  with respect to insurers  may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings 
some competitors also have larger client bases than we do 
in addition  new competitors could enter our markets in the future 
the competitive landscape for each of our businesses is described below 
payment protection in our payment protection business  we compete with insurance companies  financial institutions and other insurance service providers 
the principal competitors for our payment protection business include aon corporation  assurant  inc  asurion corporation and smaller regional companies 
as a result of state and federal regulatory developments and changes in prior years  certain financial institutions are able to offer debt cancellation plans and are also able to affiliate with other insurance companies in order to offer services similar to those in our payment protection business 
this has resulted in new competitors  some of whom have significant financial resources  entering some of our markets 
as financial institutions gain experience with payment protection programs  their reliance on our services and products may diminish 
bpo our bpo business competes with a variety of companies  including large multinational firms that provide consulting  technology and or business process services  off shore business process service providers in low cost locations like india  and in house captive insurance companies of potential clients 
our principal business process outsourcing competitors include aon corporation  computer sciences corporation  direct response insurance administrative services  inc  marsh mclennan companies  inc  dell services and unisys corporation 
the trend toward outsourcing and technological changes may also result in new and different competitors entering our markets 
there could also be newer competitors with strong competitive positions as a result of consolidation of smaller competitors or of companies that each provide different services or serve different industries 
brokerage our brokerage business competes for retail insurance clients with numerous firms  including amwins group  inc  arthur j 
gallagher co  brown brown  inc and the swett crawford group  inc many of our brokerage competitors have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us 
because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature  this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of california 
this could also impact our ability to compete effectively in any new states or regions that we enter 
a number of standard market insurance companies are engaged in the sale of products that compete with those products we offer 
these carriers sell their products directly through retail agents and brokers without the involvement of a wholesale broker  which may yield higher commissions to retail agents and brokers and may impact our ability to compete 
we are also uniquely positioned in the facultative reinsurance marketplace with no comparable companies currently providing similar services 
systems such as aon s faconnect  the lexisnexis insurance exchange and the lloyd s exchange have technology platforms that could provide solutions which could directly compete with us in the future 
we expect competition to intensify in each of our businesses 
increased competition may result in lower prices and volumes  higher personnel and sales and marketing costs  increased technology expenditures and lower profitability 
we may not be able to supply clients with services or products that they deem superior and at competitive prices and we may lose business to our competitors 
if we are unable to compete effectively in any of our business segments  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly  which makes our future results of operations difficult to predict 
if our results of operations fall below expectations  the price of our common stock could decline 
our annual and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  our expenses as a percentage of revenues may be significantly different than our historical rates 
as a result  comparing our results of operations on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period include demand for our services and products  the length of our sales cycle  the amount of sales to new clients the timing of implementations of our services and products with new clients  pricing and availability of surplus lines and other specialty insurance products coverages  seasonality  the timing of acquisitions  competitive factors  prevailing interest rates  pricing changes by us or our competitors  transaction volumes in our clients businesses  the introduction of new services and products by us and our competitors  changes in regulatory and accounting standards  and our ability to control costs 
in addition  our payment protection revenues can vary depending on the level of consumer activity and the success of our clients in selling payment protection products 
in our brokerage business  our commission and fee income can vary due to the timing of policy renewals  as well as the timing and amount of the receipt of profit commission payments and fees and the net effect of new and lost business production 
we do not control the factors that cause these variations 
specifically  customers demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals  new business  lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations 
in addition  we rely on retail insurance brokers and agents and insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions 
because these payments are processed internally by these companies  we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular firm in one period until after the end of that period  which can adversely affect our ability to budget for such period 
our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to retain our existing clients  cannot sell additional services and products to our existing clients  do not introduce new or enhanced services and products or are not able to attract and retain new clients 
our revenue and revenue growth are dependent on our ability to retain clients  to sell them additional services and products  to introduce new services and products and to attract new clients in each of our businesses 
our ability to increase revenues will depend on a variety of factors  including the quality and perceived value of our product and service offerings by existing and new clients  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  the speed with which our brokerage business can respond to requests for price quotes from retail insurance agents and brokers  and the availability of competitive services and products from our carriers  the successful installation and implementation of our services and products for new and existing payment protection and bpo clients  availability of capital to complete investments in new or complementary products  services and technologies  the availability of adequate reinsurance for us and our clients  including the ability of our clients to form  capitalize and operate captive reinsurance companies  our ability to find suitable acquisition candidates  successfully complete such acquisitions and effectively integrate such acquisitions  our ability to integrate technology into our services and products to avoid obsolescence and provide scalability  the reliability  execution and accuracy of our services  particularly our bpo services  and client willingness to accept any price increases for our services and products 
in addition  we are subject to risks of losing clients due to consolidation in each of the markets we serve 
our inability to retain existing clients  sell additional services and products  or successfully develop and implement new and enhanced services and products and attract new clients and  accordingly  increase our revenues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new clients in each of our businesses as well as long implementation periods that require significant resource commitments  which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new client relationships 
the industries in which we compete generally consist of mature businesses and markets and the companies that participate in these industries have well established business operations  systems and relationships 
accordingly  each of our businesses typically faces a long selling cycle to secure a new client 
even if we are successful in obtaining a new client engagement  it is generally followed by a long implementation period in which the services are planned in detail and we demonstrate to the client that we can successfully integrate our processes and resources with their operations 
we also typically negotiate and enter into a contractual relationship with the new client during this period 
there is then a long implementation period in order to commence providing the services 
we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle 
we may not succeed in winning a new client s business  in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses 
even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential client and begin to plan the services in detail  such potential client may choose a competitor or decide to retain the work in house prior to the time a final contract is signed 
if we enter into a contract with a client  we will typically receive no revenues until implementation actually begins 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenue is based upon the success of our clients marketing programs  which may not generate the transaction volume we anticipate 
our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations  thereby further lengthening the implementation cycle 
if we are not successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle  in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle or in maintaining or reducing the duration of unprofitable initial periods in our contracts  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the time and effort required to complete the implementation phases of new contracts makes it difficult to accurately predict the timing of revenues from new clients as well as our costs 
acquisitions are a significant part of our growth strategy and we may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates  completing such acquisitions or integrating the acquired businesses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or growth 
historically  acquisitions have played a significant role in our expansion into new businesses and in the growth of some of our businesses 
acquiring complementary businesses is a significant component of our growth strategy 
accordingly  we frequently evaluate possible acquisition transactions for our business 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisitions  and such transactions may not be financed and completed on acceptable terms 
we may incur significant expenses in evaluating such acquisitions 
furthermore  any future acquisitions may not be successful 
in addition  we may be competing with larger competitors with substantially greater resources for acquisition targets 
any deficiencies in the process of integrating companies we may acquire could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions entail a number of risks including  among other things failure to achieve anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flow  increased expenses  diversion of management time and attention  failure to retain the acquired business customers or personnel  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies ability to realize synergies and cost savings  difficulties in integrating systems and personnel  and inaccurate assessment of liabilities 
our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and growth 
future acquisitions may reduce our cash resources available to fund our operations and capital expenditures and could result in increased amortization expense related to any intangible assets acquired  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  which could increase our interest expense 
our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity may be materially and adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
we are subject to various actual and potential claims  lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with our conduct in each of our businesses  including the handling and adjudicating of claims and the placement of insurance 
because such placement of insurance and handling claims can involve substantial amounts of money  clients may assert errors and omissions claims against us alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question 
claimants may seek large damage awards  and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs 
such claims  lawsuits and other proceedings could  for example  include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub agents improperly failed to procure coverage  report claims on behalf of clients  provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis 
while we would expect most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our self insured deductibles to be covered by our professional indemnity insurance  our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected if  in the future  our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable  or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure 
our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be materially and adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
we may lose clients or business as a result of consolidation within the financial services industry 
there has been considerable consolidation in the financial services industry  driven primarily by the acquisition of small and mid size organizations by larger entities 
we expect this trend to continue 
as a result  we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues from retail insurance brokerage firms that are acquired by other firms 
similarly  we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues if one or more of our payment protection clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies 
to date  our business has not been materially affected by consolidation 
however  we may be affected by industry consolidation that occurs in the future  particularly if any of our significant clients are acquired by organizations that already possess the operations  services and products that we provide 
our ability to implement and execute our strategic plans may not be successful and  accordingly  we may not be successful in achieving our strategic goals  which may materially and adversely affect our business 
we may not be successful in developing and implementing our strategic plans for our businesses or the operational plans that have been or need to be developed to implement these strategic plans 
if the development or implementation of such plans is not successful  we may not produce the revenue  margins  earnings or synergies that we need to be successful 
we may also face delays or difficulties in implementing service  product  process and system improvements  which could adversely affect the timing or effectiveness of margin improvement efforts in our businesses and our ability to successfully compete in the markets we serve 
the execution of our strategic and operating plans will  to some extent  also be dependent on external factors that we cannot control 
in addition  these strategic and operational plans need to continue to be assessed and reassessed to meet the challenges and needs of our businesses in order for us to remain competitive 
the failure to implement and execute our strategic and operating plans in a timely manner or at all  realize the cost savings or other benefits or improvements associated with such plans  have financial resources to fund the costs associated with such plans or incur costs in excess of anticipated amounts  or sufficiently assess and reassess these plans could have a material and adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we may not effectively manage our growth  which could materially harm our business 
the growth of our business has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management  personnel  systems and resources 
to manage our growth  we must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures  and we will need to continue to expand  train and manage our personnel 
we must also maintain close coordination among our technology  compliance  legal  risk management  accounting  finance  marketing and sales organizations 
we may not manage our growth effectively  and if we fail to do so  our business could be materially and adversely harmed 
if we continue to grow  we may be required to increase our investment in facilities  personnel and financial and management systems and controls 
continued growth  especially in connection with expansion into new business lines  may also require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and that we recruit  integrate  train and manage a growing employee base 
the expansion of our existing businesses  our expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes that are more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required 
we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary 
further  unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth  our operating margins and profitability will be materially and adversely affected 
as a holding company  we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations 
we act as a holding company for our subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of our own 
dividends from our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to meet our obligations and pay dividends  if any  on our common stock 
these obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal payments on our current and any future borrowings 
the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities restrict our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or otherwise transfer cash to us 
under our revolving credit facility  our subsidiaries are permitted to make distributions to us if no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such distribution 
if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividends or otherwise is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations  or if a subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us  we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of additional debt  the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets 
the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by each of the regulated insurance company subsidiaries in our payment protection segment is regulated by insurance laws and regulations of the states in which they operate 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
ordinary dividends  for which no regulatory approval is generally required  are limited to amounts determined by a formula  which varies by state 
some states have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus 
states also regulate transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries  such as those relating to the shared services  and in some instances  require prior approval of such transactions within the holding company structure 
if insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us such as payments for employee or other services would be adverse to policyholders or creditors  the regulators may block or otherwise restrict such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval 
in addition  there could be future regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or share services 
our success is dependent upon the retention and acquisition of talented people and the skills and abilities of our management team and key personnel 
our business depends on the efforts  abilities and expertise of our senior executives  particularly our chairman  president and chief executive officer  richard s 
kahlbaugh 
mr 
kahlbaugh and our other senior executives are important to our success because they have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction  operating our business  identifying  recruiting and training key personnel  maintaining relationships with our clients  and identifying business opportunities 
the loss of one or more of these key individuals could impair our business and development until qualified replacements are found 
we may not be able to replace these individuals quickly or with persons of equal experience and capabilities 
although we have employment agreements with certain of these individuals  we cannot prevent them from terminating their employment with us 
in addition  our non compete agreements with such individuals may not be enforced by the courts 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers except for mr 
kahlbaugh 
if we are unable to attract and retain talented employees  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  but there is no assurance that such capital will be available on a timely basis  on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our businesses or fund our strategy or acquisitions 
additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders if raised through additional equity offerings 
a significant portion of our funding is under our revolving credit facility  which matures in june additionally  any securities issued to raise such funds may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  our ability to expand  develop or enhance our services and products  enter new markets  consummate acquisitions or respond to competitive pressures could be materially limited 
risks related to our payment protection business our payment protection business relies on independent financial institutions  lenders and retailers to distribute its services and products  and the loss of these distribution sources  or the failure of our distribution sources to sell our payment protection products could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we distribute our payment protection products through financial institutions  lenders and retailers 
although our contracts with these clients are typically exclusive  they can be canceled on relatively short notice 
in addition  the distributors typically do not have any minimum performance or sales requirements and our payment protection revenue is dependent on the level of business conducted by the distributor as well as the effectiveness of their sales efforts for our payment protection products  each of which is beyond our control 
the impairment of our distribution relationships  the loss of a significant number of our distribution relationships  the failure to establish new distribution relationships  the increase in sales of competitors services and products by these distributors or the decline in their overall business activity or the effectiveness of their sales of our payment protection products could materially reduce our payment protection sales and revenues 
also  the growth of our payment protection business is dependent in part on our ability to identify  attract and retain new distribution relationships and successfully implement our information systems with those of our new distributors 
reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses  and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for a substantial portion of the risks underwritten by our payment protection business through captive reinsurance companies owned by our payment protection clients as well as third party reinsurance companies 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to renew or purchase 
our clients may face difficulties forming  capitalizing and operating captive reinsurance companies  which could impact their ability to reinsure future business that we typically cede to them 
states also could impose restrictions on these reinsurance arrangements  such as requiring the insurance company subsidiary to retain a minimum amount of underwriting risk  which could affect our profitability and results of operations 
reinsurance for certain types of catastrophes generally could become unavailable or prohibitively expensive for some of our businesses 
such changes could substantially increase our exposure to the risk of significant losses from natural or man made catastrophes and could hinder our ability to write future business 
although the reinsurer is liable to the respective insurance subsidiary to the extent of the ceded reinsurance  the insurance company remains liable to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
ceded reinsurance arrangements  therefore  do not eliminate our insurance company obligation to pay claims 
while the captive reinsurance companies owned by our clients are generally required to maintain trust accounts with sufficient assets to cover the reinsurance liabilities and we manage these trust accounts on behalf of these reinsurance companies  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
the inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and our clients may not be able to continue to operate their captive reinsurance companies 
as a result  even where highly desirable or necessary  we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain or structure new reinsurance facilities  either our net exposures would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures  we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
either of these potential developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the structure of some of our commissions  we are exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness of some of our agents 
we are subject to the credit risk of some of the agents with which we contract within our payment protection business 
we typically advance agents commissions as part of our product offerings 
these advances are a percentage of the premium charged 
if we over advance such commissions to agents  they may not be able to fulfill their payback obligations  and it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a downgrade in the ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries may materially and adversely affect relationships with clients and adversely affect our results of operations 
claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are each a factor in establishing the competitive position of our insurance company subsidiaries 
a ratings downgrade  or the potential for such a downgrade  could  among other things  materially and adversely affect relationships with clients  brokers and other distributors of our services and products  thereby negatively impacting our results of operations  and materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in our markets 
rating agencies can be expected to continue to monitor our financial strength and claims paying ability  and no assurances can be given that future ratings downgrades will not occur  whether due to changes in our performance  changes in rating agencies industry views or ratings methodologies  or a combination of such factors 
our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims  which may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially and adversely reduce our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported claims as of the end of each accounting period 
reserves  whether calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or statutory accounting principles  do not represent an exact calculation of exposure 
instead  they represent our best estimates  generally involving actuarial projections  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for a claim or group of claims  based on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation 
the adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
these variables are affected by external factors such as changes in the economic cycle  unemployment  changes in the social perception of the value of work  emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability  emerging health issues  new methods of treatment or accommodation  inflation  judicial trends  legislative changes  as well as changes in claims handling procedures 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
reserve estimates are refined as experience develops 
adjustments to reserves  both positive and negative  are reflected in the statement of income of the period in which such estimates are updated 
because the establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses  we can give no assurances that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves 
in general  future loss development could require reserves to be increased  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the fair value of our invested assets and cash and may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability 
investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability and significant interest rate fluctuations  or prolonged periods of low interest rates  could impair our profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
we have a significant portion of our investments in cash and highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  during prolonged periods of declining or low market interest rates  such as those we have been experiencing since  the interest we receive on such investments decreases and affects our profitability 
in addition  certain factors affecting our business  such as volatility of claims experience  could force us to liquidate securities prior to maturity  causing us to incur capital losses 
if we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities 
the fair value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
because all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair value of these securities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
we employ asset liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility and to increase the likelihood that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due 
our asset liability management strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility  and significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio  primarily from our investments in corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses 
the fair value of our investments may be materially and adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades in the corporate bonds included in the portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other than temporary impairments 
each of these events may cause us to reduce the fair value of our investment portfolio 
further  the fair value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of a given issuer 
our fixed maturity portfolio may include below investment grade securities rated bb or lower by nationally recognized securities rating organizations 
these investments generally provide higher expected returns  but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities 
a significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our bpo business a significant portion of our bpo revenues are attributable to one client  and any loss of business from  or change in our relationship with this client could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have derived and are likely to continue to derive a significant portion of our bpo revenues from a limited number of clients  specifically  in our bpo business  services provided to national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh  pa nufic 
see the section quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration risk in this report  regarding our concentration risk 
the loss of business or a reduction in the fees or other change in relationship with any of our significant clients  particularly nufic  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the profitability of our bpo business will suffer if we are not able to price our outsourcing services appropriately  maintain asset utilization levels and control our costs 
the profitability of our bpo business is largely a function of the efficiency with which we utilize our assets and the pricing that we are able to obtain for our services 
our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including hiring and assimilating new employees  forecasting demand for our services and our need to devote time and resources to training  professional development and other typically non chargeable activities 
the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors  including our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  competition  the introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors and general economic conditions 
our ability to accurately estimate  attain and sustain revenues over increasingly longer contract periods could negatively impact our margins and cash flows 
therefore  if we are unable to price appropriately or manage our asset utilization levels  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the profitability of our bpo business is also a function of our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency 
as we increase the number of our employees and grow our business  we may not be able to manage the significantly larger workforce that may result and our profitability may not improve 
we enter into fixed term contracts and per unit priced contracts with our bpo clients  and our failure to correctly price these contracts may negatively affect our profitability 
the pricing of our services is usually included in contracts entered into with our clients  many of which are for terms of between one and three years 
in certain cases  we have committed to pricing over this period with only limited sharing of risk regarding inflation 
if we fail to estimate accurately future wage inflation rates or our costs  or if we fail to accurately estimate the productivity benefits we can achieve under a contract  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
some of our bpo contracts contain provisions which  if triggered  could result in the payment of penalties or lower future revenues and could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of our bpo contracts contain service level and performance provisions  including standards relating to the quality of our services  that would provide our clients with the right to terminate their contract if we do not meet pre agreed service level requirements and in the case of our contract with nufic  require us to pay penalties 
our contract with nufic also provides that  during the term of the contract and for months thereafter  we may not develop or service products for nufic s competitors that are substantially similar to those we administer on behalf of nufic 
failure to meet these requirements could result in the payment of significant penalties by us to our clients which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our brokerage business we may not be able to accurately forecast our brokerage commissions and fees revenues because our commissions and fees depend on premiums charged by insurance companies  which historically have varied and  as a result  have been difficult to predict 
our brokerage business derives revenue principally from commissions and fees paid by insurance companies 
commissions and fees are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products 
the amount of such commissions and fees are therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies 
we do not determine insurance premium rates 
premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market and in many cases are regulated by the states in which they operate 
we have generally encountered declining rates for property and casualty insurance since late premium pricing within the commercial property and casualty insurance market in which we operate historically has been cyclical based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance carriers operating in this market and has been impacted by general economic conditions 
in a period of decreasing insurance capacity  insurance carriers typically raise premium rates 
this type of market frequently is referred to as a hard market 
in a period of increasing insurance capacity  insurance carriers tend to reduce premium rates 
this type of market frequently is referred to as a soft market  which the commercial p c market has been experiencing since because our commission rates usually are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium charged for the insurance products that we place  our revenues are affected by the pricing cycle of the market and the amount of risk that is insured 
general economic conditions may impact the amount of risk that is insured by companies by affecting the value of the insured properties  the size of company workforces and the willingness of companies to self insure certain risks to reduce insurance expenses 
the frequency and severity of natural disasters and other catastrophic events can affect the timing  duration and extent of industry cycles for many of the product lines we distribute 
it is very difficult to predict the severity  timing or duration of these cycles 
the cyclical nature of premium pricing in the commercial property and casualty insurance market may make our results of operations volatile and unpredictable 
to the extent that an economic downturn and or soft market persists for an extended period of time  our brokerage commissions and fees  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
we may experience reductions in the commission revenues we receive from risk bearing insurance companies as these insurance companies seek to reduce their expenses by reducing commission rates payable to non affiliated brokers or agents such as us  which may significantly affect the profitability of our brokerage business 
as traditional risk bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenues to non affiliated brokers or agents such as us  those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers 
the reduction of these commission rates  along with general volatility and or declines in premiums  may significantly affect the profitability of our brokerage business 
because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes  we may not be able to accurately forecast our commission revenues  including whether they will significantly decline 
as a result  we may have to adjust our budgets to account for unexpected changes in revenues  and any decreases in premium rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the loss of the services of any of our highly qualified brokers could harm our business and operating results 
our future performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly qualified brokers  including brokers who work in the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 
competition for productive brokers is intense  and our inability to recruit or retain these brokers could harm our business and operating results 
while many of our senior brokers own an equity interest in us and many have entered into employment agreements with us  these brokers may not serve the term of their employment agreements or renew their employment agreements upon expiration 
moreover  any of the brokers who leave our firm may not comply with the provisions of their employment agreements that preclude them from competing with us or soliciting our customers and employees  or these provisions may not be enforceable under applicable law or sufficient to protect us from the loss of any business 
in addition  we do not have employment  non competition or non solicitation agreements with all of our brokers 
we may not be able to retain or replace the business generated by a broker who leaves our firm or replace that broker with an equally qualified broker who is acceptable to our clients 
because our brokerage business is highly concentrated in california  adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in that state could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a significant portion of our brokerage business is concentrated in california 
we believe the regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in california currently is no more restrictive than in other states 
the insurance business is a state regulated industry  and therefore  state legislatures may enact laws  and state insurance regulators may adopt regulations  that adversely affect the profitability of insurance industries in their states 
because our brokerage business is concentrated in a few states  we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states 
in addition  the occurrence of adverse economic conditions  natural or other disasters  or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if insurance carriers begin to transact business without relying on wholesale insurance brokers  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
our brokerage business acts as an intermediary between retail agents and insurance carriers that  in some cases  will not transact business directly with retail insurance brokers and agents 
if insurance carriers change the way they conduct business and begin to transact business with retail agents without including us or if retail agents are enabled to transact business directly with insurance carriers as a result of changes in the surplus lines and specialty insurance markets  technological advancements or other factors  our role in the distribution of surplus lines and specialty insurance products could be eliminated or substantially reduced  and our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
in addition  if insurers retain more risk or cede risks that have traditionally been placed facultatively to treaty reinsurance arrangements  then revenue and cash flow attributable to ereinsure could suffer 
our growth strategy may involve opening or acquiring new offices and expanding internationally and will involve hiring new brokers and underwriters for our brokerage business  which will require substantial investment by us and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to grow our brokerage business organically depends in part on our ability to open or acquire new offices  expand internationally and recruit new brokers and underwriters 
we may not be successful in any efforts to open new offices  expand internationally or hire new brokers or underwriters 
the costs of opening a new office  expanding internationally and hiring the necessary personnel to staff the office can be substantial  and we often are required to commit to multi year  non cancelable lease agreements 
it has been our experience that our new brokerage offices may not achieve profitability on a stand alone basis until they have been in operation for at least three years 
in addition  we often hire new brokers and underwriters with the expectation that they will not become profitable until months after they are hired 
the cost of investing in new offices  brokers and underwriters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
moreover  we may not be able to recover our investments or these offices  brokers and underwriters may not achieve profitability 
our financial results may be materially and adversely affected by the occurrence of catastrophes 
portions of our brokerage business involve the placement of insurance policies that cover losses from unpredictable events such as hurricanes  windstorms  hailstorms  earthquakes  fires  industrial explosions  freezes  riots  floods and other man made or natural disasters  including acts of terrorism 
the incidence and severity of these catastrophes in any given period are inherently unpredictable  and climate change could further exacerbate the severity and frequency of weather related events 
we are generally eligible to earn profit commissions  which are commissions we receive from carriers based upon the ultimate profitability of the business that we place with those carriers 
the occurrence and severity of catastrophes could impair the amount of profit commissions that we receive in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
capacity in the reinsurance market is adversely impacted by catastrophes  which can adversely impact our results of operations 
we are subject to risks related to our profit commission arrangements and other compensation arrangements 
we derive a portion of our brokerage revenues from profit commissions based on the profitability of the insurance business we place with a carrier 
due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by some carriers  we cannot predict the receipt of these profit commissions and the amount of such profit commissions may be less than we anticipated 
because profit commissions affect our revenues  any decrease in such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  other companies have been the subject of investigations regarding profit commission arrangements by various governmental authorities within the past several years 
some of these investigations have focused on whether retail insurance brokers have adequately disclosed to their customers the receipt of profit commissions that are paid by insurance carriers to brokers based on the volume of business placed by the broker with the insurance carrier and other factors 
we have not been subject to any investigations that are focused on our disclosure of profit commissions 
the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing profit commission arrangements  including laws limiting or prohibiting such arrangements  and adding new or different disclosure of such arrangements to insureds 
various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters 
while we cannot predict the outcome of future governmental actions regarding commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators  any unfavorable resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to regulatory and legal matters we are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations  which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 
our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 
such regulation or compliance could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of compliance  limiting or restricting the products or services we sell  or the methods by which we sell our services and products  or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings 
in all jurisdictions  the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities 
generally  such authorities have broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals and to implement new regulations 
we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in any jurisdiction in which we operate 
we can give no assurances that our businesses can continue to be conducted in each jurisdiction as they have been in the past 
such regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders 
to that end  the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to matters  such as licensing and authorizing companies and agents to transact business  regulating capital and surplus and dividend requirements  regulating underwriting limitations  regulating the ability of companies to enter and exit markets  imposing statutory accounting requirements and annual statement disclosures  approving changes in control of insurance companies  regulating premium rates  including the ability to increase or maintain premium rates  regulating trade and claims practices  regulating certain transactions between affiliates  regulating reinsurance arrangements  including the balance sheet credit that may be taken by the ceding or direct insurer  mandating certain insurance benefits  regulating the content of disclosures to consumers  regulating the type  amounts and valuation of investments  mandating assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and the ability to recover such assessments in the future through premium increases  regulating market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents  including compensation arrangements  and regulating a variety of other financial and non financial components of an insurer s business 
our non insurance operations and certain aspects of our insurance operations are subject to various other federal and state regulations  including state and federal consumer protection  privacy and other laws 
an insurer s ability to write new business is partly a function of its statutory surplus 
maintaining appropriate levels of surplus as measured by statutory accounting principles is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers claims paying abilities and financial strength 
failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny  a downgrade by rating agencies or enforcement action by regulatory authorities 
we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and  despite our best efforts  our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant regulators interpretations of such laws and regulations 
also  some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals or to limit or restrain operations in their jurisdiction 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from operating  limit some or all of our activities or financially penalize us 
these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of our reputation and customers  reduction in our profitability and subject us to fines  penalties and litigation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we retain confidential information in our information systems  and we are subject to a variety of privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations 
for example  some of our activities are subject to the privacy regulations of the gramm leach bliley act 
we also have contractual obligations to protect confidential information we obtain from our clients 
these obligations generally require us  in accordance with applicable laws  to protect such information to the same extent that we protect our own confidential information 
we have implemented physical  administrative and logical security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and systems and protecting our  our clients and their customers confidential information and personally identifiable information against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection  theft or loss of data 
despite such efforts  we are subject to a breach of our security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and or the information we are trying to protect 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our information systems could access  view  misappropriate  alter  or delete any information in the systems  including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information 
in addition  most states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer information 
any compromise of the security of our information systems that results in inappropriate disclosure of such information could result in  among other things  unfavorable publicity and damage to our reputation  governmental inquiry and oversight  difficulty in marketing our services  loss of clients  significant civil and criminal liability and the incurrence of significant technical  legal and other expenses  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
changes in regulation may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and limit our growth 
legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future 
if we were unable for any reason to comply with these requirements  it could result in substantial costs to us and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include  but are not limited to prohibiting retailers from providing debt cancellation policies  prohibiting insurers from fronting captive reinsurance arrangements  placing or reducing interest rate caps on the consumer finance products our clients offer  limitations or imposed reductions on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies  increases in minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  impositions of increased fines  taxes or other penalties for improper licensing  the failure to promptly pay claims  however defined  or other regulatory violations  increased licensing requirements  restrictions on the ability to offer certain types of products  new or different disclosure requirements on certain types of products  and imposition of new or different requirements for coverage determinations 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
further  the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are re examining existing laws and regulations  specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations  interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations 
additionally  there have been attempts by the naic and several states to limit the use of discretionary clauses in policy forms 
the elimination of discretionary clauses could increase our costs under our payment protection products 
new interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new services and products and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously 
in addition  the naic s proposed expansion of the market conduct annual statement could increase the likelihood of examinations of insurance companies operating in niche markets 
court decisions that impact the insurance industry could result in the release of previously protected confidential and privileged information by departments of insurance  which could increase the risk of litigation 
traditionally  the us federal government has not directly regulated the business of insurance 
however  federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies 
these areas include financial services regulation  securities regulation  privacy  tort reform legislation and taxation 
in view of recent events involving certain financial institutions and the financial markets  congress passed and the president signed into law the dodd frank act  which provides for the enhanced federal supervision of financial institutions  including insurance companies in certain circumstances  and financial activities that represent a systemic risk to financial stability or the us economy 
under the dodd frank act  the federal insurance office will be established within the us treasury department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and its authority would likely extend to all lines of insurance that our insurance subsidiaries write 
the director of the federal insurance office will serve in an advisory capacity to the financial stability oversight council and have the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards by the federal reserve  if it is determined that financial distress at the company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the us economy 
the dodd frank act also provides for the preemption of state laws when inconsistent with certain international agreements and would streamline the regulation of reinsurance and surplus lines insurance 
at this time  we cannot assess whether any other proposed legislation or regulatory changes will be adopted  or what impact  if any  the dodd frank act or any other legislation or changes could have on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
further  in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn  regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations 
for example  insurance regulators may choose to restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies or reject rate increases due to the economic environment 
with respect to the property and casualty insurance policies our payment protection business underwrites  federal legislative proposals regarding national catastrophe insurance  if adopted  could reduce the business need for some of the related products we provide 
additionally  as the us congress continues to respond to the recent housing foreclosure crisis  it could enact legislation placing additional barriers on creditor placed insurance 
with regard to payment protection products  there are federal and state laws and regulations that govern the disclosures related to lenders sales of those products 
our ability to administer those products on behalf of financial institutions is dependent upon their continued ability to sell those products 
to the extent that federal or state laws or regulations change to restrict or prohibit the sale of these products  our administration services and fees revenues would be adversely affected 
the dodd frank act created a new bureau of consumer financial protection within the federal reserve  which will add new regulatory oversight for these lender products 
the full impact of this oversight cannot be determined until the bureau has been established and implementing regulations are put in place 
in recent years  several large organizations became subjects of intense public scrutiny due to high profile data security breaches involving sensitive financial and health information 
these events focused national attention on identity theft and the duty of organizations to notify impacted consumers in the event of a data security breach 
existing legislation in most states requires customer notification in the event of a data security breach 
in addition  some states are adopting laws and regulations requiring minimum information security practices with respect to the collection and storage of personally identifiable consumer data  and several bills before congress contain provisions directed to national information security standards and breach notification requirements 
several significant legal  operational and reputational risks exist with regard to a data breach and customer notification 
a breach of data security requiring public notification can result in regulatory fines  penalties or sanctions  civil lawsuits  loss of reputation  loss of clients and reduction of our profitability 
our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions 
we may be materially and adversely affected by judgments  settlements  unanticipated costs or other effects of legal and administrative proceedings now pending or that may be instituted in the future  or from investigations by regulatory bodies or administrative agencies 
from time to time  we have had inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business 
such inquiries may result in various audits  reviews and investigations 
an adverse outcome of any investigation by  or other inquiries from  such bodies or agencies could have a material adverse effect on us and result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings  sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties  changes in personnel  and increased review and scrutiny of us by our clients  regulatory authorities  potential litigants  the media and others 
in particular  our insurance related operations are subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by insurance departments in jurisdictions in which we do business 
these insurance departments have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business and  in particular  monitor the manner in which an insurance company offers  sells and administers its products 
therefore  we may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations  including  but not limited to disputes over coverage or claims adjudication  disputes over claim payment amounts and compliance with individual state regulatory requirements  disputes regarding sales practices  disclosures  premium refunds  licensing  regulatory compliance  underwriting and compensation arrangements  disputes with taxation and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities  periodic examinations of compliance with applicable federal and state laws  and industry wide investigations regarding business practices including  but not limited to  the use of finite reinsurance and the marketing and refunding of insurance policies or certificates of insurance 
the prevalence and outcomes of any such actions cannot be predicted  and such actions or any litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if we were to experience difficulties with our relationship with a regulatory body in a given jurisdiction  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business in that jurisdiction 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against insurance and related companies 
current and future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to these types of claims 
multi party or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic  non economic and or punitive damage awards 
the success of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award or a detrimental judicial ruling could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
this risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of liability or recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our businesses 
we cannot predict at this time the effect that current litigation  investigations and regulatory activity will have on the industries in which we operate or our business 
in light of the regulatory and judicial environments in which we operate  we will likely become subject to further investigations and lawsuits from time to time in the future 
our involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur legal and other costs and  if we were found to have violated any laws  we could be required to pay fines and damages  perhaps in material amounts 
in addition  we could be materially and adversely affected by the negative publicity for the insurance and other financial services industries related to any such proceedings and by any new industry wide regulations or practices that may result from any such proceedings 
risks related to our indebtedness our indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may materially and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 
our debt service obligations vary annually based on the amount of our indebtedness and the associated fixed and floating interest rates 
see management discussion analysis liquidity and capital resources liquidity regarding the amount of outstanding debt and our annual debt service 
our total indebtedness was million at december  compared to million at december  although we believe that our current cash flow will be sufficient to cover our annual interest expense  any increase in our indebtedness or any decline in the amount of cash available increases the possibility that we could not pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness 
in addition  our indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  including financial and other restrictive covenants  which could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness  make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy or other purposes 
any of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
increases in interest rates could increase interest payable under our variable rate indebtedness 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our variable rate indebtedness 
see part ii  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk regarding our interest rate risk and part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity regarding the amount of outstanding variable rate debt 
interest rate changes could increase the amount of our interest payments and thus negatively impact our future earnings and cash flows 
if we do not have sufficient earnings  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  borrow more money or sell more securities  none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 
we may enter into hedging transactions that may become ineffective which adversely impact our financial condition 
part of our interest rate risk strategy involves entering into hedging transactions to mitigate the risk of variable interest rate instruments by converting the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
each hedging item must be regularly evaluated for hedge effectiveness 
if it is determined that a hedging transaction is ineffective  we may be require to record losses reflected in our results of operations which could adversely impact our financial condition 
despite our indebtedness levels  we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur more indebtedness  which could further exacerbate the risks related to our indebtedness described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness 
if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt  the risks that we and they now face as a result of our indebtedness could intensify 
restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
the agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies or undertake actions that may be in our best interests 
the agreements governing our indebtedness include covenants restricting  among other things  our ability to incur or guarantee additional debt  incur liens  complete mergers  consolidations and dissolutions  sell certain of our assets that have been pledged as collateral  and undergo a change in control 
our assets have been pledged to secure some of our existing indebtedness 
our revolving credit facility with suntrust bank is secured by substantially all of our property and assets and property and assets owned by lots intermediate co 
and certain of our subsidiaries that act as guarantors of our existing indebtedness 
such assets include the stock of lots intermediate co 
and the right  title and interest of the borrowers and each guarantor in their respective material real estate property  fixtures  accounts  equipment  investment property  inventory  instruments  general intangibles  money  cash or cash equivalents  software and other assets and  in each case  the proceeds thereof  subject to certain exceptions 
in the event of a default under our indebtedness  the lender could foreclose against the assets securing such obligations 
a foreclosure on these assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to our technology and intellectual property our information systems may fail or their security may be compromised  which could damage our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information systems and our ability to store  retrieve  process and manage significant databases and expand and upgrade our information systems 
we rely on these systems throughout our businesses for a variety of functions  including marketing and selling our payment protection products  providing our bpo services  providing ereinsure s services to the reinsurance market  managing our operations  processing claims and applications  providing information to clients  performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records 
the interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through the loss of stored data  programming errors  the breakdown or malfunctioning of computer equipment or software systems  telecommunications failure or damage caused by weather or natural disasters or any other significant disruptions could harm our business  ability to generate revenues  client relationships  competitive position and reputation 
although we have additional data processing locations in jacksonville  florida and atlanta  georgia  disaster recovery procedures and insurance to protect against certain contingencies  such measures may not be effective or insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices  cover all such losses or be sufficient to compensate us for the loss of business that may result from any failure of our information systems 
in addition  our information systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions  computer viruses or other attacks which could disable our information systems and our security measures may not prevent such attacks 
the failure of our systems as a result of any security breaches  intrusions or attacks could cause significant interruptions to our operations  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the failure to effectively maintain and modernize our systems to keep up with technological advances could materially and adversely affect our business 
our businesses are dependent upon our ability to ensure that our information systems keep up with technological advances 
our ability to keep our systems integrated with those of our clients is critical to the success of our businesses 
if we do not effectively maintain our systems and update them to address technological advancements  our relationships and ability to do business with our clients may be materially and adversely affected 
our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems  and we have many different information systems for our various businesses 
we must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance existing information systems and develop new systems that allow us to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry  regulatory and legal standards and changing client preferences 
a failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems  or a failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems and eliminate redundant or obsolete applications  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or our ability to do business in particular jurisdictions 
if we do not effectively maintain adequate systems  we could experience adverse consequences  including the inability to effectively market and price our services and products and make underwriting and reserving decisions  the loss of existing clients  difficulty attracting new clients  regulatory problems  such as a failure to meet prompt payment obligations  internal control problems  exposure to litigation  security breaches resulting in loss of data  and increases in administrative expenses 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our ability not to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the success of our business will depend  in part  on preserving our trade secrets  maintaining the security of our know how and data and operating without infringing upon patents and proprietary rights held by third parties 
failure to protect  monitor and control the use of our intellectual property rights could cause us to lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures and copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our brands  technology and data 
these legal measures afford only limited protection  and competitors or others may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 
our trade secrets  data and know how could be subject to unauthorized use  misappropriation  or disclosure 
our trademarks could be challenged  forcing us to re brand our services or products  resulting in loss of brand recognition and requiring us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands or licensing 
if we are found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  we may be subject to injunctive relief restricting our use of affected elements of intellectual property used in the business  or we may be required to  among other things  pay royalties or enter into licensing agreements in order to obtain the rights to use necessary technologies  which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms  or redesign our systems  which may not be feasible 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
the intellectual property laws and other statutory and contractual arrangements we currently depend upon may not provide sufficient protection in the future to prevent the infringement  use or misappropriation of our trademarks  data  technology and other services and products 
policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive  and adequate remedies may not be available 
any future litigation  regardless of outcome  could result in substantial expense and diversion of resources with no assurance of success and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
risks related to our common stock there may not be an active  liquid trading market for our common stock 
prior to our initial public offering  there had been no public market for shares of our common stock 
we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in the company will continue to maintain a trading market on the new york stock exchange nyse or how liquid that market may continue to be 
if an active trading market in our common stock does not continue  you may have difficulty selling any of our common stock that you purchase 
as a public company  we are subject to additional financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy 
since the completion of our ipo  we are required to file with the sec annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the exchange act 
we are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all sec reporting requirements on a timely basis 
we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements  including the requirements of the nyse and certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of sox and the regulations promulgated thereunder  which impose significant compliance obligations upon us 
should we fail to comply with these rules and regulations we may face de listing from the nyse and face disciplinary actions from the sec which may adversely affect our stock price 
if our internal controls are found to be ineffective  our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 
our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december   we were in compliance with section of sox and our internal control over financial reporting was effective 
we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods  however  if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting  investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price 
our principal stockholder has substantial control over us 
affiliates of summit partners collectively and beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock at december  as a consequence  summit partners or its affiliates continue to be able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and any other significant transaction 
the interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders 
for instance  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price 
we expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly  which could cause a decline in the stock price  and holders of our common stock may not be able to resell shares at or above the cost of such shares 
securities markets worldwide have experienced  and are likely to continue to experience  significant price and volume fluctuations 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors  including market conditions in the broader stock market  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  investor perceptions of us and the industries in which we operate  sales  or anticipated sales  of large blocks of our stock  additions or departures of key personnel  regulatory or political developments  litigation and governmental investigations  and changing economic conditions 
these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially  which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock 
in addition  in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business  which could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation 
if a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time  the market price of our common stock could decline 
at december  we had  shares of common stock outstanding  including shares held in treasury  with our directors  executive officers and affiliates holding a significant majority of these shares 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
the perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock 
a decline in the market price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business  publish research or reports containing negative information about our business  adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
moreover  if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock  or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations  our stock price could decline 
some provisions of delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for  among other things restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and the business that can be conducted at such meeting  restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove a director or fill a vacancy on the board of directors  our ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the board of directors may determine  without stockholder approval  the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors  a prohibition of action by written consent of stockholders unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations 
these provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company that is in the best interest of our non controlling stockholders 
even in the absence of a takeover attempt  the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change in control of us 
state insurance regulatory laws contain provisions that require advance approval  by the state insurance commissioner  of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled  or  in some cases  having such substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled  in that state 
we own  directly or indirectly  all of the shares of stock of insurance companies domiciled in delaware  georgia and louisiana  and of the shares of stock of an insurance company domiciled in kentucky 
because any purchaser of shares of our common stock representing or more of the voting power of the capital stock of fortegra generally will be presumed to have acquired control of these insurance company subsidiaries  the insurance change in control laws of delaware  georgia  louisiana and kentucky would apply to such a transaction 
in addition  the laws of many states contain provisions requiring pre notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a non domestic insurance company subsidiary that transacts business in that state 
while these pre notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change in control  they do authorize issuance of cease and desist orders with respect to the non domestic insurer if it is determined that conditions  such as undue market concentration  would result from the change in control 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  for the foreseeable future  to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
we do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future to holders of our common stock 
as a result  capital appreciation in the price of our common stock  if any  will be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock

item legal proceedings we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of our operations 
we believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in our payment protection business  we are currently a defendant in lawsuits that relate to marketing and or pricing issues that involve claims for punitive  exemplary or extra contractual damages in amounts substantially in excess of the covered claim 
such litigation includes lawson v 
life of the south insurance co  which was filed on march   in the superior court of muscogee county  georgia  and later moved to the united states district court for the middle district of georgia  columbus division 
the action is brought by the plaintiff  individually and on behalf of a class of all persons similarly situated 
the allegations involve our alleged duty to refund unearned premiums on credit insurance policies  even when we have not been informed of the payoff of the underlying finance contract 
the action seeks an injunction requiring remedial action  as well as a variety of damages  including punitive damages  and attorney fees and costs 
to date  a class has not been certified in this action 
a discovery stay was lifted on november  also in our payment protection business  we are currently a defendant in mullins v 
southern financial life insurance co  which was filed on february   in the pike circuit court  in the commonwealth of kentucky 
in this class action litigation  the class was certified on june  at issue in the case is the duration or term of coverage under certain credit insurance policies 
the action alleges violations of the consumer protection act and certain insurance statutes  as well as common law fraud 
the action seeks compensatory and punitive damages  attorney fees and interest 
the parties are currently involved in the discovery phase 
no trial date has been set 
we consider such litigation  which we are vigorously defending  customary in our line of business 
we do not expect the ultimate resolution of such litigation to be materially adverse to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
it should be noted that large punitive damage awards  bearing little relation to actual damages sustained by plaintiffs  have been awarded in certain states against other companies in the credit insurance business

risk factors of this annual report 
executive summary for the year ended december   our overall revenues increased million  or  to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to brokerage commissions  service and administrative fees  net realized gains and net earned premiums 
our net income for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period in and was primarily impacted by higher operating costs 
earnings per diluted share were for the year ended december  compared to for total expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the majority of the increase was associated with our own internal expansion and acquired businesses and included increases of million in personnel costs  million in other operating expenses  million in commission expense and a million increase in total depreciation and amortization of intangibles 
during  we continued to expand our insurance services product offering and geographic reach with the acquisition of auto knight in january  ereinsure in march  and pacific benefits group in october and magna in december each acquisition added scale and key capabilities to our payment protection  bpo and brokerage segments 
our auto knight acquisition extended our roadside assistance product marketing capabilities to affinity marketing and added new products and services such as key replacement and tire and wheel protection 
ereinsure brought to us a unique platform for transacting facultative reinsurance transactions 
the ereinsure platform is a singularly unique provider to the leading insurance and reinsurance companies worldwide 
with the acquisition of pacific benefits group  we significantly expanded our distribution capabilities 
we now are able to provide our clients a menu of services that includes direct response marketing and sales  administration  and servicing 
this unique capability will be the focal point of our future strategy to capitalize on mass marketing of our complementary products to our client s customers allowing our clients to monetize what was once lost sales opportunities 
finally  the assumption reinsurance treaty with magna provided a key payment protection client a viable exit strategy for a non core activity  and afforded our bpo segment some of the servicing capabilities relative to term life and annuity products that we can incorporate into new product and servicing opportunities in the future 
during  many of our brands were recognized for their significant achievements 
life of the south is now recognized as the second leading credit life provider as measured by am best and bliss glennon is a top ten broker for excess and surplus lines 
in  we expanded our revolving credit facility to a maximum of million from million to help facilitate the expansion of our growth and acquisitions 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced a program to buy back up to million of our shares of common stock 
at december   the company had acquired a total of  shares at an aggregate value of million 
we view the stock buyback programs as an effective method of creating stockholder value and prudent use of available cash resources 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
see use of estimates and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report for additional information 
we periodically evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual performance should differ from historical experience or if the underlying assumptions were to change  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted 
in addition  some accounting policies require significant judgment to apply complex principles of accounting to certain transactions  such as acquisitions  in determining the most appropriate accounting treatment 
we believe that the significant accounting estimates and policies described below are material to our financial reporting and are subject to a degree of subjectivity and or complexity 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
investments we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion  properly valued  and if necessary  written down to their fair value through a charge against earnings in the proper period 
the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in fair value requires the judgment of management 
the analysis takes into account relevant factors  both quantitative and qualitative in nature 
among the factors considered are the following the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost  issuer specific considerations  including an issuer s short term prospects and financial condition  recent news that may have an adverse impact on its results  and an event of missed or late payment or default  the occurrence of a significant economic event that may affect the industry in which an issuer participates  and for loan backed and structured securities  the undiscounted estimated future cash flows as compared to the current book value 
when such impairments occur  the decrease in fair value is reported in net income as a realized investment loss and a new cost basis is established 
with respect to securities where the decline in fair value is determined to be temporary and the security s fair value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
if we do not expect for a security s decline in fair value to be fully recovered prior to the expected time of sale  we would record an other than temporary impairment in the period in which the decision to sell is made 
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy  a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies  industry sectors or countries could result in additional impairments in future periods for other than temporary declines in fair value 
see the footnote  investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information and item a 
risk factors risks related to our payment protection business our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the fair value of our invested assets and cash and may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability and liquidity and capital resources liquidity contained elsewhere in this annual report 
reinsurance reinsurance receivables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims  future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits 
the cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets 
in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non affiliated companies  including reinsurance companies owned by our clients 
the following table provides details of the reinsurance receivables balance at in thousands at december  ceded unearned premiums life accident and health property total ceded unearned premiums ceded claim reserves life accident and health property total ceded claim reserves recoverable other reinsurance settlements recoverable reinsurance receivables we utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our payment protection business reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses  and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers 
property and equipment property and equipment are carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
gains and losses on sales and disposals of property and equipment are based on the net book value of the related asset at the disposal date using the specific identification method with the corresponding gain or loss recorded to operations when incurred 
maintenance and repairs  which do not materially extend asset useful life and minor replacements  are charged to earnings when incurred 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets with three years for computers and five years for furniture  fixtures  equipment and software 
leasehold improvements and capitalized leases are depreciated over the remaining life of the lease 
we capitalize internally developed software costs on a project by project basis in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other internal use software 
all costs to establish the technological feasibility of computer software development are expensed to operations when incurred 
internally developed software development costs are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are amortized based on the current and estimated useful life of the software 
amortization over the estimated useful life of five years begins when the software is ready for its intended use 
deferred acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new business and retaining existing business  principally commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting and marketing costs that vary with and are primarily related to the processing of new business  have been deferred and are amortized as the related premium is earned 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs are recorded in commissions expense or other operating expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to commissions is classified as commission expense 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to premium taxes and certain underwriting and marketing costs is classified as other operating expenses 
amortization of deferred acquisition costs for the years ended december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we evaluate whether deferred acquisition costs are recoverable at year end  and consider investment income in the recoverability analysis 
as a result of our evaluations  no write offs for unrecoverable deferred acquisition costs were recognized during the years ended december   and goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination 
other intangible assets include trademarks  customer related and contract based assets representing primarily client lists and non compete arrangements and acquired software 
goodwill and other intangible assets are carried as assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill represented million  million  and million of our total assets as of december   and  respectively while other intangible assets represented million  million  and million of our total assets as of december   and  respectively 
our goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
our reporting units for impairment testing purposes are identical to our operating segments 
in we adopted accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu allows for the goodwill impairment analysis to start with an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the qualitative factors  management determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we perform the two part quantitative impairment test under topic if the carrying amount of the goodwill of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess 
the goodwill impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded 
discounted cash flow methods are dependent upon assumption of future sales trends  market conditions and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted 
other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows 
management assessed goodwill as of december   and and determined that no impairment existed as of those dates 
unpaid claims unpaid claims are reserve estimates that are established in accordance with us gaap using generally accepted actuarial methods 
credit life  credit disability and accidental death and dismemberment ad d unpaid claims reserves include claims in the course of settlement and incurred but not reported ibnr 
for all other product lines  unpaid claims reserves are entirely ibnr 
we use a number of algorithms in establishing our unpaid claims reserves 
these algorithms are used to calculate unpaid claims as a function of paid losses  earned premium  target loss ratios  in force amounts  unearned premium reserves  industry recognized morbidity tables or a combination of these factors 
the factors used to develop the ibnr vary by product line 
however  in general terms  the factor used to develop ibnr for credit life insurance is a function of the amount of life insurance in force 
the factor can vary from to per  of in force coverage 
the factor used to develop ibnr for credit disability is a function of the pro rata unearned premium reserve and is typically of unearned premium reserve 
finally  ibnr for ad d policies is a function of in force coverage and is currently per  of in force coverage 
in accordance with applicable statutory insurance company regulations  our unpaid claims reserves are evaluated by appointed actuaries 
the appointed actuaries perform this function in compliance with the standards of practice and codes of conduct of the american academy of actuaries 
the appointed actuaries perform their actuarial analysis each year and prepare opinions  statements and reports documenting their determinations 
the appointed actuaries conduct their actuarial analysis on a basis gross of reinsurance 
the same estimates used as a basis in calculating the gross unpaid claims reserves are then used as the basis for calculating the net unpaid claims reserves  which take into account the impact of reinsurance 
anticipated future loss development patterns form a key assumption underlying these analyses 
our claims are generally reported and settled quickly resulting in a consistent historical loss development pattern 
from the anticipated loss development patterns  a variety of actuarial loss projection techniques are employed  such as chain ladder method  the bornhuetter ferguson method and expected loss ratio method 
our unpaid claims reserves do not represent an exact calculation of exposure  but instead represent our best estimates  generally involving actuarial projections at a given time 
the process used in determining our unpaid claims reserves cannot be exact since actual claim costs are dependent upon a number of complex factors such as changes in doctrines of legal liabilities and damage awards 
these factors are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
we periodically review and update our methods of making such unpaid claims reserve estimates and establishing the related liabilities based on our actual experience 
we have not made any changes to our methodologies for determining unpaid claims reserves in the periods presented 
the following table provides unpaid claims reserve information by payment protection product line in thousands as of december  as of december  as of december  product type in course of settlement ibnr total claim reserve in course of settlement ibnr total claim reserve in course of settlement ibnr total claim reserve property surety general liability credit life credit disability ad d other total in course of settlement represents amounts reserved to pay claims known but are not yet paid 
ibnr reserves represent amounts reserved to pay claims where the insured event has occurred and has not yet been reported 
ibnr reserves for credit disability also include the net present value of future claims payment of   and  as of december   and  respectively 
general liability primarily represents amounts reserved to pay claims on contractual liability policies behind debt cancellation products 
most of our credit insurance business is written on a retrospective commission basis  which permits management to adjust commissions based on claims experience 
thus  any adjustment to prior years incurred claims in this line of business is partially offset by a change in retrospective commissions 
while management has used its best judgment in establishing the estimate of required unpaid claims  different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different unpaid claims estimates 
two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency  which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure  and loss severity  which is based on the average size of claims 
factors affecting loss frequency and loss severity include changes in claims reporting patterns  claims settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  economic conditions  morbidity patterns and the attitudes of claimants towards settlements 
the adequacy of our unpaid claims reserves will be impacted by future trends that impact these factors 
while our cost of claims has not varied significantly from our reserves in prior periods  if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected  our paid claims will be different than management s estimate 
we believe that  based on our actuarial analysis  an aggregate change that is greater than or for each of loss frequency and severity is not probable 
the effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity levels on our ultimate cost for claims occurring in would be as follows dollars in thousands sensitivity change in both loss frequency and severity for all payment protection products claims cost change in claims cost higher higher higher base scenario lower lower lower adjustments to our unpaid claims reserves  both positive and negative  are reflected in our statement of income for the period in which such estimates are updated 
because the establishment of our unpaid claims reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses  there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves 
future loss development could require our reserves to be increased  which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made 
unearned premiums premiums written are earned over the period that coverage is provided 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums that will be earned in the future and are generally calculated using the pro rata method 
a premium deficiency reserve is recorded if anticipated losses  loss adjustment expenses  deferred policy acquisition costs and policy maintenance costs exceed the recorded unearned premium reserve and anticipated investment income 
as of december   and  no such reserve was recorded 
income taxes the calculation of tax liabilities is complex  and requires the use of estimates and judgments by management since it involves application of complex tax laws 
we record our income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes  referred to as temporary differences  and are based on the enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse 
under asc topic  income taxes  a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining whether our deferred tax asset is realizable  we considered all available evidence  including both positive and negative evidence 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carry back or carry forward period 
we considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset  including the future reversal of existing temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards  taxable income in carry back years and tax planning strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has not been established 
the detailed components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the footnote  income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
contingencies we follow the requirements of the contingencies guidance  which is included within asc topic  contingencies 
this requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately 
a loss is reported if reasonably estimable and probable 
we establish reserves for these contingencies at the best estimate  or  if no one estimated number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other  we report an estimated reserve at the midpoint of the estimated range 
contingencies affecting us include litigation matters which are inherently difficult to evaluate and are subject to significant changes 
service and administrative fees we earn service and administrative fees for a variety of activities 
this includes providing administrative services for other insurance companies  debt cancellation programs  motor club memberships  collateral tracking  and asset recovery services 
payment protection administrative service revenue is recognized consistent with the earnings recognition pattern of the underlying insurance policy or debt cancellation contract being administered 
for example  if the credit instrument is months in duration  the credit insurance policy or debt cancellation contract is also months 
because we provide administrative services over the life of the policy or debt cancellation contract  we recognize service and administrative fees over the life of the insurance policy or debt cancellation contract 
accordingly  if there is a pre term cancellation  no funds would be due to our customer 
as a result  we have had no significant changes in earnings patterns  resulting in no prior period adjustments to total revenues or net income 
bpo service fee revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
these services include fulfillment  bpo software development and claims handling for our customers 
collateral tracking fee income is recognized when the service is performed and billed 
asset recovery service revenue is recognized upon the location of a recovered unit 
management reviews the financial results under each significant bpo contract on a monthly basis 
any losses that may occur due to a specific contract would be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs 
for the periods presented  we have not incurred a loss with respect to a specific significant bpo contract 
brokerage commissions and fees we earn brokerage commission and fee income by providing wholesale brokerage services to retail insurance brokers and agents and insurance companies 
brokerage commission income is primarily recognized when the underlying insurance policies are issued 
a portion of the brokerage commission income is derived from profit agreements with insurance carriers 
these commissions are received from carriers based upon the underlying underwriting profitability of the business that we place with those carriers 
profit commission income is generally recognized as revenue on the receipt of cash based on the terms of the respective carrier contracts 
in certain instances  profit commission income may be recognized in advance of cash receipt where the profit commission income due to be received has been calculated or has been confirmed by the insurance carrier 
see revenues brokerage commissions and fees in this md a for a discussion of various factors that impact our brokerage commissions and fees 
ceding commissions ceding commissions earned under coinsurance agreements are based on contractual formulas that take into account  in part  underwriting performance and investment returns experienced by the assuming companies 
as experience changes  adjustments to the ceding commissions are reflected in the period incurred 
experience adjustments are based on the claim experience of the related policy 
the adjustment is calculated by adding the earned premium and investment income from the assets held in trust for our benefit less earned commissions  incurred claims and the reinsurer s fee for the coverage 
see revenues ceding commissions for additional information on our ceding commissions 
our experience adjustments  exclusive of investment income are as follows in thousands years ended december  experience adjustments net earned premium net earned premium is from direct and assumed earned premium consisting of revenue generated from the direct sale of payment protection insurance policies by our distributors or premiums written for payment protection insurance policies by another carrier and assumed by us 
whether direct or assumed  the premium is earned over the life of the respective policy 
direct and assumed earned premium are offset by premiums ceded to our reinsurers  including producer owned reinsurance companies porcs 
the amount ceded is proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the reinsurer 
commissions the commission costs include the commissions paid to the distributors for selling the policy 
the commission costs also include retrospective commission adjustments 
these retrospective commission adjustments are payments made or adjustments to future commission expense based on claims experience 
under these retrospective commission arrangements  the commissions paid are adjusted based on actual losses incurred compared to premium earned after a specified net allowance is retained by us 
net investment income we earn net investment income from interest payments and dividends received from our investment portfolio  and interest earned on our cash accounts and notes receivable  less portfolio management expenses 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities which tend to produce consistent levels of investment income 
the fair value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
the fair value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates 
investment income can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or unrealized losses in our portfolios 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on  and the fair value of  fixed maturity and short term investments 
we also have investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk may differ from estimates at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
in periods of declining interest rates  mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates 
therefore  we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments 
conversely  in times of rising interest rates  prepayments slow as borrowers tend to be less likely to refinance borrowings at higher interest rates  which tends to increase the duration of our investment holdings 
with the increase in investment duration  we will have less cash flows from prepayments to invest at higher prevailing market rates 
stock based compensation we currently have stock options outstanding under our equity incentive plan and stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding under the omnibus incentive plan 
we record stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  which addresses the accounting for share based awards 
we measure stock based compensation expense using the calculated value method 
under this method  we estimate the fair value of each stock option on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model 
we use historical data to estimate expected employee behavior related to stock award exercises and forfeitures 
since there is not sufficient historical market experience for shares of the company s stock  we have chosen to estimate volatility  by using the average volatility of a selected peer group of publicly traded companies operating in the same industry 
expected dividends are based on the assumption that no dividends are expected to be distributed in the near future 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
we typically recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
please see the footnote  stock based compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
recently issued accounting standards for a discussion on recently issued accounting standards please see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
components of revenues and expenses revenues service and administrative fees 
we earn service and administrative fees from our payment protection and bpo business segments 
such fees are typically positively correlated with transaction volume and are recognized as revenue as they become both realized and earned 
we earn service and administrative fees from a variety of activities  including the administration of credit insurance  the administration of debt cancellation programs  the administration of motor club programs  the administration of warranty programs and the administration of collateral tracking and asset recovery programs 
payment protection 
our payment protection products are sold as complementary products to consumer retail and credit transactions and are thus subject to the volatility of volume of consumer purchase and credit activities 
we receive service and administrative fees for administering payment protection products that are sold by our clients  such as credit insurance  debt protection  motor club and warranty solutions 
we earn administrative fees for administering debt cancellation plans  facilitating the distribution and administration of warranty or extended service contracts  providing motor club membership benefits and providing related services for our clients 
for credit insurance products  our clients typically retain the risk associated with credit insurance products that they sell to their customers through economic arrangements with us 
our payment protection revenue includes revenue earned from reinsurance arrangements with producer owned reinsurance companies owned by our clients 
our clients own producer owned reinsurance companies porcs that assume the credit insurance premiums and associated risk that they originate in exchange for fees paid to us for ceding the premiums 
in addition  our payment protection revenue includes administrative fees charged by us under retrospective commission arrangements with producers  where the commissions paid are adjusted based on actual losses incurred compared to premium earned after a specified net allowance retained by us 
under these arrangements  our insurance companies receive the insurance premiums and administer the policies that are distributed by our clients 
the producer of the credit insurance policies receives a retrospective commission if the premium generated by that producer in the accounting period exceeds the costs associated with those polices  which includes our administrative fees  incurred claims  reserves and premium taxes 
if the net result is negative  we either offset that negative amount against future retrospective commission payments  reduce the producer s up front commission on a prospective basis to increase the likelihood that it will return to a positive position or request payment of the negative amount from the producer 
revenues in our payment protection business may fluctuate seasonally based on consumer spending trends  where consumer spending has historically been higher in september and december  corresponding to back to school and the holiday season 
accordingly  our payment protection revenues may reflect higher third and fourth quarters than in the first half of the year 
bpo 
our bpo revenues consist primarily of service and administrative fees for providing a broad set of administrative services tailored to insurance and other financial services companies including ongoing sales and marketing support  premium billing and collections  policy administration  claims adjudication  call center management services and the development of web hosted applications for the reinsurance market 
in addition  our bpo segment markets and sells health  accident  critical illness and life insurance policies to customers in the us our bpo revenues are based on the volume of business that we manage on behalf of our clients 
our bpo segment typically charges fees on a per unit of service basis as a percentage of our client s insurance premiums 
brokerage commissions and fees 
brokerage commissions and fees consist of commissions paid to us by insurance companies  net of the portion of the commissions we share with retail insurance brokers and agents 
the commissions we receive from insurance carriers are typically calculated as a percentage of the premiums paid for the specialized and complex insurance products commonly known as surplus lines we distribute 
we typically earn our commissions on the later of the effective date of the policy or the date coverage is bound 
we pay our retail insurance agent and broker clients a portion of the gross commissions we receive from insurance carriers for placing insurance 
in certain cases  our brokerage segment also charges fees for policy issuance  inspections and other types of transactions 
our brokerage segment also derives fees from master license agreements to use the ereinsure system together with fees for the transactions completed through its platform 
brokerage commissions and fees are generally affected by fluctuations in the amount of premium charged by insurance carriers 
the premiums charged fluctuate based on  among other factors  the amount of capital available in the insurance marketplace  the type of risk being insured  the nature of the insured party and the terms of the insurance purchased 
if premiums increase or decrease  our revenues are typically affected in a corresponding fashion 
in a declining premium rate environment  the resulting decline in our revenue may be offset  in whole or in part  by an increase in commission rates from insurance carriers and by an increased likelihood that insured parties may use the savings generated by the reduction in premium rates to purchase greater coverage 
in an increasing pricing environment  the resulting increase in our revenue may be offset  in whole or in part  by a decrease in commission rates by insurance carriers and by an increased likelihood that insured parties may determine to reduce the amount of coverage they purchase 
the market for p c insurance products is cyclical from a capacity and pricing perspective 
we refer to a period of reduced capacity and rising premium rates as a hard market and a period of increased capacity and declining premium rates as a soft market 
gross commission rates for the products that we distribute in our brokerage segment  whether acting as a wholesale broker or as a managing general agent mga  generally range from to of the annual premium for the policy 
brokerage commissions and fees net of commissions paid to our retail insurance agent and broker clients typically approximate 
demand for surplus lines insurance products also affects our premium volume and net commissions 
state regulations generally require a buyer of insurance to have been turned down by three or more traditional carriers before being eligible to purchase the surplus lines distributed by us 
as standard insurance carriers eliminate non core lines of business and implement more conservative risk selection techniques  demand for excess and surplus lines insurance improves 
our brokerage commission and fee revenues fluctuate seasonally based on policy renewal dates 
our brokerage commissions and fees in the first two calendar quarters of any year historically have been higher than in the last two calendar quarters 
in addition  our quarterly brokerage revenues may be affected by new placements and cancellations or non renewals of large insurance policies as the revenue stream related to this policy is recognized once per year  as opposed to ratably throughout the year 
seasonal fluctuations may be impacted by the addition of ereinsure  where transaction fees are generally higher in the second and fourth quarters 
we also receive profit commissions for certain arrangements with certain insurance carriers on binding authority business 
these profit commissions are based on the profitability of the business that we underwrite or broker on the insurance carrier s behalf 
profit commissions typically range from to of the annual premium and are paid periodically based on the terms of the individual carrier contract 
ceding commissions 
ceding commission earned under coinsurance agreements are based on contractual formulas that take into account  in part  underwriting performance and investment returns experienced by assuming companies 
as experience changes  adjustments to the ceding commissions are reflected in the period incurred 
we elect to cede to reinsurers under coinsurance arrangements a significant portion of the credit insurance that we distribute on behalf of our clients 
we continue to provide all policy administration for credit insurance that we cede to reinsurers 
ceding commissions consist of commissions paid to us by our reinsurers to reimburse us for costs related to the acquisition  administration and servicing of policies and premium that we cede to reinsurers 
in addition  a portion of the ceding commission is determined based on the underwriting profits of the ceded credit insurance 
the credit insurance that we distribute has historically generated attractive underwriting profits 
furthermore  some reinsurers pay to us a portion or all of the investment income earned on reserves that are maintained in trust accounts 
ceding commissions are generally positively correlated with our credit insurance transaction and premium volumes 
the portion of our ceding commissions that is related to the underwriting profits of the ceded credit insurance also fluctuates based on the claims made on such policies 
the portion of our ceding commissions that is related to investment income can be impacted by the amount of reserves that are maintained in trust accounts and changes in interest rates 
ceding commissions are earned over the life of the policy 
ceding commissions are generated by the payment protection segment only for credit insurance 
net earned premium 
net earned premium consists of revenue generated from the direct sale of payment protection insurance policies by our distributors or premiums written for payment protection insurance policies by another carrier and assumed by us 
whether direct or assumed  the premium is earned over the term of the respective policy 
premiums earned are offset by earned premiums ceded to our reinsurers  including porcs 
the amount ceded is proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the reinsurer 
the principal factors affecting earned premiums are i the proportion of the risk assumed by the reinsurer as defined in the reinsurance treaty  ii increases and decreases in written premium  iii increases and decreases in policy cancellation rates  iv the average duration of the policies written  and v changes in regulation that would modify the earning patterns for the policies underwritten and administered 
we limit the underwriting risk we take in our payment protection insurance policies 
when we do assume risk in our payment protection insurance policies  we utilize both reinsurance eg  quota share and excess of loss and retrospective commission agreements to manage and mitigate our risk 
net realized gains losses 
we realize gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than the amortized cost in the case of fixed maturity securities and cost basis for equity securities 
we recognize realized losses for invested assets sold for an amount less than their carrying cost or when fixed maturity securities or equity securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment otti 
net investment income 
we earn net investment income from interest payments and dividends received from our investment portfolio  and interest earned on our cash accounts and notes receivable  less portfolio management expenses 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities which tend to produce consistent levels of investment income 
the fair value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
the fair value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates 
investment income can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or unrealized losses in our portfolios 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on  and the fair value of  fixed maturity and short term investments 
we also have investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk may differ from estimates at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
in periods of declining interest rates  mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates 
therefore  we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments 
conversely  in times of rising interest rates  prepayments slow as borrowers tend to be less likely to refinance borrowings at higher interest rates  which tends to increase the duration of our investment holdings 
with the increase in investment duration  we will have less cash flows from prepayments to invest at higher prevailing market rates 
other income 
other income primarily consists of miscellaneous fees generated by our brokerage and payment protection segments 
expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses include actual paid claims and the change in unpaid claim reserves and consist of direct and assumed losses less ceded losses 
our profitability depends in part on accurately predicting net loss and loss adjustment expenses 
incurred claims are impacted by loss frequency  which is the measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure  and loss severity  which is based on the average size of claims 
factors affecting loss frequency and loss severity include changes in claims reporting patterns  claims settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  economic conditions  morbidity patterns and the attitudes of claimants towards settlements 
actual claims paid are claims payments made to the policyholder or beneficiary during the accounting period 
the change in unpaid claim reserve is an increase or reduction to the unpaid claim reserve in the accounting period to maintain the unpaid claim reserve at the levels evaluated by our actuaries 
unpaid claims are reserve estimates that are established in accordance with us gaap using generally accepted actuarial methods 
credit life and ad d unpaid claims reserves include claims in the course of settlement and incurred but not reported ibnr 
credit disability unpaid claims reserves also include continuing claim reserves for open disability claims 
for all other product lines  unpaid claims reserves are bulk reserves and are entirely ibnr 
we use a number of algorithms in establishing our unpaid claims reserves 
these algorithms are used to calculate unpaid claims as a function of paid losses  earned premium  target loss ratios  in force amounts  unearned premium reserves  industry recognized morbidity tables or a combination of these factors 
in accordance with applicable statutory insurance company regulations  our unpaid claims reserves are evaluated by appointed actuaries 
the appointed actuaries perform this function in compliance with the standards of practice and codes of conduct of the american academy of actuaries 
the appointed actuaries perform their actuarial analyses each year and prepare opinions  statements and reports documenting their determinations 
the appointed actuaries conduct their actuarial analysis on a basis gross of reinsurance 
the same estimates used as a basis in calculating the gross unpaid claims reserves are then used as the basis for calculating the net unpaid claims reserves  which take into account the impact of reinsurance 
anticipated future loss development patterns form a key assumption underlying these analyses 
our claims are generally reported and settled quickly  resulting in a consistent historical loss development pattern 
from the anticipated loss development patterns  a variety of actuarial loss projection techniques are employed  such as the chain ladder method  the bornhuetter ferguson method and expected loss ratio method 
our unpaid claims reserves do not represent an exact calculation of exposure  but instead represent our best estimates  generally involving actuarial projections at a given time 
the process used in determining our unpaid claims reserves cannot be exact since actual claim costs are dependent upon a number of complex factors such as changes in doctrines of legal liabilities and damage awards 
these factors are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
we periodically review and update our methods of making such unpaid claims reserve estimates and establishing the related liabilities based on our actual experience 
we have not made any changes to our methodologies for determining unpaid claims reserves in the periods presented 
commissions 
commissions include the commissions paid to distributors selling credit insurance policies offered by our payment protection division 
commission rates  in many instances  are set by state regulators and are also impacted by market conditions 
in certain instances  our commissions are subject to retrospective adjustment based on the profitability of the related policies 
these retrospective commission adjustments are payments made or adjustments to future commission expense based on claims experience 
under these retrospective commission arrangements  the producer of the credit insurance policies  which is typically our client  receives a retrospective commission if the premium generated by that producer in the accounting period exceeds the costs associated with those policies  which includes our administrative fees  claims  reserves and premium taxes 
if the net result is negative  we either offset that negative amount against future retrospective commission payments  reduce the producer s up front commission on a prospective basis to increase the likelihood that it will return to a positive position or request payment of the negative amount from the producer 
personnel costs 
personnel costs represent the amounts attributable to wages  salaries  bonuses and benefits for our full and part time employees  as well as expense related to our stock based compensation 
in addition to our general personnel costs  some of the employees in our brokerage and payment protections segments are paid a percentage of revenues they generate 
accordingly  compensation for brokers in our brokerage segment is predominantly variable 
bonuses for the remaining employees are discretionary and are based on an evaluation of their individual performance and the performance of their particular business segment  as well as our entire company 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses consist primarily of rent  insurance  investigation fees  transaction expenses  professional fees  technology costs  travel and entertainment and advertising  and may include variable costs based on the volume of business we process 
other operating expenses are a significant portion of our expenses 
depreciation 
depreciation expense is the allocation of the capitalized cost of property and equipment over the periods benefited by the use of the asset 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles is an expense recorded to allocate the cost of intangible assets  such as purchased customer accounts and non compete agreements acquired as part of our business acquisitions  over their estimated useful lives 
interest expense 
interest expense includes interest payable on our credit facilities  mainly our notes payable  preferred trust securities and redeemable preferred stock  and is directly correlated to the levels of and the prevailing interest rates on these debt instruments 
income taxes 
income taxes are comprised of federal and state taxes based on income in multiple jurisdictions and changes in uncertain tax positions  if any

results of operations segments we conduct our business through three business segments i payment protection  ii bpo  and iii brokerage 
the revenue for each segment is presented to reflect the operating characteristics of the segment 
we do allocate certain revenues and costs to our segments 
these items primarily consist of corporate related income  transaction related costs  executive stock compensation and other overhead expenses 
we measure the profitability of our business segments with the allocation of corporate income and expenses and without taking into account amortization  depreciation  interest expense and income taxes 
we refer to these performance measures as segment ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and segment ebitda margin segment ebitda divided by segment net revenues 
our measures of segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin  meet the definition of non gaap financial measures 
these measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  the us gaap information provided in this annual report 
we believe that these non gaap presentations provide useful information to management  analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition 
our industry peers provide similar supplemental non gaap information  although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments 
the non gaap information we provide should be used in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the us gaap information provided elsewhere in this annual report 
the variability of our segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin is significantly affected by our segment net revenues because a large portion of our operating expenses are fixed 
for additional information regarding segment net revenues and operating expenses  see the footnote  segment results in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

the distribution channel results for the years ended december  and december  have been reclassified from their prior period segment presentation 
the impact of these reclassifications were million in revenues and million in expenses being moved from the bpo segment into the brokerage segment for the year ended december  and million in revenues and million in expenses being moved from the bpo segment into the brokerage segment for the year ended december  in order to conform to the presentation for the year ended december  we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda in this annual report to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our operating performance and  in the case of adjusted ebitda  information utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and in the determination of compensation 
ebitda  as used in this annual report is defined as net income before interest expense  income taxes  non controlling interest and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda differs from the term ebitda as it is commonly used 
adjusted ebitda  as used in this annual report  means consolidated adjusted ebitda as that term is defined under our revolving credit facility  which is generally consolidated net income before consolidated interest expense  consolidated amortization expense  consolidated depreciation expense and consolidated tax expense  in each case as defined more fully in the agreement governing our revolving credit facility 
the other items excluded in this calculation include  but are not limited to  specified acquisition costs and unusual or non recurring charges 
the calculation below does not give effect to certain additional adjustments that are permitted under our revolving credit facility which  if included  would increase the amount of adjusted ebitda reflected in this table 
in addition to the financial covenant requirements under our revolving credit facility  management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda as measures of operating performance for planning purposes  including the preparation of budgets and projections  the determination of bonus compensation for our executive officers and the analysis of the allocation of resources and to evaluate the effectiveness of business strategies 
further  we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in industries similar to ours 
adjusted ebitda is also used by management to measure operating performance and by investors to measure a company s ability to service its debt and other cash needs 
management believes the inclusion of the adjustments to ebitda and adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
accordingly  they should not be used as an indicator of  or alternative to  net income as a measure of operating performance 
although we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda as measures to assess the operating performance of our business  ebitda and adjusted ebitda have significant limitations as analytical tools because they exclude certain material costs 
for example  they do not include interest expense  which has been a necessary element of our costs 
since we use capital assets  depreciation expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate service revenues 
in addition  the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of this measure 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda also do not include the payment of taxes  which is also a necessary element of our operations 
because ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not account for these expenses  its utility as a measure of our operating performance has material limitations 
due to these limitations  management does not view ebitda and adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a primary performance measure and also uses other measures  such as net income 
because the definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda or similar measures may vary among companies and industries  they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies

net realized gains on the sale of investments increased by million 
service and administrative fee income for the core business was million above prior year and resulted from increased debt cancellation and service fees primarily in the consumer finance channel 
ceding commission increased million due to additional service and administrative fees from increased insurance production in these increases were offset by lower net investment income on our portfolio of million due to lower investment yields 
in addition  underwriting revenue was million below prior year and resulted from increased commissions in the consumer finance channel and an increase in loss ratio in our risk retained business 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily from the acquisitions of continental and united  which added million of revenue  along with increased ceding commission revenue of million due to favorable underwriting results and a realized gain on the sale of assets attributable to our proportionate share of assets sold by our re insurers 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from million in expenses associated with being a public company  million in non recurring expenses and additional stock based compensation expense of million

operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million or  to million from million for the year ended december  this primarily resulted from additional expenses of million from our acquisition of pacific benefits group and higher expenses related to being a public company which was offset by lower personnel costs and variable costs for processing and fulfillment associated with the decline in revenue

goodwill by business segment during  we determined the final valuations for continental  united and auto knight and reduced the amount of goodwill associated with these acquisitions by million  million and million  respectively  to reflect the final valuation of goodwill acquired 
also  in july  we sold cirg  which reduced goodwill in the bpo segment by approximately million 
the following table shows goodwill assigned to each business segment at in thousands december  payment protection summit partners transactions darby associates continental united auto knight total payment protection bpo summit partners transactions pbg total bpo brokerage bliss glennon south bay ereinsure total brokerage total goodwill liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations  including working capital needs  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions and other commitments and contractual obligations 
we historically have derived our liquidity from our invested assets  cash flow from operations  ordinary and extraordinary dividend capacity from our subsidiary insurance companies  revolving credit facility and equity investments 
when considering our liquidity  it is important to note that we hold cash in a fiduciary capacity as a result of premiums received from insured parties that have not yet been paid to insurance carriers 
the fiduciary cash is recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability  net of our commissions  to insurance carriers 
our primary cash requirements include the payment of our operating expenses  interest and principal payments on our debt  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we may also incur unexpected costs and operating expenses related to any unforeseen disruptions to our facilities and equipment  the loss of key personnel or changes in the credit markets and interest rates  which could increase our immediate cash requirements or otherwise impact our liquidity 
our primary sources of liquidity are our total investments  cash and cash equivalent balances  availability under our revolving credit facility and dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries 
at december   we had total investments of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had total investments of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and million of available capacity on our revolving credit facilities 
our total indebtedness was million at december  compared to million at december  during the year ended december   we paid off the entire million of redeemable preferred stock outstanding thereby reducing a high rate funding source 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and our availability under our revolving credit facility  combined with our low capital expenditure requirements will provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business over the next several years 
we intend to use a portion of our available cash flow to pay interest on our outstanding debt  thus limiting the amount available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
as we continue to expand our business and make acquisitions  we may in the future require additional working capital to meet our future business needs 
this additional working capital may be in the form of additional debt or equity 
although we believe we have sufficient liquidity under our revolving credit facility  as discussed above  under extreme market conditions or in the event of a default under our revolving credit facility  there can be no assurance that such funds would be available or sufficient  and in such a case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all  or replace our existing revolving credit facility which matures in june of common stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a share repurchase plan 
the share repurchase plan allows us to purchase up to million of our common stock to be purchased from time to time through open market or private transactions 
the plan provides for shares to be repurchased for general corporate purposes  which may include serving as a subsequent resource for funding potential acquisitions and employee benefit plans 
the timing  price and quantity of purchases are at our discretion  and the plan may be discontinued or suspended at any time 
in  we repurchased a total of  shares at an average price of per share at a total cost of million

regulatory requirements we are a holding company and have limited direct operations 
our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries  including statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries  as well as payments under our tax allocation agreement and management agreements with our subsidiaries 
the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay such dividends and to make such other payments are limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled  which vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company 
along with solvency regulations  the primary factor in determining the amount of capital available for potential dividends is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from am best for our insurance company subsidiaries 
given recent economic events that have affected the insurance industry  both regulators and rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria  including increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries which  in turn  could negatively affect our capital resources 
the following table sets forth the dividends paid to us by our insurance company subsidiaries for the following periods years ended december  in thousands ordinary dividends extraordinary dividends total dividends million revolving credit facility in june  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with suntrust bank  which matures in june the facility 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate determined based upon the higher of i the prime rate  ii the federal funds rate plus or iii libor plus  plus a margin tied to our leverage ratio 
we can select at our discretion to convert the interest rate for all or a portion of the outstanding balance for a period of up to six months to a fixed euro dollar funding rate which is equal to the adjusted libor rate for the elected interest period in effect at the time of election  plus a margin tied to our leverage ratio 
on november   columbus bank trust  a division of synovus bank  entered into a joinder agreement to the revolving credit facility and became a new lender under the revolving credit facility with a revolving commitment of million  which increased the size of the facility to million 
on march   wells fargo bank  na  entered into a joinder agreement the wells fargo joinder to the facility to become a new lender under the facility with a revolving commitment of million  thereby increasing the size of the facility from million to million 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of between and based upon our leverage ratio on the unused portion of the facility 
the purpose of the facility is for working capital and acquisitions 
interest on the line of credit is payable monthly 
our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries  other than south bay and the regulated insurance subsidiaries 
under the facility  we may not assign  sell  transfer or dispose of any collateral or effect certain changes to its capital structure and the capital structure of our subsidiaries without the agent s prior consent 
our obligations under the facility may be accelerated or the commitments terminated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the facility  including payment defaults  defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants  the inaccuracy of representations or warranties  bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults  cross defaults to other material indebtedness  defaults arising in connection with changes in control and other customary events of default

thereafter  interest on the preferred trust securities will be at a rate of month libor plus for each interest rate period 
we are not permitted to redeem the preferred trust securities until after the june interest payment date 
after such date  we may redeem the preferred trust securities  in whole or in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of such preferred trust securities outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest 
interest is payable quarterly 
on april   we entered into a forward interest rate swap with wells fargo bank  na  pursuant to which we swapped the floating rate portion of our million in outstanding preferred trust securities to a fixed rate of per annum payable quarterly resulting in an effective rate of after adding the applicable margin of

also issued million of subordinated debentures to affiliates of summit partners  a related party  maturing december with an interest rate of per annum on the principal amount of such subordinated debentures 
in december  we utilized a portion of the proceeds from the ipo to repay the entire million of subordinated debentures for million  which included accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
redeemable preferred stock during the year ended december   we paid off the million of our series a  b and c redeemable preferred stock that was outstanding at december  in december  the company served notice to the holders of series a  b and c redeemable preferred stock of the intent to redeem the entire amount of each class of redeemable preferred stock  totaling million 
the early redemption of all outstanding a  b and c redeemable preferred stock began in january in addition  the series a  b and c redeemable preferred stock ceased accruing dividends on january  in conjunction with the redemption  the company recorded a million redemption premium during invested assets our invested assets consist mainly of high quality investments in fixed maturity securities  short term investments  and a smaller allocation of common and preferred equity securities 
we believe that prudent levels of investments in equity securities within our investment portfolio are likely to enhance long term after tax total returns without significantly increasing the risk profile of the portfolio 
we regularly review our entire portfolio in the context of macroeconomic and capital market conditions 
at december   the overall credit quality of the investment portfolio was rated a by standard and poor s rating service 
regulatory requirements our investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind  quality and concentration of investments 
in general  these laws and regulations permit investments  within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications  in federal  state and municipal obligations  corporate bonds  preferred and common equity securities  mortgage loans  real estate and other investments 
investment strategy our investment policy and strategy is reviewed and approved by the board of directors of each of our insurance subsidiaries on a regular basis in order to review and consider investment activities  tactics and new investment opportunities 
our investment strategy seeks long term returns through disciplined security selection  portfolio diversity and an integrated approach to risk management 
we select and monitor investments to balance the goals of safety  stability  liquidity  growth and after tax total return with the need to comply with regulatory investment requirements 
our investment portfolio is managed by a third party provider of asset management services  which specializes in the insurance sector 
asset liability management is accomplished by setting an asset target duration range that is influenced by the following factors i the estimated reserve payout pattern  ii the inclusion of our tactical capital market views into the investment decision making process and iii our overall risk tolerance 
we aim to achieve a relatively safe and stable income stream by maintaining a broad based portfolio of investment grade fixed maturity securities 
these holdings are supplemented by investments in additional asset types with the objective of further enhancing the portfolio s diversification and expected returns 
these additional asset types include common and redeemable preferred stock 
we manage our investment risks through consideration of duration of liabilities  diversification  credit limits  careful analytic review of each investment decision  and comprehensive risk assessments of the overall portfolio 
as of december   we held fixed maturity and equity securities in unrealized loss positions 
we do not intend to sell these investments and we believe we will be able to hold these securities until full recovery of their amortized cost basis for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities  although we can give no assurances 
for the year ended december   management deemed that equity securities were other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
as of december   there were fixed maturity and equity securities in unrealized loss positions 
during  based on its quarterly review  management deemed equity securities to be other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effective risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both our customers and stockholders interests 
we are exposed to potential losses from various market risks  in particular interest rate risk and credit risk 
additionally  we are exposed to inflation risk  and concentration risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the possibility that the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interest rates  including changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors 
interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets  such as fixed maturity securities  mortgage backed and asset backed securities primarily in the united states 
there are two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk 
price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of these investments fall  and conversely  as interest rates fall  the market value of these investments rises 
reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
as interest rates fall  an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment 
conversely  as interest rates rise  a decrease in prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
increases or decreases in interest rates could also impact interest payable under our variable rate indebtedness 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility with suntrust at an interest rate of 
our revolving credit facility allows the company to select from various borrowing terms and rates that best fit the company s interest rate risk profile and funding requirements 
we have the ability to manage interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on our debt obligations 
in april  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap transaction to convert the floating rate portion of our preferred trust securities to a fixed rate  commencing in june and expiring in june credit risk credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when they become due 
we assume counterparty credit risk in many forms 
a counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us 
primarily  our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed maturity investment portfolio and  to a lesser extent  in our reinsurance receivables 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily from customers  as a holder of fixed maturity securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions 
our risk management strategy and investment strategy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer 
we attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit quality 
we are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers 
when we reinsure  we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our payment protection business segments 
at december   approximately of our million of reinsurance receivables were protected from credit risk by using various types of risk mitigation mechanisms such as collateral trusts  letters of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement  compared to million or at december  for recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms  we are dependent solely on the ability of the reinsurer to satisfy claims 
occasionally  the creditworthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable 
the majority of our reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated a or better by am best 
concentration risk concentration risk is the risk that results from a lack of diversification due to a concentrated exposure on a small number of clients  limited market penetration  or reduced geographic coverage 
a significant portion  at december  compared to at december   of our bpo revenues are attributable to one client  national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh  pa 
any loss of business from or change in our relationship with this client could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to mitigate this risk  we intend to expand our bpo client base 
we have two additional forms of concentration risk i geographic almost two thirds of our brokerage segment is in california and ii channel distribution risk almost half of our payment protection revenue is in the consumer finance distribution channel 
our risk mitigation strategies are to continue to expand geographically in our brokerage segment and to continue to increase the volume of business through other distribution channels in our payment protection segment 
inflation risk inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings 
this typically happens when either invested assets or liabilities  but not both are indexed to inflation 
inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations in the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements
