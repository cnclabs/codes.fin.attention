item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our strategy regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in and is the managing general partner in regency centers  lp we are focused on achieving total shareholder returns in excess of reit shopping center averages  and sustaining growth in our net asset value and our earnings over an extended period of time 
we work to achieve these goals through owning  operating  and investing in a high quality portfolio of primarily grocery anchored shopping centers that are leased by market dominant grocers  category leading anchors  specialty retailers  and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities 
all of our operating  investing  and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as co investment partnerships or joint ventures 
the parent company currently owns approximately of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 
at december   we directly owned shopping centers the consolidated properties located in states representing million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
through co investment partnerships  we own partial ownership interests in shopping centers the unconsolidated properties located in states and the district of columbia representing million square feet of gla 
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores  major retail anchors  side shop retailers  and restaurants  including ground leasing or selling building pads out parcels to these same types of tenants 
historically  we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 
increasing occupancy in our shopping centers to historical levels and achieving positive rental rate growth are key objectives of our strategic plan 
at december   the consolidated operating shopping centers were leased  as compared to at december  during the recession of  we experienced occupancy declines in our shopping centers  which stabilized during as the economy continued its recovery  and increased during during  we began replacing weaker tenants with financially stronger tenants that we expect will contribute to the overall success of our shopping centers 
we continue to produce higher levels of new leasing activity and fewer tenant defaults as compared to and  and move outs of weaker tenants hurt by the recession appear to be on the decline 
however  economic uncertainties arising in europe could negatively impact the us economy  the operations of the tenants in our shopping centers  and consequently future operations and cash flows of our shopping centers 
rental rate changes have varied by market during as certain markets continue to experience a decline in market rates due to previous tenant s rental rates being above market  while other markets rates are stabilized or increasing 
we expect this market variability to continue during during and  average rental rates from new and renewal leasing in the combined portfolio for spaces vacant less than months grew in and declined in we expect average rental rates from new and renewal leases to decline or grow in a range of to 
we continue to closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers  especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition  business practice  and store closings in other locations 
we also evaluate consumer preferences  shopping behaviors  and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may effect our tenants 
we continue to monitor tenants who have co tenancy clauses in their lease agreements 
these tenants are typically located in larger format community shopping centers that contain multiple anchor tenants whose leases contain these types of clauses 
co tenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their store  they may allow a tenant the opportunity to close their store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes their store prior to lease expiration  or more commonly  they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 
as economic weakness persists in geographic areas where we have centers that contain leases with these types of clauses  we could experience reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their co tenancy clauses 
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development 
we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities  market presence  and anchor relationships to invest in value added opportunities sourced from land owners and joint venture partners  the redevelopment of existing centers  and the development of land 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers  resulting in modern shopping centers with long term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process typically requires three to five years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up  and stabilization of rental income  but can take longer depending upon tenant demand for new stores and the size of the project 
we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including new debt  equity and through capital recycling 
capital recycling involves identifying non strategic assets from our real estate portfolio and selling those in the open market  and reinvesting the sale proceeds into new higher quality developments and acquisitions that will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns 
co investment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions  as well as  the opportunity to earn fees for asset management  property management  and other investing and financing services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co investment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we wholly own 
co investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us 
although selling properties to co investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest  it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share  to the extent of our ownership interest  in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long term investment strategy 
shopping center portfolio the following table summarizes general information related to the consolidated properties in our shopping center portfolio december  december  number of properties properties in development gross leasable area leased operating and development leased operating the following table summarizes general information related to the unconsolidated properties owned in co investment partnerships in our shopping center portfolio december  december  number of properties properties in development gross leasable area leased operating and development leased operating we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through diversification which we achieve by geographically diversifying our shopping centers  avoiding dependence on any single property  market  or tenant  and owning a portion of our shopping centers through co investment partnerships 
the following table summarizes our four largest tenants  each of which is a grocery tenant  occupying our shopping centers at december  grocery anchor number of stores percentage of company owned gla percentage of annualized base rent kroger publix safeway supervalu includes stores owned by grocery anchors that are attached to our centers 
includes regency s pro rata share of unconsolidated properties and excludes those owned by anchors 
although base rent is supported by long term lease contracts  tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores 
in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues 
we are closely monitoring industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales  lack of credit  changes in retail formats or increased competition 
as a result of our findings  we may reduce new leasing  suspend leasing  or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of our tenants 
we communicate often with those tenants who have announced store closings or filed bankruptcy 
we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues  and no tenant represents more than of our annual base rent on a pro rata basis 
blockbuster video represents our largest tenant currently in bankruptcy 
as of february  we had leases with blockbuster in the combined portfolio  leases of which expire in assuming these stores continue through their lease expiration date  we would expect to receive base rent of approximately  during including our pro rata share of those leases in the unconsolidated properties 
liquidity and capital resources our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership 
the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units 
all debt is issued by our operating partnership or by our co investment partnerships 
accordingly  the discussion below regarding liquidity and capital resources is presented on a pro rata basis for the company 
the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating  investing  and financing activities of the company for the years ended december    and in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents on december  our cash balance was million 
we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities  before the effect of the derivative instruments settled in and and funded through financing activity  will provide the necessary funds to pay our scheduled mortgage loan principal payments  capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers  and distributions to our share and unit holders 
the following table summarizes these amounts for the years ended december    and in thousands cash flow from operations settlement of derivative instruments total scheduled principal payments capital expenditures to maintain shopping centers dividend distributions to share and unit holders total our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitor our financial position 
our board of directors recently declared our quarterly dividend of per share  payable february  to stock and unit holders of record as of february  our dividend has remained unchanged since may we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that  at a minimum  meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets 
at december   of our real estate assets were unencumbered 
such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on our million unsecured line of credit the line 
our debt to asset ratio before the effect of accumulated depreciation  including our pro rata share of the debt and assets of joint ventures  is at december   a decline from our ratio at december  of  due to the settlement of our forward sale agreements forward equity offering in march our coverage ratio  including our pro rata share of our partnerships  was times for the year ended december  as compared to times for the year ended december  we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 
at december   commitments available to us under the line totaled million  which had an outstanding balance of million 
the line was renewed in september  and now matures in september in february  a million revolving credit facility expired with no balance outstanding and we did not renew this facility 
on november   the company closed on a million unsecured term loan agreement term loan  which matures in december  and had no outstanding balance as of december  on january   million of unsecured debt matured  and we repaid the maturity by borrowing on the line 
on march   we received net proceeds of million from the settlement of the million common share forward equity offering and used a portion of the proceeds to payoff the balance of the line 
during  we estimate that we will require approximately million primarily to repay million of maturing debt excluding scheduled principal payments  and million for in process development costs and capital contributions to our co investment partnerships for repayment of debt 
to meet these cash requirements  we plan to use funds from our existing line and term loan  and when the capital markets are favorable  by issuing long term fixed rate debt and common equity 
in january  we borrowed million on the term loan and in combination with proceeds drawn on the line  repaid million unsecured debt maturing january  a more detailed schedule about our maturing loans is included below under contractual obligations 
during  we acquired five shopping centers for million  including our pro rata share of acquisitions completed by our co investment partnerships 
although we may fund acquisitions from various capital sources  a primary source of funds would come from capital recycling by selling shopping centers that no longer meet our investment criteria 
during  we sold shopping centers for million  including our pro rata share of sales completed by our co investment partnerships 
relying on property sales as a substantial capital source to fund our acquisition program is subject to numerous risks including the inherent difficulties in selling properties in the current market  or selling properties at higher initial returns than planned  thereby limiting our ability to source the necessary funds to acquire dominate infill shopping centers consistent with our capital recycling strategy 
capital recycling may also be dilutive to our earnings given that dominate infill shopping centers that we would target for acquisition may have lower initial returns than many of the properties that we would target for sale 
at december   we had seven development properties that were either under construction or in lease up  which when completed  will represent a net investment of million after projected sales of adjacent land and out parcels 
this compares to development properties at december   representing an investment of million upon completion 
we estimate that we will earn an average return on investment from our current development projects of when completed and fully leased 
costs necessary to complete in process development projects  net of reimbursements and projected land sales  are estimated to be million 
during  the co investment partnerships repaid million of debt through new mortgage loan financings and partner capital contributions 
at december   our joint ventures had million of scheduled secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing in these maturities will be repaid from proceeds from new mortgage loan financings of million currently committed  million expected refinancing and million of partner capital contributions of which regency s pro rata share is million 
we believe that our joint venture partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements 
we communicate with our co investment partners regularly regarding the operating and capital budgets of our co investment partnerships  and believe that we will successfully complete the refinancing of our joint venture debt as it matures in the future 
in the event that a co investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co investment partnership  we would have the right  but not the obligation  to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call at an interest rate at the lesser of prime plus a pre defined spread or the maximum rate allowed by law 
a decision to loan to a defaulting joint venture partner  which would be secured by the defaulting partner s partnership interest  would be based on the fair value of the co investment partnership assets  our joint venture partner s financial health  and would be subject to an evaluation of our own capital commitments and sources to fund those commitments 
alternatively  should we determine that our joint venture partners will not have sufficient capital to meet future capital needs  we could trigger liquidation of the partnership 
for the co investment partnerships that have distribution in kind dik provisions  and own multiple properties  a liquidation of the co investment partnership could be completed by either a dik of the properties to each joint venture partner in proportion to its partnership interest  open market sale  or a combination of both methods 
our co investment partnership properties have been financed with non recourse loans that represent of the total debt of the co investment partnerships including lines of credit as of december  we and our partners have no guarantees related to these loans 
in those co investment partnerships which have dik provisions  if we trigger liquidation by dik  each partner would receive title to properties selected in a rotation process for distribution and would assume any related loans secured by the properties distributed 
the loan agreements generally provide for assumption by either joint venture partner after obtaining any required lender consent 
we would only be responsible for those loans we assume through the dik and only to the extent of the value of the property we receive  since after assumption through the dik the loans would remain non recourse 
although common or preferred equity raised in the public markets by the parent company is an option to fund future capital needs  access to these markets could be limited at times 
when conditions for the issuance of securities are acceptable  we will evaluate issuing debt or equity to fund new acquisition opportunities  fund new developments  or repay maturing debt 
at december   the parent company and the operating partnership have an existing universal shelf registration statement available for the issuance of new equity and debt securities 
see note  equity and capital  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion of the company s capital structure 
our preferred stock and preferred units  though callable by us  are not redeemable in cash at the option of the holders 
on february   the company announced it would redeem all issued and outstanding shares of the parent company s series and series cumulative redeemable preferred stock on march  the company expects to reduce net income available to common stockholders through a non cash charge of million at redemption 
on february   the operating partnership purchased all of its issued and outstanding series d preferred units  at discount to par  resulting in an increase to net income available to common stockholders of approximately  on february   the parent company issued million shares of series cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share 
investments in real estate partnerships at december   we had investments in real estate partnerships of million

the difference between regency s share of the net assets of the co investment partnerships and the company s investments in real estate partnerships per the accompanying consolidated balance sheets relates primarily to differences in inside outside basis as further described in note to consolidated financial statements 
investments in real estate partnerships are primarily composed of co investment partnerships in which we currently invest with five co investment partners and a closed end real estate fund regency retail partners or the fund  as further summarized below 
in addition to earning our pro rata share of net income or loss in each of these co investment partnerships  we receive recurring market based fees for asset management  property management  and leasing as well as fees for investment and financing services  which were million  million and million for the years ended december    and respectively

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities other than our co investment partnerships or other persons  also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed 
our co investment partnership properties have been financed with non recourse loans 
the company has no guarantees related to these loans 
critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon  but not limited to  our judgments about historical results  current economic activity  and industry accounting standards 
they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness  however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
accounts receivable minimum rent  percentage rent  and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes are the company s principal source of revenue 
as a result of generating this revenue  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
to address the collectability of these receivables  we analyze historical write off experience  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
real estate and long lived assets acquisition of real estate assets upon acquisition of real estate operating properties  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building  building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships  assumed debt  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition  based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date 
based on these estimates  the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities 
fair value is determined based on an exit price approach  which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
if  up to one year from the acquisition date  information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis 
the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 
cost capitalization we capitalize the acquisition of land  the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in summary  a project changes from non operating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy 
at that time  costs are no longer capitalized 
other development costs include pre development costs essential to the development of the property  as well as  interest  real estate taxes  and direct employee costs incurred during the development period 
pre development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits  legal  engineering  and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
at december  and  the company had capitalized pre development costs of million and  respectively  of which million and  respectively  were refundable deposits 
if we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence is no longer probable  we immediately expense all related capitalized pre development costs not considered recoverable 
during the years ended december    and  we expensed pre development costs of approximately   and million  respectively  recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended 
we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond months after substantial completion of the building shell 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized interest of million  million  and million  respectively  on our development projects 
we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program 
all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized million  million  and million  respectively  of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program 
the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring 
if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur additional increases in general and administrative expenses which would further reduce net income 
valuation of real estate assets we evaluate whether there are any indicators  including property operating performance and general market conditions  that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable 
through the evaluation  we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
our estimated cash flows is based on several key assumptions  including rental rates  costs of tenant improvements  leasing commissions  anticipated hold period  and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition  including the exit capitalization rate 
these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 
changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the company s financial condition or operating performance 
the fair value of real estate assets is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available  or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors  and therefore are subject to a significant degree of management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value 
in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land  we generally use market data and comparable sales information

a provision for impairment was recognized during the year ended december  of million  related primarily to two operating properties 
these properties exhibited weak operating fundamentals  including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time  which lead to the impairment

general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher levels of compensation earned in for higher levels of performance as compared to provision for doubtful accounts decreased in as compared to due to significantly improved tenant collection rates and fewer tenant defaults 
the decrease in other expenses is due to a million tax benefit incurred in  as compared to tax expense of million incurred in  as well as a reduction in pre development costs written off as a result of pursuing less new development activity during the following table presents the change in interest expense in thousands change interest on notes payable interest on line of credit capitalized interest hedge interest interest income interest on line of credit decreased as a result of lower outstanding balances during as compared to capitalized interest decreased as a result of a reduced development activity as compared to  and a higher level of shopping center completions during a provision for impairment was recognized during the year ended december  of million  which was a decrease of million from the impairment provision recorded in the impairment provision recorded in was a result of identifying properties that had been previously considered held for long term investment and determining that they no longer met our long term investment strategy

as a result  we reevaluated and reduced the probability of future development at these sites and accordingly reduced our carrying value in the land parcels to estimated fair value of the land 
included in the impairment provision recorded during were operating properties that were subjected to the same investment criteria evaluation that we applied during  and we accordingly reduced our carrying value on those properties to estimated fair value based upon a change in expected holding periods 
if we sell a property or classify a property as held for sale  we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations 
all of the million provision was recorded in continuing operations for the year ended december  and of the million provision recorded during the year ended december   million was reclassified into discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we sold eleven out parcels for net proceeds of million and recognized a gain of approximately  as compared to where we sold out parcels for net proceeds of million and recognized a gain of approximately  during  we recognized approximately  in contingent gains related to three properties sold to the usaa partnership during during  we sold eight operating properties to the usaa partnership for net proceeds of million and recognized gains of million recorded under the restricted gain method as further described in note  significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships changed by million during the year ended december   as compared to as follows in thousands ownership change macquarie countrywide regency mcwr i gri regency  llc grir macquarie countrywide regency iii  llc mcwr iii macquarie countrywide regency desco  llc mcwr desco columbia regency retail partners  llc columbia i columbia regency partners ii  llc columbia ii cameron village  llc cameron regcal  llc regcal regency retail partners  lp the fund us regency retail i  llc usaa other investments in real estate partnerships total at december   our ownership interest in mcwr i was 
the liquidation of mcwr i was complete december  at december   our ownership interest in grir formerly macquarie countrywide regency ii  llc was 
the change in our equity loss in investments in real estate partnerships  compared to  is related to increasing our ownership interest in grir effective january  to from our ownership interest in  combined with similar positive trends that we experienced in the consolidated properties as they relate to increases in base rent  reductions in provisions for doubtful accounts  higher termination fees and lower provisions for impairment 
during  our pro rata share of the impairment reserves recorded in the real estate partnerships was million as compared to million in during  impairment provisions were primarily incurred and recorded by grir  however  during  impairment provisions  which were significantly lower in grir and contributed to grir s reduction in equity loss  were higher in columbia i and the fund  which contributed to the equity losses reported by these two partnerships in income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  and includes million in gains  net of taxes  from the sale of two operating properties and one property in development for net proceeds of million and the operations of the shopping centers sold or classified as held for sale in and income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  and includes million in gains from the sale of one operating property and four properties in development for net proceeds of million and the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as held for sale in and related to our parent company s results  our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million  an increase in net income of million as compared with the net loss of million for the year ended december  the higher net income was primarily related to a lower provision for impairment recorded during as compared to  moderate improvement in our operating fundamentals impacting base rent  but partially offset by lower gains realized in on sales of operating properties  and higher interest expense 
our diluted net loss per share was in as compared to diluted net loss per share of in related to our operating partnership results  our net loss attributable to common unit holders for the year ended december  was million  an increase in net income of million as compared with the net loss of million for the year ended december  for the same reasons stated above 
our diluted net loss per unit was for the year ended december  as compared to net loss per unit of for the year ended december  environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry  the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers  and underground petroleum storage tanks 
we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations 
generally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to non chlorinated solvent systems 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance  where possible  on specific properties with known contamination  in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites 
we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 
we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be million and million  all of which has been accrued as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity  or results of operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  more recent data suggests inflation will eventually become a greater concern as the economy continues to recover from the recent recession 
substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
however  during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness  minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines 
occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 
we have a million unsecured line of credit the line commitment and a million unsecured term loan the term loan commitment  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon a variable interest rate of libor plus basis points and our term loan has a variable interest rate of libor plus basis points 
libor rates charged on our line commitment and our term loan collectively our unsecured credit facilities change monthly 
the spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings 
if our credit ratings are downgraded  the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase  resulting in higher interest costs 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing long term fixed rate debt 
the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection 
during  we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps the swaps totaling million with fixed rates of    and 
at inception  we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to lock in the underlying treasury rates on million of fixed rate financing that was expected to occur in and during  we paid million to partially settle million of the swaps in place to hedge the million mortgage loan issued on july  on june   we paid million to partially settle million of the remaining million swaps in place to hedge the million ten year senior unsecured notes issued on june  on september   we paid million to settle the remaining million of swaps to hedge the million ten year senior unsecured notes issued on october  during  the company  through a consolidated co investment partnership  entered an interest rate swap on a million variable rate secured loan maturing on september  to fix the interest rate 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized expense of  and income of million  respectively  for changes in hedge ineffectiveness 
we have million of fixed rate debt maturing in and that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of  which includes million of unsecured long term debt that matures in january we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments 
based upon the current capital markets  our current credit ratings  our current capacity under our line and term loan  and the number of high quality  unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings  we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 
in january we borrowed the on our line and term loan to repay the million unsecured debt maturing in january our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december   by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table  those rates represent rates that existed at december  and are subject to change on a monthly basis 
the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
since firm commitments are not presented  the table has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and actual interest rates 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate for all fixed rate debt variable rate libor debt average interest rate for all variable rate debt average interest rates at the end of each year presented
