the effective income tax rate for fy is approximately resulting in the million income tax expense  as compared to an effective income tax rate of in fy which resulted in the million income tax expense 
the effective tax rate decreased from fy to fy due to increased aggregate earnings attributable to our non controlling interests  for which we do not pay taxes 
the increase in aggregate earnings attributable to our non controlling interest relates to our acquisition of the ecko assets in october  for which we have a full year of earnings in fy  and our acquisition of the peanuts assets in june  for which there were no comparable earnings in fy net income 
our net income was million in fy  compared to net income of million in fy  as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our principal capital requirements have been to fund acquisitions  working capital needs  and to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
we have historically relied on internally generated funds to finance our operations and our primary source of capital needs for acquisition has been the issuance of debt and equity securities 
at december  and december   our cash totaled million and million  respectively  including short term restricted cash of million and million  respectively 
our term loan facility  which was fully extinguished in may see below  required us to repay the principal amount of the term loan facility outstanding in an amount equal to of the excess cash flow of the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility for the most recently completed fiscal year  unless we meet certain criteria specified by a financial covenant defined in the term loan facility 
as of december  our ratio of consolidated total debt as defined by the term loan facility to consolidated ebitda as defined by the term loan facility was below to  which eliminated the obligation to pay of the excess cash flow from the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility for on march   we paid to barclays  for the benefit of the lenders  million  which was an optional prepayment 
on may   approximately million was paid to barclays as administrative agent  for the benefit of the term loan facility lenders  representing the company s full satisfaction of all obligations under the term loan facility  including the outstanding principal and accrued interest due to the term loan facility lenders as of may  in november we entered into the revolver with several banks and other financial institutions which provides us a revolving line of credit in an aggregate principal amount of million  with a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
further details of this revolver can be found below in our discussion of obligations and commitments 
we believe that cash from future operations  our currently available cash and our ability to draw down additional funds under our revolver will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  which takes into account the repayment of million face value of principal outstanding on our convertible notes due june we intend to continue financing future brand acquisitions through a combination of cash from operations  bank financing and the issuance of additional equity and or debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of certain prior financings consummated by us 
changes in working capital at december  and december  the working capital ratio current assets to current liabilities was to and to  respectively 
this decrease was driven primarily by an increase in the current portion of long term debt related to our convertible notes due june  as well as million paid in full satisfaction of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility as mentioned above  million of net cash paid as part of the ed hardy transaction in april  million of net cash paid as part of the zoo york transaction in july  and million of cash paid for the acquisition of sharper image 
the decrease was partially offset by our convertible notes offering in may from which we received million in net proceeds see below for details  as well as additional factors set forth below operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately million  from million in fy to million in the fy this increase in net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million is primarily due to an increase in net income of approximately million from million in fy to approximately million in fy for the reasons discussed above  as well as an increase in deferred income taxes of million from million in to million in fy  and an increase in the amortization of convertible notes discount of approximately million due to our new convertible notes 
these increases were partially offset by a non cash gain of million from the re measurement of our investment in hardy way as part of the transaction described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  an increase in equity earnings on joint ventures of approximately million driven primarily by our iconix china joint venture s gain related to the initial public offering of a company  a subsidiary of which iconix china had a minority investment  for which there is no comparable gain in fy  and a non cash pre tax loss of million in fy for the permanent write down of marketable securities  which consisted of auction rate securities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in fy decreased approximately million  from million in fy to million in fy this decrease is primarily due to million used in our acquisition of the peanuts assets in fy  offset by the following fy transactions i million used in the hardy way transaction  ii million used in the zoo york transaction  and iii million used in the sharper image transaction each transaction described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
further  in fy there were net distributions to our equity investment partners of approximately million  as compared to million in net distributions from equity partners in fy financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased million  from million of net cash used in financing activities in fy to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fy the main driver of this net increase of cash provided by financing activities of million was as a result of aggregate net cash received of million from our convertible notes offering  net of the cost of hedges and sale of warrants related to this offering 
this was offset by payments aggregating million in fy primarily related to the million payoff of the term loan facility  as compared to principal payments aggregating million in fy  of which million was for the term loan facility 
further  during fy we repurchased shares on the open market for approximately million as part of a stock repurchase plan  there were no repurchases of shares on the open market in fy also  in fy our non controlling interest partner in the peanuts holdings joint venture contributed million as part of the peanuts transaction and formation of the joint venture  as compared to our non controlling interest partner in the op japan joint venture who contributed million as part of the op japan transaction and formation of the joint venture

the success of our company  however  will still remain largely dependent on our ability to build and maintain brand awareness and contract with and retain key licensees and on our licensees ability to accurately predict upcoming fashion trends within their respective customer bases and fulfill the product requirements of their particular retail channels within the global marketplace 
unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the us economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  and other factors noted in risk factors  could adversely affect our licensees ability to meet and or exceed their contractual commitments to us and thereby adversely affect our future operating results 
effects of inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the past few years in the united states  where we primarily compete  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability

new accounting standards in may  fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
asu amends topic to provide common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
consequently  the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements  as well as providing guidance on how fair value should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within us gaap 
asu no 
is to be applied prospectively  and early adoption is not permitted 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in june  fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option that permits the presentation of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity and requires presenting components of net income and comprehensive income in either a one statement approach with totals for both net income and comprehensive income  or a two statement approach where a statement presenting the components of net income and total net income must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income  a total for other comprehensive income  and a total for comprehensive income 
for public companies  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 
early adoption is permitted 
we have elected early adoption of the two statement approach as of december  and retrospectively for all other periods presented 
see part iv item in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu simplifies how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asu no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu provides for additional disclosures of both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this scope would include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods  and disclosures required by these amendments should be provided retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu defers the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
asu did not defer the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the amendments are effective at the same time as the amendments in asu critical accounting policies several of our accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for collectability of accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectability considering historical  current and anticipated trends of our licensees related to deductions taken by customers and markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of our licensees and their retail customers 
due to our licensing model  we do not have any inventory risk and have reduced our operating risks  and can reasonably forecast revenues and plan expenditures based upon guaranteed royalty minimums and sales projections provided by our retail licensees 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any adjustments when necessary 
in connection with our licensing model  we have entered into various trademark license agreements that provide revenues based on minimum royalties and additional revenues based on a percentage of defined sales 
minimum royalty revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over each period  as defined  in each license agreement 
royalties exceeding the defined minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee s sales 
in june  the fasb issued guidance under asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon our adoption of this guidance  on february   we ceased amortizing goodwill 
as prescribed under this guidance  we had goodwill tested for impairment during the years  and  and no write downs from impairments were necessary 
our tests for impairment utilize discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair values of the individual assets 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates are as follow i discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks  ii royalty rates used in our trade mark valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trademark models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
these tests factor in economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
in december  the fasb issued guidance under asc topic consolidation as it relates to non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest previously referred to as minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity  not as a liability  in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statement of operations of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and the non controlling interest 
this guidance also establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation 
in april  the fasb issued guidance within asc topic  business combinations 
asc topic amends the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this guidance is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
for the years  and there was no impairment present for these long lived assets 
effective january   we adopted guidance under asc topic compensation stock compensation  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
under this guidance  using the modified prospective method  compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  prior to the adoption of this guidance  we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  the compensation cost for stock options had been measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we account for income taxes in accordance with guidance under asc topic income taxes 
under this guidance  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management reviews both positive and negative evidence pursuant to the requirements of this guidance  including current and historical results of operations  the annual limitation on utilization of net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to internal revenue code section  future income projections and the overall prospects of our business 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our completed transition into a licensing business  estimates of future profitability based on projected royalty revenues from our licensees  and the overall prospects of our business  management concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized 
we adopted guidance under asc topic  beginning january   as it relates to uncertain tax positions 
the implementation of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the total unrecognized tax benefit was million at the date of adoption 
at december   the total unrecognized tax benefit was million 
however  this unrecognized tax benefit is not recognized for accounting purposes because the related deferred tax asset has been fully reserved in prior years 
we are continuing our practice of recognizing interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
there was no accrual for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for the year ended december  we file federal and state tax returns and we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for fiscal years prior to marketable securities  which are accounted for as available for sale  are stated at fair value in accordance with guidance under asc topic debt and equity securities  and consisted of auction rate securities 
temporary changes in fair market value are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss  whereas other than temporary markdowns were realized through our statement of operations 
on january   we adopted guidance under asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurement 
while this guidance does not require any new fair value measurements in its application to other accounting pronouncements  it does emphasize that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 
due to the bankruptcy of the insurer of the auction rate securities  which reduced the market value of the insurer s preferred securities to zero  we estimated the fair value of our auction rate securities to be zero 
we believe this decrease in fair value is permanent due to the aforementioned bankruptcy 
the effect of the failure to auction since the third quarter of fiscal and the aforementioned bankruptcy has resulted in pre tax loss of million in the fourth quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by requiring the majority of our licenses to be denominated in us dollars 
our note receivable due from the purchasers of the canadian trademark for joe boxer is denominated in canadian dollars 
if there were an adverse change in the exchange rate from canadian dollars to us dollars of less than  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
certain other licenses are denominated in japanese yen 
to mitigate interest rate risks  we have purchased derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts to convert certain portions of our revenue and cash received in yen to fixed exchange rates 
if there were an adverse change in the exchange rate from japanese yen to us dollars of  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
we invested in certain auction rate securities  herein referred to as ars 
beginning in the third quarter of and through december   our balance of ars failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders  and the insurer of the ars exercised its put option to replace the underlying securities of the ars with its preferred securities 
further  although the ars had paid cash dividends according to their stated terms  the payments of cash dividends ceased after july  and were only temporarily reinstated for the four week period from december  to january  the dividends would be resumed only if the board of directors of the insurer declared such cash dividends to be payable at a later date 
no further dividends were received 
in january  we commenced a lawsuit against the broker dealer of these ars alleging  among other things  fraud  and seeking full recovery of the million face value of the ars  as well as legal costs and punitive damages 
in november  the insurer filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
these funds will not be available to us unless we realize recovery through the bankruptcy process  settlement or legal judgment of the action brought against the broker dealer 
due to the bankruptcy of the insurer of the ars  which reduced the market value of its preferred securities to zero  we estimated the fair value of our ars to be zero 
we believe this cumulative decrease in fair value is permanent due to the aforementioned bankruptcy 
the cumulative effect of the failure to auction since the third quarter of fiscal through fy has resulted in pre tax loss of million which is reflected in the consolidated income statement as a loss on marketable securities in the fourth quarter of as described elsewhere in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in connection with the initial sale of our convertible notes  we entered into convertible note hedges with affiliates of merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated and lehman brothers inc at such time  the hedging transactions were expected  but were not guaranteed  to eliminate the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes 
concurrently  we entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties 
on september  and october   respectively  lehman brothers holdings inc  or lehman holdings  and its subsidiary  lehman brothers otc derivatives inc  or lehman otc  filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york  herein referred to as the bankruptcy court 
on september   we filed proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court relating to the lehman otc convertible note hedges 
we had purchased of these convertible note hedges from lehman otc  or the lehman note hedges  and we had sold of the warrants to lehman otc 
lehman otc s obligations under the lehman note hedges are guaranteed by lehman holdings 
if the lehman note hedges are rejected or terminated in connection with the lehman otc bankruptcy  we would have a claim against lehman otc and lehman holdings  as guarantor  for the damages and or close out values resulting from any such rejection or termination 
while we intend to pursue any claim for damages and or close out values resulting from the rejection or termination of the lehman note hedges  at this point in the lehman bankruptcy cases it is not possible to determine with accuracy the ultimate recovery  if any  that we may realize on potential claims against lehman otc or lehman holdings  as guarantor  resulting from any rejection or termination of the lehman note hedges 
we also do not know whether lehman otc will assume or reject the lehman note hedges  and therefore cannot predict whether lehman otc intends to perform its obligations under the lehman note hedges 
as a result  if lehman otc does not perform such obligations and the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price as adjusted of the convertible notes  the effective conversion price of the convertible notes which is higher than the actual conversion price due to these hedges would be reduced and our existing stockholders may experience dilution at the time or times the convertible notes are converted 
the extent of any such dilution would depend  among other things  on the then prevailing market price of our common stock and the number of shares of common stock then outstanding  but we believe the impact will not be material and will not affect our income statement presentation 
we are not otherwise exposed to counterparty risk related to the lehman bankruptcies 
we currently believe  although there can be no assurance  that the bankruptcy filings and their potential impact on these entities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we will continue to monitor the bankruptcy filings of lehman holdings and lehman otc 
moreover  in connection with the warrant transactions with the counterparties  to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants  the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock
