thimet is used on agricultural crops  mainly potatoes  corn  cotton  rice  sugarcane and peanuts  to protect against chewing and piercing sucking insects 
purchased assets included registrations  data  know how and certain inventories 
the acquisition was made in connection with the settlement of litigation between amvac and aceto ag 
on march   amvac acquired from bayer cropscience lp bcs lp certain assets at bcs lp s facility located in marsing  id  the marsing facility 
the marsing facility consists of approximately acres of improved real property  of which are now owned by amvac and two of which are leased by amvac from the city of marsing for a term of years

orthene is used on agricultural crops  including beans  brussels sprouts  cauliflower  celery  cotton  cranberries  head lettuce  mint and ornamental and forests 
amvac purchased the proprietary formulation information  registration rights  marketing materials  certain intellectual property rights and existing inventories of the agricultural and professional product lines 
seasonality the agricultural chemical industry in general is cyclical in nature 
the demand for amvac s products tends to be seasonal 
seasonal usage  however  does not necessarily follow calendar dates  but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
backlog amvac does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business 
amvac primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers 
customers tenkoz  crop production services  inc formerly united agri products  western farm services and crop production services  and winfield accounted for   and  respectively of the company s sales in   and in  and   and in 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data competition amvac faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers in its marketplaces 
competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on quality  efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of the quality and efficacy of its products  its price and the technical service and support given to its customers 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
in most cases  amvac has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets which are no longer addressed by larger companies 
intellectual property amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents 
further  amvac s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single trademark  license  or patent 
epa registrations amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra legislation 
the legislation makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states unless such pesticide has first been registered by the united states environmental protection agency usepa as well as under similar state laws 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to usepa registration and re registration requirements and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
this registration by usepa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of amvac s products are used require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used in that state 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the usepa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has furnished  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and respectively  related to gathering this information 
see also part ii  item of this annual report on form k for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 
raw materials amvac utilizes numerous companies as well as internal sources to supply the various raw materials and components used in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  amvac seeks to secure its supply by either long term multi year arrangements or purchasing on long lead times from its suppliers 
amvac believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers 
environmental during  amvac continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility the facility in commerce  ca 
an outline of the history of those activities follows 
in  the california department of toxic substances control dtsc conducted a resource conservation and recovery act rcra facility assessment rfa of those facilities having hazardous waste storage permits 
during that same year  ten underground storage tanks located at the facility were closed 
in march  the rfa culminated in dtsc accepting the facility into its expedited remedial action program 
under this program  the facility was required to prepare and implement an environmental investigation plan 
depending on the findings of the investigation  the facility might also be required to develop and implement remedial measures to address any historical environmental impairment 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data this activity then took two paths the rcra permit closure and the larger site characterization 
with respect to the permit closure  in  amvac began the formal process to close its hazardous waste permit at the facility which had allowed amvac to store hazardous waste longer than days as required by federal regulations 
formal regulatory closure actions began in and were completed in  as evidenced by dtsc s october  acknowledgement of amvac s closure certification report 
with respect to the site characterization  soil and groundwater characterization activities began in december in accordance with the site investigation plan that was approved by the dtsc 
additional activities were conducted from to with oversight provided by the dtsc 
additional analysis of groundwater and soil are being conducted in response to federally mandated initiatives of similarly affected sites 
area wide groundwater studies of perchlorate typically associated with rocket fuel  explosives and fertilizer require the facility and neighboring sites to monitor existing wells for perchlorate in groundwater 
risk assessment activities have commenced and are likely to conclude over the next year under the oversight of the dtsc  after which further investigation may be required  and the company will prepare and submit a remedial action plan 
until the remedial action plan has been submitted and comments are received from dtsc  it is uncertain whether the cost associated with further investigation and potential remediation activities will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
thus  the company is unable to determine whether remediation is reasonably probable  nor can the cost of remediation be reasonably estimated the scope can vary depending upon the risk assessment and many other factors 
accordingly  the company has not set up a loss contingency with respect thereto 
amvac is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at the commerce  ca  marsing  id  hannibal  mo and axis  al facilities 
amvac continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the usepa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on amvac s operations 
amvac expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
wherever feasible  amvac recovers raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs 
the company is committed to a long term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
as part of its continuing environmental program  the company has been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on its business 
employees as of december   the company employed approximately employees 
amvac  on an ongoing basis  due to the seasonality of its business  uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees

risk factors the regulatory climate has grown increasingly challenging to the company s interests both domestically and internationally 
under the current us administration  various agencies within the federal government have begun to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses or the expansion of such uses of older chemistries  including many of the company s products and  in some cases  have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses 
at the regulatory level  the principles of sound science to which the company has always subscribed have been adulterated  in some cases  by political considerations 
the challenge of the regulatory climate is even more pronounced in certain other geographical regions  most especially the european union and brazil  where the company faces resistance toward the continued use of certain of its products 
there is no guarantee that this climate will change in the near term 
nor is there any guarantee that the company will be able to maintain or expand the uses of many of its products in the face of these regulatory challenges 
the company is dependent upon certain sole source suppliers for certain of its active ingredients 
in conjunction with the purchase and or licensing of various product lines including folex  mocap  nemacur  impact and force  the company has been required by seller licensor to enter into multi year supply arrangements under which such counterparties are the sole source of either active ingredients or formulated end use product 
in some cases  the manufacturer has been unable to deliver the volume of product necessary to meet the company s demand 
further  certain manufacturers have expressed a desire to discontinue production of such goods earlier than anticipated 
in one case  the manufacturer has entered the market as a competitor 
there is no guarantee that these sole source manufacturers will be willing or able to supply these products to the company reliably  continuously and at the levels anticipated by the company or required by the market 
in addition  while the company is making efforts to transfer production of certain of these products to its own facilities  there is no guarantee that these initiatives will be successful or that they will be completed in a timely fashion so as to permit the company to meet market demand in the short to mid term 
if these sources prove to be unreliable and the company is not able to supplant or otherwise second source these manufacturers  it is possible that the company will not realize its projected sales  which  in turn  could adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company may be subject to environmental liabilities 
while the company expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials into the environment and to comply with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment and its workforce  federal and state authorities may nevertheless seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations 
further  these various governmental agencies could  among other things  impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from release of pesticides and other agents into the environment 
in addition  while the company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities  it cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company may be held liable for significant damages or fines 
in the event that such damages or fines are assessed  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial and operating results 
use of the company s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups 
use of agrochemical products  including the company s products is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal and state statutes  including fifra  the food quality protection act  endangered species act  and the clean water act  to name a few 
these challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the usepa and or other federal or state agencies  the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions  the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the company s interests  and or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by usepa in the course of registration  re registration or label expansion 
it is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed  resulting in a material adverse effect upon one or more of our products 
the company s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects 
demand for the company s products tends to be seasonal 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
the end user of its products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season  which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore may reduce our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address any adverse seasonal effects 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the company faces competition in certain markets from manufacturers of genetically modified seeds 
the company faces competition from larger chemical companies that market genetically modified gmo seeds in certain of the crop protection sectors in which the company competes  particularly that of corn 
many growers that have chosen to use gmo seeds have reduced their use of pesticides sold by the company 
further  the federally mandated refuge acre requirement for corn which  in the name of preventing pest resistance  required growers using gmo seeds to set aside a percentage of their planting acres for non gmo seed  has been sharply reduced 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain its market share or pricing levels in sectors that are subject to competition from gmo seed marketers or that federal mandates to set aside acreage for non gmo seed will continue 
the company faces competition from generic competitors that source product from countries having lower cost structures 
the company continues to face competition from competitors that enter the market through making offers to pay data compensation and subsequently sourcing material from countries having low cost structures typically india and china 
these competitors typically operate at thinner gross margins and  with low costs of goods  drive pricing and profitability of subject product lines downward 
further  such competitors typically spend little on product stewardship and employ few personnel within the united states 
in effect  they tend to commoditize all products which they distribute  that is  they operate by offering the lowest price goods 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain market share over generic competitors or that such competitors will not offer generic versions of the company s products in the future 
the company s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the company s larger competitors 
a significant portion of the company s products are sold to national distributors who also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the company 
typically  revenues from the sales of these competing product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the company s product lines 
further  these distributors are often under pressure to market competing product lines in favor of the company s 
in light of these facts  there is no assurance that such customers will market or continue to market our products aggressively or successfully or that the company will be able to influence such customers to purchase our products in favor of those of our competitors 
to the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities  the company may experience lower profitability 
the company has pursued a business strategy of acquiring manufacturing facilities at a steep discount to their replacement value 
these acquisitions have enabled the company to be more independent of overseas manufacturers than some of our competitors 
while the company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of these several facilities  our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors beyond our control  including fluctuating market conditions  product life cycles  weather conditions  availability of raw materials and regulatory constraints  among other things 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maximize its utilization of capacity at its manufacturing facilities 
to the extent that the company experiences excess manufacturing capacity  it may experience lower profitability 
reduced availability and higher prices of raw materials may reduce the company s profitability and could threaten the viability of some of its products 
in the recent past  there has been a material reduction in the number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the company in many of its products 
certain of these raw materials are available solely from sources overseas or from single sources domestically 
in the recent past  the price of these raw materials has fluctuated sharply 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to source some or all of these materials indefinitely or that it will be able to do so at a level of cost that will enable it to maintain its profit margin on its products

the company engages in global business transactions 
where possible  the company does business in its functional currency 
however  there are certain situations in which the company is unable to transact in its functional currency and engages in agreements that require settlement in a different currency 
the company may enter into derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk of these agreements 
that is to say  establish a forward exchange rate at the point of placing a purchase order and thereby insure the company against movement in exchange rate 
in addition  the company may use interest rate derivates to manage interest rate expense generated by variable rate debt 
the company has in place one fixed interest rate swap with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to movements in the libor rate over time 
this is required as a condition of the company s senior credit facilities agreement

bank of the west is the syndication manager for the company s loans and acts as the counterparty on the company s derivative transactions 
the company reviews the creditworthiness of its banks on a quarterly basis via credit agencies and also has face to face meetings with senior management of the banks 
management believes that the company has an excellent working relationship with bank of the west and the other financial institutions in the company s lender group 
in light of the uncertainties in global financial markets  there is no guarantee  however  that the company s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the company s working capital needs 
the distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation 
the company s products are subject to laws administered by federal  state and foreign governments  including regulations requiring registration  approval and labeling of its products 
the labeling requirements restrict the use of and type of application for our products 
more stringent restrictions could make our products less available  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to the usepa registration and re registration requirements  and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
such registration requirements are based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of the company s products are used also require registration before they can be marketed or used in that state 
governmental regulatory authorities have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on the company s products

there can be no assurance  however  that the usepa will not request certain tests or studies be repeated or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future 
the company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance 
the manufacturing of the company s products is subject to governmental regulations 
the company currently owns and operates three manufacturing facilities in los angeles  california  axis  alabama  and marsing  idaho and owns and has manufacturing services provided in a fourth facility in hannibal  missouri the facilities 
the facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by required licenses and permits by state and local authorities 
the manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the company s products occurs at the facilities 
an inability to renew or maintain a license or permit or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits could impede the company s access to key ingredients and increase the cost of production  which  in turn  would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner 
the company is dependent on a limited number of customers  which makes us vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers 
in  three customers accounted for of the company s sales 
the company s future prospects will depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers

pcnb matters in august  the usepa issued a stop sale  use and removal order ssuro relating to the company s usepa registered pentachloronitrobenzene pcnb product line 
the company sells pcnb primarily for use on turf with the bulk of sales occurring in september and october 
in issuing the ssuro  the usepa alleged that the company s product did not comply with the confidential statement of formula csf due to the presence of trace impurities that are not listed on the csf 
the ssuro was issued by the agency without either i a specific finding of risk  ii providing the company an opportunity to present a technical case regarding the basis for usepa s ssuro  or iii any forewarning that usepa planned to issue a ssuro 
despite its efforts  the company was unable to obtain informal resolution of the matter with the agency and  in an effort to protect its business  filed an action against usepa with the united states district court for the district of columbia in late august in which it sought emergency and permanent injunctive relief 
over the course of several months  the company worked with usepa s technical team to address purported deficiencies in the csf 
then  on august   the chief justice of that court granted the company s motion for summary judgment and vacated the ssuro on the ground that the signatory of the ssuro lacked the requisite authority to sign the order 
following the court s action  the company continued working with usepa both to revise the csf and to consolidate product labels 
on november   the usepa approved registrations for the pcnb product line for all major commercial uses including golf course  turf  certain potato uses  cotton  ornamental bulb and cole crops 
following issuance of the registrations  the company sold a limited amount of pcnb into the turf market at the tail end of the season 
the company remains in discussion with the agency on expanding the label to include certain minor uses and as to the proper labeling and disposition of some existing stocks 
given usepa s issuance of the registrations  the company cannot conclude that a loss is probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency 
on or about april   the pest management regulatory agency pmra notified the company of its intention to cancel the canadian registration for pcnb in that country  citing as a reason the company s failure to provide certain manufacturing data to the agency in a timely fashion 
the company subsequently provided the agency with the required data  and pmra extended its notice to permit continued registration through at least the end of the calendar year 
notwithstanding the company s objections  pmra permitted certain registrations of pcnb to be cancelled as of december  the company intends to seek a new registration for this product line in canada  this process could take in excess of one year to complete 
with respect to inventory in the canadian channel  the company will seek to have the goods returned and then to resell them 
the value of these goods has been recorded at the appropriate net realizable value 
b 
dbcp cases over the course of the past years  amvac and or the company have been named or otherwise implicated in a number of lawsuits concerning injuries allegedly arising from either contamination of water supplies or personal exposure to  dibromo chloropropane dbcp 
dbcp was manufactured by several chemical companies  including dow chemical company  shell oil company and amvac and was approved by the usepa to control nematodes 
dbcp was also applied on banana farms in latin america 
the usepa suspended registrations of dbcp in october  except for use on pineapples in hawaii 
the usepa suspension was partially based on studies by other manufacturers that indicated a link between male sterility and exposure to dbcp among their factory production workers producing the product 
at present  there are approximately lawsuits  foreign and domestic  filed by former banana workers in which amvac has been named as a party 
fifteen of these suits have been filed in the united states with prayers for unspecified damages and the remainder have been filed in nicaragua 
three of these domestic suits were brought by citizens of nicaragua while the other domestic suits have been brought by citizens of other countries 
these claims are all in various stages and allege injury from exposure to dbcp  including claims for sterility 
only two of the suits suazo and castillo  indicated below filed in nicaragua have been served on amvac 
it should be noted that nicaraguan plaintiffs had not been able to obtain domestic enforcement of decisions rendered by nicaraguan courts 
the eleventh circuit recently upheld a us district court s refusal to enforce a  nicaraguan judgment rendered against certain us based dbcp defendants finding  among other things  lack of international due process 
over the course of  two actions that had been filed in the los angeles county superior court named mejia and rivera involving claims for personal injury to nicaraguan banana plantation workers allegely arising from exposure to dbcp  were dismissed with prejudice by the court on its own motion with a finding of fraud on the court and blatant extortion of the defendants 
we believe that the court s findings in these cases has diminished the viability of the pending nicaraguan cases generally 
further  we 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data believe that mejia and rivera have had an effect upon other cases involving exposure to foreign residents  most notably the several cases alleging injury to residents of the ivory coast banana and pineapple plantation workers which were dismissed in by the los angeles superior court without prejudice  as plaintiffs counsel withdrew from the case and no one came forward to prosecute the action 
as described more fully below  of the cases that were still pending domestically in  in hawaii  patrickson  et 
al 
v 
dole food co  et 
al was dismissed and is on appeal  while adams involves claims that pre dated amvac s sales into the relevant market  and the state cases in louisiana continue to lie dormant 
however  during  following the dismissal of various cases in  there was a resurgence of activity by plaintiffs in i state court in california  where approximately  plaintiffs from the philippines filed an action macasa  ii in federal district court in louisiana  where an action has been filed by the hendler law firm on behalf of workers from ecuador  panama and costa rica aguilar  and iii in state court in delaware  where an individual from costa rica has brought an action blanco 
in all of the newly filed matters  some or all of the plaintiffs face challenges from applicable statutes of limitations  many of them were parties to prior lawsuits 
california matter on august   an action encaptioned macasa v 
the dole food company  inc et al  was filed with the superior court for the state of california for the county of los angeles no 
bc on behalf of  individual plaintiffs from the philippines against several defendants  including  among others  the dole food company  del monte foods  inc  shell chemical company  the dow chemical company and amvac 
plaintiffs  all of whom worked on banana plantations in the philippines  have alleged physical injury namely  sterility arising from alleged exposure to dbcp for an indeterminate period of time commencing in the s 
it has been reported that approximately three quarters of the claimants were members of a banana workers association that was a party to an action that had been brought in the philippines in about and that other plaintiffs were members as of defendants contend these plaintiffs claims are barred by the statute of limitations 
amvac answered the complaint on october  on february   plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint increasing the number of claimants to  and stating  among other things  that plaintiffs had alleged identical claims against defendants in at this very early stage of the case  no discovery has taken place  it is unknown how many of the plaintiffs may have been exposed to amvac s product  what injuries may have been sustained and whether any statutes of limitations may bar recovery 
the initial case management conference with the court took place on february  and an early step in the case is to determine the statute of limitations issue 
amvac intends to defend this matter vigorously 
at this early stage of the case  the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for this matter 
delaware matter on or about july   an action encaptioned blanco v 
amvac chemical corporation et al was filed with the superior court of the state of delaware in and for new castle county no 
nc joh on behalf of an individual plaintiff residing in costa rica against several defendants  including  among others  amvac  the dow chemical company  occidental chemical corporation  and dole food company 
in the action  plaintiff claims personal injury sterility arising from the alleged exposure to dbcp between and while working as a contract laborer in a banana plantation in costa rica 
defendant dow has filed a motion to dismiss the action as being barred under the applicable statute of limitations  as this same plaintiff filed the same action in plaintiff contends that the statute of limitations was tolled by a prior motion for class certification  which was denied 
amvac also contends that the plaintiff could not have been exposed to any amvac supplied dbcp in costa rica 
the motion to dismiss  which has been joined by all defendants  is presently scheduled for a hearing on march  amvac intends to defend the matter vigorously 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for the matter 
hawaiian matters patrickson  et

v 
dole food co  et 
al in october  amvac was served with a complaint s in which it was named as a defendant  filed in the circuit court  first circuit  state of hawaii and in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii two identical suits entitled patrickson  et 
al 
v 
dole food co  et 
al patrickson case alleging damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
other named defendants include dole food co  shell oil company  and dow 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data chemical company 
the ten named plaintiffs are variously citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and ecuador 
punitive damages are sought against each defendant 
the plaintiffs were banana workers and allege that they were exposed to dbcp in applying the product in their native countries 
the case was also filed as a class action on behalf of other workers so exposed in these four countries 
the plaintiffs allege sterility and other injuries 
after several years of law and motion activity  dow filed a motion for summary adjudication as to the remaining plaintiffs based on the statute of limitations  as they had filed suit in florida in all defendants joined in this motion 
the court granted this motion on june  plaintiffs counsel unsuccessfully argued that their claims were tolled by prior class action cases 
on november   the court denied a motion for reconsideration 
judgment in favor of the defendants was entered on july  on august   the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal  which is presently pending 
in march  dow filed a brief in opposition to the appeal  arguing that plaintiffs are barred from this action by the applicable statute of limitations 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and  accordingly  has not set up a loss contingency for this matter 
adams v 
dole food co 
et al on approximately november   amvac was served with a suit filed by two former hawaiian pineapple workers and their spouses  alleging testicular cancer due to dbcp exposure adams v 
dole food co 
et al in the first circuit for the state of hawaii 
the complaint was filed on june  and names dole food co  standard fruit and steamship company  dole fresh food  pineapple growers association  amvac  shell oil co  dow chemical co 
and occidental corporation 
plaintiff mark adams alleges he was exposed to dbcp in and while working on dole s plantation on oahu 
plaintiff nelson ng alleges he was exposed between and while working in lanai city  lanai 
amvac answered the complaint on or about december  while little discovery has taken place  amvac denies that any of its product could have been used at the times and locations alleged by these plaintiffs 
dole food co 
was dismissed on the basis of the exclusive remedy of worker s compensation benefits as it was the employer of plaintiffs 
however  plaintiffs have been granted relief to seek an interim appeal as to the dismissal of dole  which appeal is pending 
a stay has been placed on discovery other than to obtain written records 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for this matter 
louisiana matters federal on june   seven separate actions were filed by the hendler law firm in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana on behalf of individual plaintiffs banana plantation workers from ecuador  panama and costa rica against dole food company  the dow chemical company  shell oil company  and amvac chemical corporation to name a few which  for purposes of convenience here  are encaptioned aguilar et al  v

cv cjb ss 
these matters allege personal injury including sterility  cancer  skin disorders and other conditions arising from alleged exposure to dbcp within the time period from through or later 
a number of the plaintiffs appear to have been drawn from earlier dbcp litigation matters filed by the hendler law firm  including  for example  the mendez case that was dismissed from state court in hawaii see the company s form q for the period ended march  
it is unknown how many of the plaintiffs have been exposed to amvac s product  what are the actual injuries if any and whether and what statutes of limitation may apply 
amvac intends to defend these matters vigorously 
with respect to these matters  the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for these matters 
louisiana matters state in november  amvac was served with three complaints filed in the th judicial district court for the parish of st 
charles  state of louisiana  we have reported on these matters under the name of the lead case  eduardo soriano  et al 
v 
amvac  et al 
these matters allege personal injuries to about persons from ecuador  from costa rica  and from guatemala from alleged exposure to dbcp 
with the united states supreme court holding there was no federal court jurisdiction in the patrickson case  the federal court judge remanded the cases to louisiana state court in june in state court  the three cases were assigned to two different judges 
on november   the state court separated the cases handled by attorney scott hendler from the cases being pursued only against the growers handled by different counsel 
subsequently  the cases against the growers were settled and all those actions were dismissed 
the cases handled by mr 
hendler were supposed to be placed in a new action  which was not done 
after a hearing on january   the court ruled on february  that these plaintiffs could still proceed in the existing cases rather than in a new pleading 
in mid june  some years after filing the actions  plaintiffs have propounded written discovery 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data against defendants 
no other discovery has been made  hence  it is unknown how many if any of the plaintiffs have been exposed to amvac s product  what are the actual injuries if any and whether and what statutes of limitation may apply 
amvac intends to defend these matters vigorously 
with respect to these matters  the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for this matter 
nicaraguan matters in may  two suits filed in nicaragua in were received that name amvac  the dow chemical company  dole food co  dole fresh fruit  and standard fruit company 
the two suits for personal injuries for sterility and reduced sperm counts have been filed on behalf of a total of banana workers flavio apolinar castillo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
and luis cristobal martinez suazo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
in december  amvac received six additional  similar  lawsuits filed on behalf of a total of plaintiffs 
on january   amvac was served with the suazo and castillo suits  and in march  counsel in nicaragua filed objections to jurisdiction over amvac in these two cases 
the court finally ruled on all the defendants objections on march   by denying each objection to jurisdiction  this ruling has been appealed 
a review of court filings in chinandega  nicaragua  by local counsel has found suits filed pursuant to public law that name amvac and include approximately  plaintiffs 
however  only two cases  castillo and suazo  have been served on amvac 
all but one of the suits in nicaragua have been filed pursuant to special law  an october nicaraguan statute that contains substantive and procedural provisions that nicaragua s attorney general previously expressed as unconstitutional 
each of the nicaraguan plaintiffs claims  in compensatory damages and  in punitive damages 
in all of these cases  amvac is a joint defendant with dow chemical and dole food company  inc amvac contends that the nicaragua courts do not have jurisdiction over it and that public law violates international due process of law 
amvac intends to contest personal jurisdiction and demand under law that the claims be litigated in the united states 
thus far  it appears that the nicaraguan courts have denied all requests of other defendants under law that allow the defendants the option of consenting to jurisdiction in the united states 
it is not presently known as to how many of these plaintiffs actually claim exposure to dbcp at the time amvac s product was allegedly used nor is there any verification of the claimed injuries 
based on the precedent of the earlier suits in nicaragua  it would appear likely that the nicaragua courts will  over the defendants objections  enter multi million dollar judgments for the plaintiffs and against all defendants in these cases 
however  to date  plaintiffs have not had success in enforcing nicaraguan judgments against domestic companies before us courts 
one such judgment not including the company was entered in august for  for plaintiffs against dole food and other entities 
it has also been reported that on december   the nicaraguan court rendered a judgment for  against dow chemical company  shell occidental  and standard fruit company for some  plaintiffs 
an enforcement action entitled osorio against dole and dow for the  judgment was filed in the us district court in miami  florida 
in this enforcement action  on october   the federal court issued a lengthy decision refusing to enforce the judgment on the grounds that law violated due process of law and that the nicaraguan courts were not impartial tribunals 
the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the eleventh circuit court of appeal on march  on march   the united states court of appeals for the th circuit upheld the lower court s decision to refuse to enforce the nicaraguan judgment under the florida recognition act  finding  among other things  the fact that judgment had been rendered under a system in nicaragua that does not provide procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law and was contrary to public policy 
the th circuit court did not address whether the nicaraguan courts do not provide impartial tribunals as the district court had found 
c 
other matters brazilian citation 
on or about october   ibama the brazilian equivalent of the usepa served amvac b with a notice of violation alleging that two lots of granutox formulated product having phorate as the active ingredient stored at basf sa amvac s exclusive distributor in brazil and fmc quimica do brasil ltda 
which formulates end use product in that country were not in compliance with the end use registration on file with ibama 
specifically  ibama alleged that the color of the lots gray was inconsistent with the description in ibama s files pink 
ibama also indicated an intention to assess a fine of approximately against amvac b 
the company has challenged the citation  among other reasons  on the ground that the change in color has to do with the removal of a coloring component and that such removal poses no environmental or toxicity risk 
in 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data march  ibama denied amvac b s first appeal 
the company believes  however  that the agency is statutorily prevented from levying a fine of this magnitude for an infraction of this nature 
thus  the company has filed another appeal on these grounds and expects to hear a response within six months 
at this stage  the company believes that a loss of between and is probable and has set up a loss contingency in the amount of philip adame v 
state of california et al 
on or about november   plaintiffs approximately residents living proximally to a acre parcel in santa clara county  california  that had been operated by the university of california from to as a fungicide and herbicide testing facility known as the bay area research extension center barec designated amvac and other companies as defendants in an amendment to second amended complaint entitled philip adame v 
state of california  superior court of california  county of santa clara  case no 
cv in which plaintiffs allege property damage and physical injuries arising from the operation of barec 
the second amended complaint in this matter had been filed in october and had included defendants the regents of the university of california and velsicol chemical corporation  both of whom have since been dismissed from the action with prejudice following settlement with plaintiffs 
at this stage  amvac has not been served with any pleadings 
however  those defendants who have been served with the second amended complaint have filed both a motion to quash and a motion to dismiss on the ground that plaintiffs failed to serve any of the newly named defendants with the pleading in which they were designated as defendants and  at any rate  failed to designate any of them as defendants within three years of the filing of the complaint 
amvac believes that the case has no merit and  if served  will defend the matter vigorously

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data results of operations compared with change net sales insecticides herbicides other total crop non crop gross profit crop non crop overall financial performance including net sales and net income for the year ended december  improved as compared to the same period in our net sales for the period are up approximately to  compared to  for the year ended december  net sales of our crop business in were  which constitutes an increase of about over the net sales of  in net sales of non crop products for the period were  which constitutes an increase of about over the net sales of  in the same period last year 
a more detailed discussion of product groups and products having a material effect on net sales for each of the crop and non crop segments appears below 
agricultural market conditions were generally better than those of strong global demand for food  animal feed  natural fiber and bio fuel feed stocks spurred higher than normal crop prices 
in light of these market conditions  growers invested more heavily in yield enhancing inputs which fueled demand for many of the company s most important crop protection products 
rising crop commodity prices also led to an increase in acreage planted for many crops in the united states  particularly corn and cotton  which are important to our business 
in  a near record  acres of corn were planted and cotton acreage expanded to  acres from  acres one year ago and just  acres two years ago 
in addition  the practice of planting corn on the same acres year after year referred to as corn on corn as opposed to rotating crops gave rise to greater primary secondary insect pest pressure in the mid west united states 
further  years of continuous application of glyphosate herbicides has led to resistant weeds grasses and increased the need for complementary auxiliary herbicide use 
also  the wide spread use of genetically modified seeds plants in us corn during the last decade has engendered resistance among some soil insects that had been controlled by genetic plant defenses 
the cumulative effect of all these factors led to increased demand for the type of crop protection products for corn that the company supplies 
further  the company s sales benefited from the acquisition of several new products acquired in the second half of the addition of the insecticides aztec  mocap and nemacur accounted for approximately half of the company s  year over year gain in crop sales 
we also benefitted from the withdrawal of a competitive insecticide product in the us market  which yielded improved sales of our granular insecticide thimet 
with respect to our crop segment  net sales of our insecticides in were up strongly by approximately to  as compared to  for the comparable period in within this segment  annual net sales of our granular soil insecticides were up approximately over the same period  driven by a strong performance from our primary corn soil insecticides aztec  smartchoice  counter and force 
this product group also benefitted from the newly acquired mocap and nemacur granular insecticides nematicides which were purchased in december despite the fact that we experienced a shortfall in supply of mocap during from our source 
annual net sales of thimet grew by more than one half over the prior year due to increased peanut acres  increased use for nematode control in sugar cane and the above mentioned substitution for a withdrawn competitive insecticide aldicarb 
among our non granular insecticide products  overall net sales declined by nearly 
our foliar cotton insecticide bidrin decreased compared to the prior year due to severe drought conditions in the southern region 
further  sales of 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data bifenthrin  permethrin and orthene declined approximately as we continued to de emphasize the applications of these products that have become susceptible to low priced generic competition  however  despite the drop in net sales  we experienced improved overall levels of gross profit from these three products 
offsetting these declines  sales of our dibrom insecticide  which has historically been used primarily for mosquito control  continued to expand in crop citrus applications 
within the product group of herbicides fungicides fumigants  net sales in were up about over the year  v 

within this group we had mixed results 
net sales of our herbicide products were up  led by our post emergent corn herbicide  impact  which mid west farmers use as a highly effective product to combat the increasing challenge of glyphosate tolerant weeds 
our fumigants sales were up modestly as our vapam and k pam products continue to be us market leaders in this product category 
net sales of our fungicides  however  were down during as compared to  this was due to the fact that all domestic sales of pcnb were suspended following the issuance of a ssuro in august  partially offset by the issuance of new labels in november within the segment of other products which includes plant growth regulators  molluscicides and tolling activity  we experienced a nearly increase in net sales during as compared to  v 

this increase is primarily due to strong sales of folex  a defoliant used in cotton harvest management  while certain cotton regions experienced severe drought conditions  in other areas  cooler than normal conditions caused the growers to use the product at higher use rates 
net sales of folex were also positively impacted by our acquisition of the domestic def tribufos product line in late july partially offsetting folex s gains was a slight drop in net sales of naa  a plant growth regulator primarily used in apples to stop apple drop  the return of bloom  and thinning blossom 
net sales of metaldehyde a molluscicide were approximately flat over the comparable period  and tolling revenues decreased by approximately  in as compared to finally  it should be noted that  included in sales in was data compensation in the amount of there was no similar revenue recorded in within our non crop segment  net sales were up by about  v 
 compared to on the positive side  naled sales our dibrom brand mosquito adulticide were up despite limited hurricane activity and persistent drought conditions in the southwest  early season river flooding caused greater pest pressure and spraying activity 
in the same segment  net sales of pest strips increased over the prior year as professional pest control operators continue to recognize that our active ingredient  ddvp  is one of the most effective general pest control agents available today 
offsetting these gains was a decline in net sales of our pcnb fungicide for turf uses 
as mentioned above  all domestic sales had been suspended through late november  when usepa issued new labels 
consequently  the company missed most of the turf season 
in addition  the company has yet to re enter the canadian market following the expiration of its registration at the end of gross margin for the year ended december  was up to from for the comparable period 
this improvement was in part due to the result of improved manufacturing activity  the efficiencies of manufacturing higher volumes of thimet and counter to meet demand and the commencement of manufacturing of folex at our axis facility 
in addition  greater sales of higher margin products contributed to this improvement and  to a lesser extent  higher pricing of generic product lines 
operating expenses in increased by  to  or of sales as compared to  or in the differences in operating expenses by department are as follows change selling general and administrative research  product development and regulatory freight  delivery and warehousing selling expenses increased by  to end at  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of the main driver for increased overall cost was from expenses in support of our proprietary delivery system and other stewardship activities  wages  and travel expenses to support our expanded business 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data general and administrative expenses increased by  to end at  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the four main drivers of this increase were an increase in amortization expense that resulted from the acquisitions made in december  an increase in stock based compensation expense relating to grants issued in december  and an increase in incentive compensation expense from the increase in overall financial performance 
offsetting these increases  the company re assessed the fair value of certain discounted deferred liabilities related to product line acquisition 
research  product development costs and regulatory expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of this is mainly due to increased studies on our new and existing products including spending related to the pcnb ssuro

during the year we paid down to zero the revolving line and did not draw further funds as a result of continued focus on inventory  receivables and program management 
as can be seen from the table above  our effective interest rate was for the twelve months ended december  this is effectively flat in comparison to the prior year

in the prior year approximately of program liabilities were paid in the three months ended december  income tax expense for amounted to  as compared to  for the effective tax rate is at  as compared to an effective rate of for the increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower tax benefits from federal and california r d due to substantially higher pre tax book income in as compared to  lower than expected domestic production activities deduction claimed in the federal income tax return  and the benefit related to stock options in net income ended at  or

with respect to our crop products  over the course of  market conditions were  for the most part  better than those of we entered with fairly lean inventory levels in the distribution channels  due to the rigorous procurement practices of further  over the first half of  we were able to sell most of our seasonal products into the channel effectively  and favorable midwest weather conditions enabled us to sell product into both first and second quarters of while third quarter sales of our corn related products declined over historical levels as customers deferred their procurement activity for to take place closer to the growing season  we did see a resurgence in fourth quarter sales of those products 
further  in light of increased acres for both cotton and peanut crops year over year  we recorded strong sales of certain products for use with those crops over the course of the entire year 
we experienced a drop in sales of our fungicide product line over  due to the ssuro issued by usepa with respect to our domestic pentachloronitrobenzene product line  which  as noted below  caused us to miss the domestic turf season entirely 
a more detailed discussion of sales performance by our crop and non crop segments  further broken down by product group and product line  follows 
with respect to our crop segment  net sales of our insecticides in were up strongly by approximately to  as compared to  for the comparable period in within this segment  net sales of our granular soil insecticides were up approximately  largely due to increased net sales of counter in the first half of the year and fourth quarter  counter has experienced a resurgence in use on corn for nematode control and is proving to be efficacious for sugar beets where seed treatments are unable to control heavy pest pressure 
in addition  thimet sales increased year over year due to both increased peanut acres in the southeast and increased use for nematode control sugar cane 
net sales of our cotton insecticides increased by about over the prior year  this trend has resulted from an increase in cotton acres planted coupled with strong cotton prices 
within the product group of herbicides fungicides fumigants  net sales in were up approximately over the year  v 

within this group  however  we had mixed results 
net sales of our herbicide products were up by approximately  led by our post emergent corn herbicide  impact  due to both favorable weather conditions and a well executed plan of distribution  we saw strong sales in the first two quarters  then a lag in the third quarter as customers deferred procurement until closer to planting time and a resurgence in the fourth quarter  as growers anticipate the season 
our fumigants enjoyed mild gains in net sales year over year up by about  in fact  fourth quarter sales in  on an historical basis  were comparatively low  as adverse weather cut short the application season for this just in time product 
with better weather conditions  fumigant sales in have trended toward more historical norms 
net sales of our fungicides  however  were down sharply approximately during as compared to  due largely to pcnb on crop uses  which experienced a decrease in net sales in the first half of the year arising from formulation issues  and in the second half of the year from the ssuro issued by usepa for domestic product 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data within the segment of other products which includes plant growth regulators  molluscicides and tolling activity  we experienced a nearly increase in net sales during as compared to  v 

this increase is primarily due to strong sales of folex  a compound used for cotton harvest management  not only did we benefit from increased cotton acres  but also from the fact that we completed the acquisition of the domestic def tribufos product line in late july partially offsetting folex s gains was a drop in net sales of naa  a plant growth regulator used primarily for thinning apple blossoms  an early frost in late obviated the need for this product in  as growers still had inventory from the prior year for use in the season 
in addition  net sales of dacthal were up slightly year over year  while we have benefited from the lessening of water restrictions in the western states  we have experienced curtailment of uses in europe 
further  net sales of metaldehyde a molluscicide were up about over the comparable period  this increase arose primarily from rainy conditions in the eastern and northern midwestern states and the attendant increase in slug and snail pressure 
tolling revenues decreased by approximately  in as compared to  as a result of one order which occurred in and not in it should be noted that  included in sales were data compensation amounts of in and  in within our non crop segment  net sales were down by about  v 
 compared to this decline was due mostly to lost sales of pcnb on turf uses  the ssuro was issued in august  just before normal sales into that market 
on the positive side  naled sales our mosquito adulticide were up by about  despite persistent dry conditions in the south west 
net sales of pest strips more than tripled over the prior year  in light of the market s recognition that the active ingredient  ddvp  is one of the only compounds effective against bedbugs 
these gains  however  were offset in part by reduced sales of orthene  which due to heavy pricing pressure from generic competitors  continues to carry lower margins and less emphasis in our sales plans 
our cost of sales for was  or of net sales 
this compared to  or of net sales for the decline in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in arose primarily from three factors  first  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a one time non cash charge in the amount of  relating to adjusting inventory values to net realizable value impacting our crop segment cost of sales by  and our non crop segment cost of sales by 
there was no such charge in second  plant capacity utilization improved in as compared to  underutilization costs declined from approximately  in to  in third  the mix of products sold in included a greater emphasis on higher margin sku s  a reduction in sales of products that are subject to pricing pressure from generic competition eg  orthene and bifenthrin  and a drop in tolling activity for third parties  which also carries lower margins 
gross profit ended at  or of net sales in as compared to  or of net sales in this increase is due to the non cash charge taken in the fourth quarter of and the other factors described in the immediately preceding paragraph

foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in us dollars 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future 
should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the company sells exports its products  management is not certain such fluctuations will or will not materially impact the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data critical accounting policies certain of the company s policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices and other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from sales is recognized at the time title and the risks of ownership pass 
this is when the customer has made the fixed commitment to purchase the goods  the products are shipped per the customer s instructions  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company has in place procedures to ensure that revenue is recognized when earned 
the procedures are subject to management s review and from time to time certain sales are excluded until it is clear that the title has passed and there is no further recourse to the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusted for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss

each quarter management compares each sale transaction with published programs to determine what program liability has been incurred 
once this initial calculation is made for the specific quarter  sales and marketing management along with executive and financial management review the accumulated program balance and make assessments of whether or not customers are tracking in a manner that indicates that they will meet the requirements set out in the terms and conditions attached to each program 
if management believes that customers are falling short of their annual goals then periodic adjustments will be made to the accumulated accrual to properly reflect the company s best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date 
the majority of adjustments are made at the end of the crop season at which time customer performance can be fully assessed 
programs are paid out predominantly on an annual basis  usually in the final quarter of the financial year or the first quarter of the following year 
long lived asset the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
management considers the carrying value of long lived assets to be reasonable 
generally  the fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows

the company adopted the provisions of fasb asc under the provisions of fasb asc  identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are not amortized 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset to the company is based upon a number of factors including the effects of demand  competition  and expected changes in the marketability of the company s products 
the company re evaluates whether these intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss  if any  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset s being tested for impairment as well as selecting a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company  in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the company has performed an impairment review for the year ending december and there were no impairment losses recorded 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash  receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the fair value of the company s long term debt and note payable to bank is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the company for debt of the same remaining maturities 
such fair value approximates the respective carrying values of the company s long term debt and note payable to bank 
the company s cash flow hedge related to a variable debt instrument and outstanding foreign currency derivatives used to hedge foreign currency balances are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  and the balances as of december  and which are included in other assets  net and accrued and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows fair value measurements using input type level level level as of december  liability foreign currency derivative financial instrument interest rate derivative financial instruments as of december  liability interest rate derivative financial instruments includes accrued interest expense the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the derivative financial instruments above in which the counterparties have high credit ratings  were derived from pricing models  such as discounted cash flow techniques  with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data 
the company s discounted cash flow techniques use observable market inputs  such as libor based yield curves and foreign currency forward rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  primarily from its borrowing activities 
the company s indebtedness to its primary lender is evidenced by a line of credit with a variable rate of interest  which fluctuates with changes in the lender s reference rate 
the company uses derivative financial instruments for trading purposes to protect trading performance from exchange rate fluctuations on material contracts  also  as a condition of the company s new credit agreement with its banks  the company is required to maintain in effect interest rate swap agreement s for a notional amount not less than one half of the principal amount of its term loan originally the term loan was  at any given time 
the company conducts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico  central and south america 
therefore changes in the value of the currencies of such countries or regions affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exchange exposure through natural hedges based on the operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change in the value of all foreign currencies would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
