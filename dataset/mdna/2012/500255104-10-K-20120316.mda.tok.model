com beginning august the success of our recently launched brands  as well as the growth of our other exclusive and private brands  continue to drive increased penetration of our exclusive and private brand sales as a percentage of total sales 
this penetration increased approximately basis points to for in store shopping experience practical  easy shopping is about convenience 
at kohl s  convenience includes a neighborhood location close to home  convenient parking  easily accessible entry  knowledgeable and friendly associates  wide aisles  a functional store layout  shopping carts strollers and fast  centralized checkouts 
though our stores have fewer departments than traditional  full line department stores  the physical layout of the store and our focus on strong in stock positions in style  color and size is aimed at providing a convenient shopping experience for an increasingly time starved customer 
at the time of our initial public offering in  we had stores in the midwest 
as of year end  we operated  stores 
we have stores in states and in every large and intermediate sized market in the united states 
increase number of stores gross square footage in millions retail selling square footage in millions though our expansion rate has slowed in recent years  our new store program continues to target profitable growth opportunities 
we expect to increase our store count by approximately stores in fiscal  substantially all of the stores will be small stores  to  square feet 
we plan to continue to focus our future expansion efforts on opportunistic acquisitions as well as fill in stores in our better performing markets 
remodels are also an important part of our in store shopping experience initiatives as we believe it is extremely important to maintain our existing store base 
we completed store remodels in  in and in we currently plan to remodel approximately stores in we have effectively compressed the remodel duration period which minimizes costs and disruption to our stores and benefits our sales and customer experience 
we expect a typical remodel in will take seven weeks  a reduction of approximately percent since we remain focused on providing the solid infrastructure needed to ensure consistent  low cost execution 
we proactively invest in distribution capacity and regional management to facilitate growth in new and existing markets as well as online 
our central merchandising organization tailors merchandise assortments to reflect regional climates and preferences 
management information systems support our low cost culture by enhancing productivity and providing the information needed to make key merchandising decisions 
we believe the transferability of the kohl s retailing strategy  our experience in acquiring and converting pre existing stores and in building new stores  and our substantial investment in management information systems  centralized distribution and headquarters functions provide a solid foundation for our existing operations and further expansion 
distribution we receive substantially all of our merchandise at our nine retail distribution centers 
a small amount of our merchandise is delivered directly to the stores by vendors or their distributors 
the retail distribution centers  which are strategically located through the united sates  ship merchandise to each store by contract carrier several times a week 
we also operate fulfillment centers in monroe  ohio  san bernardino  california  and edgewood  maryland that service our e commerce business 
we expect to open a fourth e commerce fulfillment center in texas in the summer of see item  properties  for additional information about our distribution centers 
employees as of january   we employed approximately  associates  including approximately  full time and  part time associates 
the number of associates varies during the year  peaking during the back to school and holiday seasons 
none of our associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit 
we believe our relations with our associates are very good 
competition the retail industry is highly competitive 
management considers style  quality and price to be the most significant competitive factors in the industry 
merchandise mix  service and convenience are also key competitive factors 
our primary competitors are traditional department stores  upscale mass merchandisers and specialty stores 
our specific competitors vary from market to market 
merchandise vendors we purchase merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers 
we have terms of engagement requirements which set forth the basic minimum requirements all business partners must meet in order to do business with kohl s 
our terms of engagement include provisions regarding laws and regulations  employment practices  ethical standards  environmental and legal requirements  communication  monitoring compliance  record keeping  subcontracting and corrective action 
our expectation is that all business partners will comply with these terms of engagement and quickly remediate any deficiencies  if noted  in order to maintain our business relationship 
approximately of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third party purchasing agent 
none of our vendors individually accounted for more than of our net purchases during we have no significant long term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers  and believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier 
we believe we have good working relationships with our suppliers 
seasonality our business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences 
the majority of our sales and income are typically realized during the second half of each fiscal year 
the back to school season extends from august through september and represents approximately of our annual sales 
approximately of our sales occur during the holiday season in the months of november and december 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the fiscal year 
in addition  quarterly results of operations depend upon the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores 
trademarks and service marks the name kohl s is a registered service mark of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries

in addition  statements covering our future sales or financial performance and our plans  performance and other objectives  expectations or intentions are forward looking statements  such as statements regarding our liquidity  debt service requirements  planned capital expenditures  future store openings and adequacy of capital resources and reserves 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements  including among others  those risk factors described below 
forward looking statements relate to the date made  and we undertake no obligations to update them 
declines in general economic conditions  consumer spending levels and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and cause reductions in our sales and or gross margin 
consumer spending habits  including spending for the merchandise that we sell  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  prevailing interest rates  housing costs  energy costs  income tax rates and policies  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
in addition  consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income  credit availability and debt levels 
recent economic conditions have caused disruptions and significant volatility in financial markets  increased rates of default and bankruptcy and declining consumer and business confidence  which has led to decreased levels of consumer spending  particularly on discretionary items 
a continued or incremental slowdown in the us economy and the uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
as all of our stores are located in the united states  we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the us economy 
consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation 
the outbreak or escalation of war  or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states  could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers 
actions by our competitors could adversely affect our operating results 
the retail business is highly competitive 
we compete for customers  associates  locations  merchandise  services and other important aspects of our business with many other local  regional and national retailers 
those competitors  some of which have a greater market presence than kohl s  include traditional store based retailers  internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce 
unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors may adversely affect our performance 
product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety  we could experience lost sales  experience increased costs and or be exposed to legal and reputational risk 
events that give rise to actual  potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and or private litigation 
reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns  could have a negative impact on our sales 
if we do not offer merchandise our customers want and fail to successfully manage our inventory levels  our sales and or gross margin may be adversely impacted 
our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise 
failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes  preferences  spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long term relationships with our customers 
additionally  failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory  which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results 
ineffective marketing could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
we believe that differentiating kohl s in the marketplace is critical to our success 
we design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brands  which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty  increase the number of customers that shop our stores and increase our sales 
if our marketing programs are not successful  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to raise additional capital  if needed  or to raise capital on favorable terms 
if our existing cash  cash generated from operations and other sources  and funds available on our lines of credit are insufficient to fund our future activities  including capital expenditures  or repay debt when it becomes due  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing  we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis if at all 
failure to obtain capital on acceptable terms  or at all  when required by our business circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us including an inability to fund new growth and other capital expenditures 
inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and or shareholder value 
our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long term returns 
this includes spending on inventory  capital projects and expenses  managing debt levels  and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 
to a large degree  capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks 
the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency 
if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns  we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value 
changes in our credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and or profitability 
our credit card operations facilitate sales in our stores and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit 
the proprietary kohl s credit card accounts have been sold to an unrelated third party  but we share in the net risk adjusted revenue of the portfolio  which is defined as the sum of finance charges  late fees and other revenue less write offs of uncollectible accounts 
changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations will be shared similar to the revenue if interest rates exceed defined amounts 
though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue  increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program 
changes in credit card use  payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic  legal  social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty 
changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results 
growth in our e commerce business could adversely affect some of our operating metrics 
in recent years  we have experienced significant growth in our e commerce business 
some of this growth has resulted in lower sales in our stores 
though this has no impact on our consolidated sales  it has had a negative affect on our net income as a percentage of sales as our stores are currently more profitable than our e commerce business 
this profitability variance is due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  a higher mix of lower margin merchandise in our e commerce business  shipping costs  and investments to provide the infrastructure necessary to grow the e commerce business 
though we are aggressively working to improve the profitability of our e commerce business  there can be no assurances that our e commerce business will become as profitable as our stores 
weather conditions could adversely affect our sales and or profitability by affecting consumer shopping patterns 
because a significant portion of our business is apparel and subject to weather conditions in our markets  our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions 
frequent or unusually heavy snow  ice or rain storms  natural disasters such as earthquakes  tornadoes  floods and hurricanes  or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns  diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise and or causing physical damage to our properties 
our business is seasonal  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year  which includes the back to school and holiday seasons 
this seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost effective manner  which could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
approximately of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third party purchasing agent 
the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors 
all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws and our required terms of engagement 
our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult with respect to goods sourced outside the united states 
political or financial instability  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade  and the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance 
if any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy  receivership or similar proceedings  we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts  transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms  which could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
increases in the price of merchandise  raw materials  fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results 
we could again experience inflation in our merchandise  raw materials  fuel and labor costs as we did during the cost of cotton  which is a key raw material in many of our products  had the most dramatic increase in the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially  depending on a variety of factors  including demand  acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields  weather  supply conditions  transportation costs  energy prices  work stoppages  government regulation and government policy  economic climates  market speculation and other unpredictable factors 
fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel  labor and raw materials  such as cotton  could again affect our cost of goods and an inability to mitigate these cost increases  unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions  might cause a decrease in our profitability  while any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume 
additionally  any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner 
both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise  raw materials  fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers 
an inability to attract and retain quality employees could result in higher payroll costs and adversely affect our operating results 
our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of quality associates 
many of those associates are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels  prevailing wage rates  minimum wage legislation and changing demographics 
changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance 
an inability to open new stores could adversely affect our financial performance 
our ability to open additional new stores will depend  in part  upon the availability of existing retail stores or store sites on acceptable terms 
increases in real estate  construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and affect our return on investment 
there can be no assurance that such stores or sites will be available for purchase or lease  or that they will be available on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to grow our retail business  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 
various aspects of our operations are subject to federal  state or local laws  rules and regulations  any of which may change from time to time 
such laws  rules and regulations include  among other areas  general credit regulations which could impact our credit card operations  health care reform which could cause us to incur additional health care and other costs  environmental legislation which could cause us to incur additional remediation and or maintenance costs  and labor and employment laws which could impact our hiring and employment practices 
the costs and other effects of other new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty 
for example  new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials 
we continually monitor the state and federal employment environment for developments that may impact us 
failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation  disruption of business and or loss of employee morale 
additionally  we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 
damage to the reputation of the kohl s brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect our sales 
we believe the kohl s brand name and many of our private and exclusive brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them 
we develop and promote private and exclusive brands that have generated national recognition 
in some cases  the brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well known individuals 
damage to the reputations whether or not justified of our brand names or any affiliated individuals  could arise from product failures  litigation or various forms of adverse publicity  especially in social media outlets  and may generate negative customer sentiment  potentially resulting in a reduction in sales  earnings  and shareholder value 
disruptions in our information systems could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems 
in particular  we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales  distribution  merchandise planning and allocation functions 
we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls 
com website 
the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm sales and profitability 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation  expose us to risks of litigation and liability  disrupt our operations and harm our business 
as part of our normal course of business  we collect  process and retain sensitive and confidential customer  employee and company information 
the protection of this data is extremely important to us  our employees and our customers 
despite the considerable security measures we have in place  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors  or other similar events 
any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  whether by us or our vendors  could disrupt our operations  damage our reputation and customers willingness to shop in our stores or on our website  violate applicable laws  regulations  orders and agreements  and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material

the northeast region and the accessories and home businesses reported the strongest comparable store sales growth 
gross margin was essentially flat to at of sales for we successfully managed apparel cost inflation throughout the year  but saw lower margins during the fourth quarter holiday season due to the extremely competitive landscape and sales which were below our expectations

we ended the year with  stores in states  including which were successfully opened in we also completed remodels in as of year end  approximately one half of our stores were either new or remodeled in the last five years 
we believe this is a critical element in creating a positive shopping experience and driving increased sales 
outlook during  we experienced increases in apparel costs and were aggressive in passing these higher costs to our customers 
in  we expect to see modest cost increases in the first six months of the year  but to see decreases in the last six months of the year 
we currently plan to be less aggressive about passing higher costs on to our customer in we expect this change to have a positive impact on our sales  but a negative impact on our gross margin rate

as a result of these price increases there was some resistance from our customers in both units per transaction and number of transactions per store 
the northeast region reported the strongest sales growth with comparable store sales increases in the low single digits 
all other regions reported comparable store sales decreases of one to three percent for the year 
e commerce revenue  which includes shipping and other revenues  reached billion in this represents a million increase over e commerce revenue of million

dollars in millions selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include compensation and benefit costs including stores  headquarters  buying and merchandising and distribution centers  occupancy and operating costs of our retail  distribution and corporate facilities  freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities  advertising expenses  offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs  net revenues from our kohl s credit card operations  and other administrative costs 
sg a also includes the costs incurred prior to new store openings  such as advertising  hiring and training costs for new employees  processing and transporting initial merchandise  and rent expense 
we do not include depreciation and amortization in sg a 
the classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry 
sg a for increased million  or  over  but decreased as a percentage of net sales  or leveraged 
sg a increased primarily due to store growth  increased advertising  and investments in technology and infrastructure related to our e commerce business 
hourly store payroll costs leveraged in and continues to be driven by sustainable productivity improvements  such as the continued rollout of electronic signs 
as of year end  stores were equipped with electronic signs 
advertising increased as a percentage of net sales  or deleveraged  in  primarily due to increased spending during a very promotional holiday season and incremental spending to support the jennifer lopez and marc anthony brand launches 
distribution costs  which are included in sg a  totaled million for  million for and million for the increase in is primarily due to growth in our e commerce business 
on april   we commenced a seven year private label credit card program agreement with capital one  national association capital one 
pursuant to this agreement  capital one offers private label credit cards to new and existing customers of kohl s 
we handle all customer service functions  including processing billings  collecting on accounts  responding to customer inquiries  and maintaining data systems 
we are also responsible for all advertising and marketing related to our credit card customers 
kohl s and capital one share in the net risk adjusted revenue of the portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges  late fees and other revenue less write offs of uncollectible accounts 
unlike the previous program agreement  we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables if interest rates were to exceed defined rates 
while we currently believe that increases in funding costs would be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue  the profitability of our credit card program may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
revenues from our credit card operations  net of the expenses to provide the functions detailed above  were million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to represents higher revenues as a result of higher finance charges due to receivable growth  higher late fees due to regulatory changes which reduced late fees in  and lower receivable write offs due to improved delinquency rates 
a more favorable revenue sharing percentage under the current capital one agreement also contributed to the increase 
the decrease in compared to reflects lower late fees due to regulatory changes and higher receivable write offs due to higher delinquency rates  partially offset by higher finance charges due to receivable growth 
sg a for increased million  or  over  but decreased as a percentage of net sales 
sg a increased primarily due to store growth  higher sales  and investments in technology and infrastructure related to our e commerce business 
depreciation and amortization 
in millions depreciation and amortization the increases in depreciation and amortization are primarily due to the addition of new stores  remodels and the opening of our third e commerce fulfillment center in edgewood  maryland 
operating income 
dollars in millions operating income as a percent of net sales the changes in operating income and operating income as a percent of net sales are due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense 
in millions interest expense  net net interest expense for decreased million  or  from the decrease is attributable to the repayment of debt totaling million in march and october and the subsequent issuance of million of debt in october at a lower interest rate 
net interest expense for increased million over the increase was primarily attributed to interest on new financing obligations related to new stores 
income taxes 
dollars in millions provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate for was comparable to the and tax rates 
inflation although we expect that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions  including rising food  fuel and energy prices  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by such factors in the future 
we experienced increases in apparel costs in we expect to see modest increases in the first six months of  but to see decreases in the last six months of the year 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with our expansion and remodeling programs and seasonal and new store inventory purchases 
share repurchases and dividend payments to shareholders are currently another significant usage of cash 
these payments are discretionary and can be discontinued at any time should we require cash for other uses 
our primary sources of funds are cash flow provided by operations  short term trade credit and our lines of credit 
short term trade credit  in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases  often represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories 
seasonal cash needs may be met by cash on hand and or the line of credit available under our revolving credit facility 
our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall  peaking during the november and december holiday selling season 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of billion 
we generated billion of free cash flow in see the free cash flow discussion later in this liquidity and capital resources section for additional discussion of this non gaap financial measure 
dollars in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
cash provided by operations increased in to billion 
total merchandise inventories at january  were million  or  higher than year end on a per store basis  merchandise inventories at january  increased in dollars over year end  but decreased in units 
the decrease in units per store reflects our various inventory management initiatives  including our conservative sales and receipt planning and lower clearance levels 
the increase in dollars per store reflects higher merchandise costs over accounts payable at january  increased million over year end the increase is primarily due to expiration of vendor financing initiatives 
timing of inventory purchases also contributed to the change 
accounts payable as a percent of inventory was at january   compared to at year end the increase is primarily due to higher accounts payable balances with some vendors over year end  due to timing of when these vendors required payment 
cash provided by operations decreased million from billion in to billion in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in cash flows from accounts payable activities 
accounts payable at january  decreased million from year end accounts payable as a percent of inventory was at january   compared to at year end the change is primarily due to vendor finance initiatives which were fully implemented at year end in prior years  we rolled out a receivable financing program whereby a financial institution provides our vendors with financing  at a rate which is below what the vendors could normally obtain on their own 
we offer this program to vendors in exchange for extended payment terms 
we do not incur any costs or expenses or forfeit any portion of our receivables in connection with this program 
timing of inventory purchases also contributed to the change 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million to million in  primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures totaled million for  a million increase over this increase is primarily due to higher capital spending for new stores  remodels  our third e commerce fulfillment center and a call center in texas 
capital expenditures by major category were as follows estimate new stores remodels relocations distribution centers computer hardware and software fixtures and store improvements other total we expect total capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal the decrease from is primarily due to a decrease in new store openings approximately expected in compared to in and a decrease in store remodels approximately expected in compared to in 
we expect to incur capital expenditures for construction of a fourth fulfillment center to support our e commerce business in fiscal the spending on this project should be consistent with what was incurred in fiscal for the construction of our third fulfillment center 
the actual amount of our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number and timing of new stores  distribution centers and e commerce fulfillment centers opened  the mix of owned  leased or acquired stores  and the number of stores remodeled 
we do not anticipate that our expansion plans will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements 
sales of long term investments generated cash of million in and million in as of january   we had investments in auction rate securities ars with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million 
since  the market for ars has diminished 
this has limited our ability to liquidate these investments  but we do not believe that it will have a significant impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
to date  we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
substantially all redemptions to date were made at par 
net cash used in investing activities increased million to million in  primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures totaled million for  a million increase over this increase is primarily due to higher capital spending as a result of increased remodels  the opening of our second e commerce fulfillment center and planned incremental it investments to support our e commerce business 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in capital spending for new stores 
financing activities 
our financing activities used cash of billion in and million in the increase is primarily due to increased treasury stock purchases in we repurchased million shares of our common stock for approximately billion in the shares were purchased as part of our billion share repurchase program 
pursuant to this program  we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions  accelerated stock repurchase programs  tender offers  privately negotiated transactions or by other means 
subject to market conditions  we expect to complete the program by the end of fiscal we repaid long term debt of million in march and million in october in october  we issued million of notes with semi annual interest payments beginning may the notes mature on november  and have an effective interest rate of 
in conjunction with the debt issuance  we paid million to settle interest rate hedges which were entered into in december and may in anticipation of the october debt issuance 
we have various facilities upon which we may draw funds  including a year  billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility which we entered into in june the co leads of this facility  bank of america  us bank  and wells fargo bank  have each committed million 
the remaining lenders have each committed between and million 
the billion facility replaced a million facility which was scheduled to expire in october we also have a demand note with availability of million 
there were no draws on these facilities during or our credit ratings have been unchanged since september when we issued billion in debt 
as of january   our ratings were as follows moody s standard poor s fitch long term debt baa bbb bbb we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved could be material 
during  we paid cash dividends of million as detailed in the following table first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter declaration date february  may  august  november  record date march  june  september  december  payment date march  june  september  december  amount per common share per common share per common share per common share on february   our board of directors approved a dividend of per common share which will be paid on march  to shareholders of record as of march  our financing activities used cash of million in and million in the increase is primarily due to treasury stock purchases in the fourth quarter of key financial ratios 
key financial ratios that provide certain measures of our liquidity are as follows working capital in millions current ratio debt capitalization ratio of earnings to fixed charges return on gross investment return on gross investment is a non gaap financial measure 
the decrease in working capital and the current ratio and the increase in the debt capitalization ratio as of year end compared to year end were primarily due to the repurchase of billion of our common stock in the net increase in our outstanding debt balances also contributed to the increase in the debt capitalization ratio 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was generally consistent with prior years 
see exhibit to this annual report on form k for the calculation of this ratio 
the decrease in working capital and the current ratio as of year end compared to year end was primarily due to the reclassification of million of debt maturing in from long term to short term and the repurchase of billion of kohl s common stock 
the debt capitalization ratio was comparable to  as share repurchases offset earnings in equity 
the increase in the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was primarily due to higher earnings 
our return on gross investment roi was for  for and for roi decreased in compared to as investments in stores  distribution centers and technology increased more than profitability 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher earnings 
roi is a non gaap financial measure which we define as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar divided by average gross investment 
our roi calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
roi should be evaluated in addition to  and not considered a substitute for  other financial measures such as return on assets 
we believe that roi measures how effectively we utilize our assets  excluding cash equivalents and long term investments  to generate earnings 
the following table includes our roi and return on assets the most comparable gaap measure calculations dollar in millions net income rent expense depreciation and amortization net interest provision for income taxes ebitdar average total assets cash equivalents and long term investments  deferred tax assets accumulated depreciation capitalized rent accounts payable accrued liabilities other long term liabilities gross investment agi return on assets roa return on gross investment roi represents average of most recent quarter end balances for and and the most recent year end balances for represents average of most recent quarter end balances for all periods represents excess cash not required for operations represents times store rent expense and times equipment other rent net income divided by average total assets ebitdar divided by gross investment debt covenant compliance 
our debt agreements contain various covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and the following leverage ratio as of january  dollars in millions total debt permitted exclusions subtotal rent x a included indebtedness a net worth investments accounted for under equity method subtotal included indebtedness b capitalization b leverage ratio a b maximum permitted leverage ratio as of january   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance during fiscal free cash flow 
we generated free cash flow of billion in and approximately million in the increase in free cash flow is primarily a result of higher cash provided by operating activities  as discussed above 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing obligations which generally represent landlord reimbursements of construction costs less acquisition of property equipment and capital lease financing obligation payments 
free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to  and not considered a substitute for  other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operating activities 
we believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations 
the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure to free cash flow a non gaap measure 
dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities acquisition of property equipment capital lease financing obligation payments proceeds from financing obligations free cash flow we expect to generate billion of free cash flow in fiscal contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of january  were as follows total less than year years years more than years in millions recorded contractual obligations long term debt capital lease and financing obligations unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments long term debt capital lease and financing obligations operating leases a royalties purchase obligations b other c total a our leases typically require that we pay real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above 
such costs vary from period to period and totaled million for  million for and million for the lease term includes cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in economic penalty 
b our purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise 
amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date 
c our other commitments include legally binding minimum lease and interest payments for stores opening in or later  as well as payments associated with technology agreements 
we have not included million of long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest and penalties in the contractual obligations table because we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements 
it is reasonably possible that such tax positions may change within the next months  primarily as a result of ongoing audits 
while it is possible that one or more of these audits may be resolved in the next year  it is not anticipated that payment of any such amounts in future periods will materially affect liquidity and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not provided any financial guarantees as of year end we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition  liquidity  results of operations or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors 
retail inventory method and inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in  first out fifo basis using the retail inventory method rim 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of the inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management estimates that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin 
the use of rim will generally result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
management estimates the need for an additional markdown reserve based on a review of historical clearance markdowns  current business trends  expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories 
we also record a reserve for estimated inventory shrink between the last physical inventory count and the balance sheet date 
shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss  inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods  among other things 
we generally perform an annual physical inventory count at each of our stores  distribution centers and e commerce fulfillment centers 
the shrink reserve is based on sales and actual shrink results from previous inventories 
we did not make any material changes in the methodologies used to value our inventory or to estimate the markdown and shrink reserves during  or we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory reserves 
though historical reserves have approximated actual markdowns and shrink adjustments  it is possible that future results could differ from current recorded reserves 
because we routinely record permanent markdowns for potentially obsolete merchandise  we do not believe that a markdown reserve was required as of january  changes in the assumptions used to estimate our markdown reserve requirement would not have had a material impact on our financial statements 
a basis point change in estimated inventory shrink would also have had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
vendor allowances we receive allowances from many of our merchandise vendors 
these allowances often are reimbursements for markdowns that we have taken in order to sell the merchandise and or to support the gross margins earned in connection with the sales of merchandise 
the allowances generally relate to sold inventory or permanent markdowns and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold 
allowances related to merchandise that has not yet been sold are recorded in inventory 
we also receive vendor allowances which represent reimbursements of costs primarily advertising that we have incurred to promote the vendors merchandise 
these allowances are generally netted against advertising or the other related costs as the costs are incurred 
advertising allowances in excess of costs incurred are recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs 
most of our vendor allowance agreements are supported by signed contracts which are binding  but informal in nature 
the terms and conditions of these arrangements vary significantly from vendor to vendor and are influenced by  among other things  the type of merchandise to be supported 
vendor allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory as well as advertising and other reimbursed costs 
insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks 
we retain the initial risk of  per occurrence in workers compensation claims and  per occurrence in general liability claims 
we record reserves for workers compensation and general liability claims which include the total amounts that we expect to pay for a fully developed loss and related expenses  such as fees paid to attorneys  experts and investigators 
the fully developed loss includes amounts for both reported claims and incurred  but not reported losses 
we use a third party actuary to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks 
the actuary considers historical claims experience  demographic and severity factors and actuarial assumptions to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks 
as of january   estimated liabilities for workers compensation and general liability claims  excluding administrative expenses and before pre funding  were approximately million 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
changes in actuarial assumptions could also have an impact on estimated reserves 
historically  our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results 
we are fully self insured for employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we use a third party actuary to estimate the liability for incurred  but not reported  health care claims 
this estimate uses historical claims information as well as estimated health care trends 
as of january   we had recorded approximately million for medical  pharmacy and dental claims which were incurred in and expected to be paid in historically  our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results 
effective january   we are self insured for a portion of our property losses 
as there were no significant property losses in january  we had no related reserves as of january  impairment of assets as of january   our investment in buildings and improvements  before accumulated depreciation  was billion 
we review these buildings and improvements for impairment when an event or changes in circumstances  such as decisions to close a store or significant operating losses  indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
for operating stores  a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the store assets are less than the net carrying amount of the assets 
if required  we would record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we estimate fair value as the net present value of cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual store  management estimates future store performance including sales growth rates  gross margin and controllable expenses  such as store payroll and occupancy expense 
projected cash flows must be estimated for future periods throughout the remaining life of the property  which may be as many as years in the future 
the accuracy of these estimates will be impacted by a number of factors including general economic conditions  changes in competitive landscape and our ability to effectively manage the operations of the store 
we have not historically experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets 
additionally  impairment of an individual building and related improvements  net of accumulated depreciation  would not generally be material to our financial results 
income taxes we regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal and state filings by considering all relevant facts  circumstances and information available to us 
if we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained  we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than likely to be realized 
our unrecognized tax benefit  excluding accrued interest and penalties  was million as of january  and million as of january  unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances 
also  as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse  it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable  deferred tax assets  tax reserves or income tax expense 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
operating leases as of january   of our  retail stores were subject to either a ground or building lease 
accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management 
application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine whether we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as a capital or operating lease in accordance with asc  leases 
if we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or the lease is considered a capital lease  we record the property and a related financing or capital lease obligation on our balance sheet 
the asset is then depreciated over its expected lease term 
rent payments for these properties are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the financing or capital lease obligation 
if the lease is considered an operating lease  it is not recorded on our balance sheet and rent expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
the most significant estimates used by management in accounting for property leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows expected lease term our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
a lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds of the leased asset s useful life 
the expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset or the straight line rent recognition period 
increasing the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher rent expense for an operating lease and higher interest and depreciation expenses for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet 
incremental borrowing rate we estimate our incremental borrowing rate using treasury rates for debt with maturities comparable to the expected lease term and our credit spread 
the incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
a lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than of the fair market value of the property 
increasing the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease 
for leases which are recorded on our balance sheet with a related capital lease or financing obligation  the incremental borrowing rate is also used in allocating our rental payments between interest expense and a reduction of the outstanding obligation 
fair market value of leased asset the fair market value of leased retail property is generally estimated based on comparable market data or consideration received from the landlord 
fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
a lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than of the fair market value of the property 
increasing the fair market value reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease 
fair market value is also used in determining the amount of property and related financing obligation to be recognized on our balance sheet for certain leased properties which are considered owned for accounting purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long term debt at year end is at fixed interest rates and  therefore  is not affected by changes in interest rates 
when our long term debt instruments mature  we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates  which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt 
cash equivalents and long term investments earn interest at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates 
during  average investments were billion and average yield was 
if interest rates on the average variable rate cash equivalents and long term investments increased by basis points  our annual interest income would also increase by approximately million assuming comparable investment levels 
we share in the net risk adjusted revenue of the kohl s credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges  late fees and other revenue less write offs of uncollectible accounts 
we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables if interest rates were to exceed defined rates 
as a result  our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates 
the reduced profitability  if any  will be impacted by various factors  including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance  and can not be reasonably estimated at this time
