our workforce optimization solution is designed to improve the productivity and profitability of small and medium sized businesses 
it relieves business owners and key executives of many employer related administrative and regulatory burdens  which enables them to focus on the core competencies of their businesses 
it also promotes employee performance through human resources management techniques designed to improve employee satisfaction 
we provide our workforce optimization solution by entering into a client service agreement csa  which establishes a three party relationship whereby we and our client act as co employers of the employees who work at the client s location worksite employees 
under the csa  we assume responsibility for personnel administration and compliance with most employment related governmental regulations  while the client retains the employees services in its business and remains the employer for various other purposes 
we charge a comprehensive service fee comprehensive service fee or gross billing  which is invoiced concurrently with the processing of payroll for the worksite employees of the client 
the comprehensive service fee consists of the payroll of our worksite employees and a markup computed as a percentage of the payroll cost of the worksite employees 

table of contents we accomplish the objectives of our workforce optimization solution through a high touch high tech approach to service delivery 
in advisory areas  such as recruiting  employee performance management and our employee training  we employ a high touch approach designed to ensure that our clients receive the personal attention and expertise needed to create a customized human resources solution 
for transactional processing  we employ a high tech approach that provides secure  convenient information exchange among insperity  our clients and our worksite employees  creating efficiencies for all parties 
the primary component of the high tech portion of our strategy is the employee service centersm esc 
the esc is our web based interactive workforce optimization solution delivery platform  which is designed to provide automated  personalized workforce optimization solutions to our clients and worksite employees 
as of december   we had sales offices in markets 
our long term strategy is to operate approximately sales offices located in strategically selected markets 
our national expansion strategy also includes multiple service centers  which coordinate workforce optimization solutions for clients on a regional basis and localized face to face human resources services 
as of december   we had four regional service centers along with human resources and client service personnel located in a majority of our sales markets  which serviced an average of  worksite employees per month in the fourth quarter of peo industry the peo industry began to evolve in the early s largely in response to the burdens placed on small and medium sized employers by an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment 
while various service providers were available to assist these businesses with specific tasks  peos emerged as providers of a more comprehensive range of services relating to the employer employee relationship 
in a peo arrangement  the peo assumes certain aspects of the employer employee relationship as defined in the contract between the peo and its client 
because peos provide employer related services to a large number of employees  they can achieve economies of scale that allow them to perform employment related functions more efficiently  provide a greater variety of employee benefits  and devote more attention to human resources management than a client can individually 
we believe the key factors driving demand for peo services include the focus on growth and productivity of the small and medium sized business community in the united states  utilizing outsourcing to concentrate on core competencies the need to provide competitive health care and related benefits to attract and retain employees the increasing costs associated with health and workers compensation insurance coverage  workplace safety programs  employee related complaints and litigation complex regulation of employment issues and the related costs of compliance  including the allocation of time and effort to such functions by owners and key executives a significant factor in the development of the peo industry has been increasing recognition and acceptance of peos and the co employer relationship by federal and state governmental authorities 
insperity and other industry leaders  in concert with the national association of professional employer organizations napeo  have worked with the relevant governmental entities for the establishment of a regulatory framework that protects clients and employees  discourages unscrupulous and financially unsound companies  and promotes further development of the industry 
currently  states have enacted legislation either recognizing peos or requiring licensing  registration  or certification  and several others are considering such regulation 
such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of peos 
state regulation assists in screening insufficiently capitalized peo operations and helps to resolve interpretive issues concerning employee status for specific purposes under applicable state law 
we have actively supported such regulatory efforts and are currently recognized  licensed  registered  certified or pursuing registration in all of these states 
the cost of compliance with these regulations is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents service offerings workforce optimizationtm solution we serve small and medium sized businesses by providing our workforce optimization solution  which encompasses a broad range of services  including the following as of december  benefits and payroll administration health and workers compensation insurance programs personnel records management employer liability management employee recruiting and selection employee performance management training and development services our workforce optimization solution is designed to attract and retain high quality employees  while relieving client owners and key executives of many employer related administrative and regulatory burdens

table of contents all of the following services are included in our workforce optimization solution and are available to all clients administrative functions 
administrative functions encompass a wide variety of processing and recordkeeping tasks  mostly related to payroll administration and government compliance 
specific examples include payroll processing payroll tax deposits quarterly payroll tax reporting employee file maintenance unemployment claims processing workers compensation claims reporting benefit plans administration 
we maintain several benefit plans including the following a group health plan a health care flexible spending account plan an educational assistance plan an adoption assistance plan group term life insurance group universal life insurance coverage accidental death and dismemberment insurance short term and long term disability insurance a k retirement plan a cafeteria plan the group health plan includes medical  dental  vision and prescription drug coverage  as well as a worklife program 
all benefit plans are provided to eligible employees based on the specific eligibility provisions of each plan 
we are the policyholder responsible for the costs and premiums associated with any group insurance policies that provide benefits under these plans  and we act as plan sponsor and administrator of the plans 
we negotiate the terms and costs of the plans  maintain the plans in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations and serve as liaison for the delivery of such benefits to worksite employees 
cobra coverage is extended to eligible terminated worksite and corporate employees and other eligible individuals  in accordance with applicable law 
we believe how we structure our benefit plan offerings are generally not available to employees in our small and medium sized business target market and are usually offered only by larger companies that can spread program costs over a much larger group of employees 
as a result  we believe the availability of these benefit plans provides our clients with a competitive advantage that small and medium sized businesses are typically unable to attain on their own 
personnel management 
we provide a wide variety of personnel management services that give our clients access to resources normally found only in the human resources departments of large companies 
all clients have access to our comprehensive personnel guide  which sets forth a systematic approach to administering personnel policies and practices  including recruiting  discipline and termination procedures

midmarket solutionstm 
we believe the mid market sector  which we define as those companies with employees ranging from to  worksite employees  has historically been under served by the peo industry 
currently  we have a dedicated sales management and consulting staff who concentrate solely on the mid market sector 
in addition  we have service personnel who have been trained and specialize in the mid market sector 
the mid market sector  which represented approximately of our total paid worksite employees during  increased over adjacent business unit offerings in  we initiated an adjacent business unit abu strategy  which seeks to expand the number of business performance improvement services available to our current and prospective client base and to provide the ability to offer these products and services outside of our workforce optimization solution 
insperity looks to leverage the existing customer relationships of the abus to cross sell our workforce optimization solution and various abu services 
execution of this abu strategy has included the acquisition of certain human resources technology companies that provide services through a saas delivery model 
during and  total abu revenues unrelated to our workforce optimization solution were and of our total revenues  respectively 
the following are the key components of our abu services 
table of contents performance management 
in  we announced the rebranding of our desktop software offering which includes insperitytm descriptions now  insperitytm policies now  insperitytm performance now  and insperitytm ultimate employer  formerly known as hrtoolstm  and launched insperitytm performsmart  the newly developed saas solution for employee performance reviews 
the new product expands and complements our existing small business software applications related to job descriptions  performance reviews  and personnel policies and procedures

beginning in early  these services will not be included in the comprehensive workforce optimization offering for new clients but will be offered separately to workforce optimization clients as part of our bundle plus strategy 
in addition  these services are offered outside of our workforce optimization solution 
business insurance 
our business insurance business unit  through alliances with selected third party insurance carriers  allows small businesses to secure affordable  customizable business insurance packages 
client service agreement all workforce optimization clients execute an insperity csa 
the csa generally provides for an ongoing relationship between insperity and the workforce optimization client 
the csa generally is subject to termination by insperity or the client upon days written notice or upon shorter notice in the event of default 
the csa establishes our comprehensive service fee  which is subject to periodic adjustments to account for changes in the composition of the client s workforce  employee benefit election changes and statutory changes that affect our costs 
under the provisions of the csa  clients active in january of any year are obligated to pay the estimated payroll tax component of the comprehensive service fee in a manner that reflects the pattern of incurred payroll tax costs 
this practice aligns clients payments to insperity for payroll taxes with insperity s obligations to make payments to tax authorities  which are higher in the earlier part of the year  and decrease as limits on wages subject to payroll tax  are reached 
new clients enrolling subsequent to january of any year are invoiced at a relatively constant rate throughout the remaining portion of the year  resulting in insperity s improving profitability over the course of the year for those clients because of the typical pattern of incurred payroll tax costs 

table of contents the csa also establishes the division of responsibilities between insperity and the client as co employers 
pursuant to the csa  we are responsible for personnel administration and are liable for compliance with certain employment related government regulations 
in addition  we assume liability for payment of salaries and wages as well as related payroll taxes of our worksite employees and responsibility for providing specified employee benefits to such persons 
these liabilities are not contingent on the prepayment by the client of the associated comprehensive service fee and  as a result of our employment relationship with each of our worksite employees  we are liable for payment of salary and wages to the worksite employees as reported by the client and are responsible for providing specified employee benefits to such persons  regardless of whether the client pays the associated comprehensive service fee 
the client retains the employees services and remains liable for complying with certain government regulations  that require control of the worksite or daily supervisory responsibility or is otherwise beyond our ability to assume 
a third group of responsibilities and liabilities are shared by insperity and the client where such joint responsibility is appropriate 
the specific division of applicable responsibilities under the majority of csas are as follows insperity payment of wages and salaries as reported by the client and related tax reporting and remittance local  state and federal withholding  fica  futa  state unemployment workers compensation compliance  procurement  management and reporting compliance with the code  cobra  hipaa and erisa for each employee benefit plan sponsored solely by insperity  as well as monitoring changes in other governmental regulations governing the employer employee relationship and updating the client when necessary employee benefits administration of plans sponsored solely by insperity client payment  through insperity  of commissions  bonuses  paid leaves of absence and severance payments payment and related tax reporting and remittance of non qualified deferred compensation and equity based compensation ownership and protection of all client intellectual property rights compliance with osha regulations  epa regulations  flsa  fmla  warn  userra and state and local equivalents and compliance with government contracting provisions compliance with the national labor relations act nlra  including all organizing efforts and expenses related to a collective bargaining agreement and related benefits professional licensing requirements  fidelity bonding and professional liability insurance products produced and or services provided cobra  hipaa and erisa compliance for client sponsored benefit plans joint implementation of policies and practices relating to the employee employer relationship compliance with all federal  state and local employment laws  including  but not limited to title vii of the civil rights act of  adea  title i of ada  the consumer credit protection act  and immigration laws and regulations 
table of contents we maintain employment practice liability insurance coverages including coverages for our clients to manage our exposure for various employee related claims  and as a result  our incurred costs with respect to this exposure have historically been insignificant to our operating results 
because we are a co employer with the client for some purposes  it is possible that we could incur liability for violations of such laws  even if we are not responsible for the conduct giving rise to such liability 
the csa addresses this issue by providing that the client will indemnify us for liability incurred to the extent the liability is attributable to conduct by the client 
notwithstanding this contractual right to indemnification  it is possible that we could be unable to collect on a claim for indemnification and may therefore be ultimately responsible for satisfying the liability in question 
in most instances  clients are required to remit their comprehensive service fees no later than one day prior to the applicable payroll date by wire transfer or automated clearinghouse transaction 
although we are ultimately liable  as the employer for payroll purposes  to pay employees for work previously performed  we retain the ability to terminate immediately the csa and associated worksite employees or to require prepayment  letters of credit or other collateral upon deterioration in a client s financial condition or upon non payment by a client 
these rights  the periodic nature of payroll  and the overall quality of our client base have resulted in an excellent overall collections history 
workforce optimization clients insperity s workforce optimization solution provides a value added  full service human resources solution we believe is most suitable to a specific segment of the small and medium sized business community 
we target successful businesses with to  employees that recognize the advantage in the strategic use of high performance human resources practices 
we refer to clients with to  employees as mid market clients 
these clients  which represented approximately of our total client base as of december   are sold and serviced by sales and service personnel who specialize in the mid market sector 
we have set a long term goal to serve approximately of the overall small and medium sized business community 
we serve clients and worksite employees located throughout the united states 
by region  our revenue change compared to and revenue distribution for the year ended december   was as follows revenue change of total revenues northeast southeast central southwest west as part of our client selection strategy  we generally do not offer our workforce optimization solution to businesses falling within certain specified naics north american industry classification system codes  attempting to minimize our exposure to certain industries which we believe present a higher employer risk such as employee injury  high turnover or litigation 
all prospective workforce optimization clients are evaluated individually on the basis of workers compensation risk  group medical history where permitted by law  unemployment history  operating stability and human resources practices 

table of contents our client base is broadly distributed throughout a wide variety of industries including industry of client base computer and information services management  administration and consulting services finance  insurance and real estate manufacturing wholesale trade engineering  accounting and legal services medical services retail trade construction other this diverse client base lowers our exposure to downturns or volatility in any particular industry 
however  our performance could be affected by a downturn in one of these industries or by general economic conditions within the small and medium sized business community 
we focus heavily on client retention 
during and  our retention rate was approximately and  respectively 
insperity s client retention record over the last five years reflects that approximately of our workforce optimization clients remain for more than one year 
the average annual retention rate over the last five years was approximately 
client attrition is attributable to a variety of factors  including i client non renewal due to price or service factors  ii client business failure  sale  merger  or disposition  iii our termination of the csa resulting from the client s non compliance or inability to make timely payments  and iv competition from other peos or business services firms 

table of contents marketing and sales as of december   we had workforce optimization sales offices located in markets 
our long term goal is to operate sales offices in strategically selected markets 
our sales offices typically consist of six to eight business performance advisors bpas  a district sales manager and an office administrator 
to take advantage of economic efficiencies  multiple sales offices may share a physical location 
insperity s markets and their respective year of entry are as follows initial market sales offices entry date houston san antonio austin orlando dallas fort worth atlanta phoenix chicago washington dc denver los angeles charlotte st 
louis san francisco new york baltimore new jersey san diego boston minneapolis raleigh kansas city columbus nashville our existing and future markets are identified using a systematic market evaluation and selection process 
we continue to evaluate a broad range of factors in the selection process  using a market selection model that weights various criteria we believe are reliable predictors of successful penetration based on our experience 
among the factors we consider are market size  in terms of small and medium sized businesses engaged in selected industries that meet our risk profile market receptivity to peo services  including the regulatory environment and relevant history with other peo providers existing relationships within a given market  such as vendor or client relationships expansion cost issues  such as advertising and overhead costs direct cost issues that bear on our effectiveness in controlling and managing the cost of our services  such as workers compensation and health insurance costs  unemployment risks and various legal and other factors a comparison of the services we offer to alternatives available to small and medium sized businesses in the relevant market  such as the cost to the target clients of procuring services directly or through other peos long term strategy issues  such as the general perception of markets and our estimate of the long term revenue growth potential of the market 
table of contents each of our expansion markets  beginning with dallas in  was selected in this manner 
in  we launched our rebranding initiative whereby administaff became insperity  a new brand backed by an innovative strategy for meeting the ongoing performance needs of america s best companies 
the name insperity is drawn from the linked entrepreneurial goals of inspiration and prosperity  and underscores our ongoing vision of helping businesses succeed 
our marketing strategy is based on the application of techniques that have produced consistent and predictable results in the past 
we develop a mix of national and local advertising media and a placement strategy tailored to each individual market 
after selecting a market and developing our marketing mix  but prior to entering the market  we engage in an organized media and public relations campaign to prepare the market for our entry and to begin the process of generating sales leads 
we market our services through various business promotions and a broad range of media outlets  including television  radio  newspapers  periodicals  direct mail and the internet 
we employ public relations firms for most of our markets as well as advertising consultants to coordinate and implement our marketing campaigns 
we have developed an inventory of television  radio and newsprint advertisements  which are utilized in this effort 
we continuously seek to develop new marketing approaches and campaigns to capitalize on changes in the competitive landscape for our human resources services and to more successfully reach our target market 
we have an agreement with the professional golf association champions tour to be the title sponsor of the annual insperity championshiptm presented by unitedhealthcare professional golf tournament held annually in the woodlands  texas a suburb of houston 
in addition  we have arrangements with arnold palmer and jim nantz  a sports commentator  to serve as our national spokespersons 
our marketing campaigns use this event and the relationships with mr 
palmer and mr 
nantz as a focal point of our brand marketing efforts 
our organic growth model generates sales leads from five primary sources direct sales efforts  advertising  referrals  marketing alliances and the internet 
these leads result in initial presentations to prospective workforce optimization clients  and ultimately  prospective workforce optimization client census reports 
a prospective workforce optimization client s census report reflects information gathered by the bpa about the prospect s employees  including job classification  state of employment  workers compensation claims history  group medical information where permitted by law  salary and desired level of benefits 
this information is entered into our customized bid system  which applies insperity s proprietary pricing model to the census data  leading to the preparation of a bid 
concurrent with this process  we evaluate the prospective client s workers compensation  health insurance  employer practices and financial stability from a risk management perspective 
upon completion of a favorable risk evaluation  the bpa presents the bid and attempts to enroll the prospect 
our selling process typically takes approximately days for clients with less than employees  and up to approximately days for larger clients 
the process can be extended during economic downturns 
we have implemented cross selling channels between our workforce optimization business and our abus in order to execute on our abu strategy 
this strategy focuses on using our workforce optimization offering to increase market penetration in each of our abu businesses and using our abu offering as a source of leads for our workforce optimization solution 
the cross selling channels reduce barriers to selling our products and services and results in tailored service packages to better meet the specific needs of the business 
competition we provide a value added  full service human resources solution through our workforce optimization solution  which we believe is most suitable to a specific segment of the small and medium sized business community 
this full service approach is exemplified by our commitment to provide a high level of service and technology personnel  which has produced a ratio of corporate staff to worksite employees the staff support ratio that is higher than average for the peo industry 
based on an analysis of the through annual napeo surveys of the peo industry  we have successfully leveraged our full service approach into significantly higher returns for insperity on a per worksite employee per month basis 
during the three year period from through  our staff support ratio averaged higher than the peo industry average 
during the same three year period  our gross profit per worksite employee and operating income per worksite employee exceeded industry averages by and  respectively 

table of contents competition in the peo industry revolves primarily around quality of services  scope of services  choice and quality of benefits packages  reputation and price 
we believe reputation  national presence  regulatory expertise  financial resources  risk management and information technology capabilities distinguish leading peos from the rest of the industry 
we also believe we compete favorably in these areas 
due to the differing geographic regions and market segments in which most peos operate  and the relatively low level of market penetration by the industry  we consider our primary competition to be the traditional in house provision of human resources services 
the peo industry is highly fragmented  and we believe insperity is one of the largest peo service providers in the united states 
our largest national competitors include peo divisions of large business services companies such as automatic data processing  inc and paychex  inc  and other peos  such as trinet 
in addition  we compete to some extent with i fee for service providers such as payroll processors and human resources consultants  ii human resources technology solution companies  and iii large regional peos in certain areas of the country 
as insperity and other large peo service providers expand nationally  we expect that competition may intensify 
vendor relationships insperity provides benefits to its worksite employees under arrangements with a variety of vendors 
we consider our contracts with unitedhealthcare united and member insurance companies of ace american insurance company ace to be the most significant elements of our employee benefits package 
these contracts would be the most difficult to replace 
we provide group health insurance coverage to our worksite employees through a national network of carriers including united  kaiser permanente  blue shield of california  hmsa bluecross blueshield of hawaii  unity health plan and tufts  all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts 
the health insurance contract with united provides approximately of our health insurance coverage and expires on december   subject to cancellation by either party upon days notice 
for a discussion of our contract with united  which is accounted for using a partially self funded insurance accounting model  please read item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates benefits costs 
our workers compensation coverage the ace program has been provided through an arrangement with ace since the ace program is a fully insured policy whereby ace has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities 
for additional discussion of the ace program  which includes terms shifting some of the economic burden to us  please read item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates workers compensation costs 
information technology insperity utilizes a variety of information technology capabilities to provide its human resources services to workforce optimization clients and worksite employees and for its own administrative and management information requirements 
insperity s information management system is a proprietary workforce optimization information system that utilizes both purchased and internally developed software applications 
this system manages transactions and information unique to the workforce optimization solution and to insperity  including worksite employee enrollment human resources management benefits and defined contribution plan administration payroll processing client invoicing and collection management information and reporting 
table of contents sales bid calculations central to the system are transaction processing capabilities that allow us to process a high volume of payroll  invoice  and bid transactions that meet the specific needs of our clients and prospects 
we administer our employee benefits through a proprietary application designed to process employee eligibility and enrollments  manage carrier relationships  and maintain a variety of plan offerings 
our retirement services operations are conducted utilizing an industry leading retirement plan administration application in a third party hosted environment 
aspects of all of these components are delivered to our workforce optimization clients and worksite employees through the esc 
we utilize commercially available software for other business functions such as finance and accounting  contract and litigation management  sales force activity management and customer relationship management 
insperity has hosting facilities located at our corporate headquarters in kingwood  texas a suburb of houston  and in bryan  texas 
the hosting facilities house all of our business applications  telecommunications equipment and network equipment 
each hosting facility houses a mix of primary production applications  disaster recovery  replication and back up applications  and pre production environments 
both hosting facilities are designed to run all of our critical business applications and have sufficient capacity to handle all of our operations on a stand alone basis  if required 
periodically  we perform testing to ensure our disaster recovery capabilities remain effective and available 
we also utilize additional leased hosting facilities for certain of our business units 
our network infrastructure ensures appropriate connectivity exists among all of our facilities and employees and provides appropriate internet connectivity to conduct business with our clients and worksite employees 
the network infrastructure is provided through industry standard core network hardware and via high speed network services provided by multiple vendors 
we have incorporated a variety of measures to maintain the security and privacy of the information managed through our systems and applications 
these measures include industry standard technologies designed to protect  monitor and assess the network environment  best practice security policies and procedures  and standard access controls designed to control access to sensitive and private information 
industry regulations insperity s workforce optimization operations are affected by numerous federal and state laws relating to tax  insurance and employment matters 
by entering into a co employer relationship with our worksite employees  we assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under these federal and state laws 
because many of these federal and state laws were enacted prior to the development of nontraditional employment relationships  such as peos  temporary employment and outsourcing arrangements  many of these laws do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of nontraditional employers 
currently  states have passed laws that recognize peos or require licensing  registration or certification requirements for peos  and several others are considering such regulation 
as an employer  we are subject to federal statutes and regulations governing the employer employee relationship 
subject to the issues discussed below  we believe that our operations are in compliance  in all material respects  with all applicable federal statutes and regulations 
employee benefit plans we offer various employee benefits plans to eligible employees  including our worksite employees 
these plans include a k retirement plan a cafeteria plan under code section a group health plan  which includes medical  dental  vision and prescription drug coverage  as well as a worklife program a welfare benefits plan  which includes life  disability and accidental death and dismemberment coverage 
table of contents a health care flexible spending account plan an educational assistance program an adoption assistance program generally  employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of the code  erisa and cobra 
employer status 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  employee benefit plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
generally  an entity is an employer of individuals for federal employment tax purposes if an employment relationship exists between the entity and the individuals under the common law test of employment 
in addition  the officers of a corporation are deemed to be employees of that corporation for federal employment tax purposes 
the common law test of employment  as applied by the irs  involves an examination of approximately factors to ascertain whether an employment relationship exists between a worker and a purported employer 
generally  the test is applied to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or an employee for federal employment tax purposes and not to determine whether each of two or more companies is a co employer 
substantial weight is typically given to the question of whether the purported employer has the right to direct and control the details of an individual s work 
among the factors that appear to have been considered more important by the irs are the employer s degree of behavioral control the extent of instructions  training and the nature of the work the financial control or the economic aspects of the relationship the intended relationship of the parties whether employee benefits are provided  whether any contracts exist  whether services are ongoing or for a project  whether there are any penalties for discharge termination  and the frequency of the business activity erisa requirements 
employee pension and welfare benefit plans are also governed by erisa 
erisa defines employer as any person acting directly as an employer  or indirectly in the interest of an employer  in relation to an employee benefit plan 
erisa defines the term employee as any individual employed by an employer 
the united states supreme court has held that the common law test of employment must be applied to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under erisa 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a peo or employee leasing arrangement has not been established 
if insperity were found not to be an employer with respect to worksite employees for erisa purposes  its plans would not comply with erisa 
further  as a result of such finding  insperity and its plans would not enjoy  with respect to worksite employees  the preemption of state laws provided by erisa and could be subject to varying state laws and regulations  as well as to claims based upon state common laws 
even if such a finding were made  we believe we would not be materially adversely affected because we could continue to make available similar benefits at comparable costs 
in addition to erisa and the code provisions discussed herein  issues related to the relationship between insperity and its worksite employees may also arise under other federal laws  including other federal income tax laws 
patient protection and affordable care act 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca was signed into law on march  the ppaca was subsequently amended on march   by the reconciliation act 
the ppaca and the reconciliation act collectively the act entail sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from through  and many provisions in the act require the issuance of additional guidance from the us department of labor  the internal revenue service irs  the us department of health human services and the states 
many provisions of the act do not become operative until future years 
the act did not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in  and we do not expect the act to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in however  given the length and complexity of the act  the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented  and the unknown impact of regulatory guidance  much of which has not been issued  we are unable to determine the impact of the act on our health insurance plan in future periods 

table of contents the number and complex nature of federal and state regulations facing employers has continued to increase over time  including the enactment of the act 
we believe that additional regulatory burdens placed on employers can increase the demand for our services because small and medium sized businesses are especially challenged by such governmental regulations due to limited resources and the lack of expertise 
as a co employer in the peo relationship  we assume or share many of the employer related responsibilities and assist our clients in complying with many employment related governmental regulations 
historically  we believe we have successfully marketed the compliance component of our service offering and that our compliance related services have increased the value proposition of our service offering 
however  currently we are unable to determine the impact the act will have in future periods on the costs we will incur to comply with the act  our ability to match any resulting increased costs with pricing  our ability to attract and retain clients  our business model and our results of operations 
beginning in  the act provided for a small business tax credit for eligible companies offering health care coverage to employees 
based upon information contained in the congressional record  which specifically references peos  we believe that these tax credits are available to our clients that meet the qualification requirements 
however  the act and subsequently issued irs guidance do not expressly address the issue of whether qualifying small business clients of a peo are entitled to the tax credits 
at this time  we are unable to determine whether this issue will have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to attract and retain clients 
beginning in  the act required a number of mandates for health insurance plans  some of which were already standard in our group health plan 
for mandates not already included  we worked with our insurance carriers to incorporate the required changes 
insperity previously elected not to claim a grandfathered plan exemption for its group health plan 
while we are unable to determine the impact of the required plan changes and grandfathered plan rules at this time  in future periods they may result in increased costs to us and could affect our ability to attract and retain clients 
additionally  contractual arrangements and competitive market conditions may limit or delay our ability to increase service fees to offset the associated potential increased costs 
beginning in  the act provides for the establishment of state insurance exchanges exchanges to make health insurance available to individuals and small employers initially defined as employees or less 
small business tax credits and subsidies will be available to qualifying businesses and individuals who purchase health insurance through the exchanges 
also in  the act implements pay or play penalties for large employers those with at least full time equivalent employees who fail to offer minimum essential coverage or affordable coverage to employees 
in  the act implements rules imposing excise taxes on employers who offer excessive health benefits under so called cadillac plans 
we anticipate taking appropriate steps to avoid  to the extent necessary and possible  incurring any such excise taxes 
at this time  we are unable to determine the effect the exchanges  pay or play penalties  and excise taxes will have on our costs  our ability to match pricing with any increased costs  our results of operations or our ability to attract and retain clients 
moreover  multiple lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the act have been filed since enactment 
there have been conflicting rulings issued in these lawsuits as to whether or not certain provisions of the act are constitutional 
most recently  on january   a federal court in florida ruled that the entire act was unconstitutional 
in november  the united states supreme court agreed to hear challenges to the act with respect to the constitutionality of whether an individual can be compelled to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage or be forced to pay a financial penalty commonly referred to as the individual mandate  whether the individual mandate can be severed from the rest of the act and whether states can be forced to expand their share of medicaid costs or risk losing funding if the state refuses 
a decision from the supreme court is expected in june we are unable to determine the impact  if any  the court s ruling s may have on our operations or our ability to attract and retain clients 
k retirement plans 
our k retirement plans are operated pursuant to guidance provided by the irs under revenue procedure and revenue procedure  each of which provides guidance for the operation of defined contribution plans maintained by peos that benefit worksite employees 
this guidance provides qualification standards for peo plans which  if met  negate the inquiry of common law employer status for purposes of the exclusive benefit rule 
all of insperity s k retirement plans have received determination letters from the irs confirming the qualified status of the plans 

table of contents employment taxes as a co employer  insperity assumes responsibility and liability for the payment of federal and state employment taxes with respect to wages and salaries paid to our worksite employees 
there are essentially three types of federal employment tax obligations withholding of income tax requirements governed by code section  et seq 
obligations under fica  governed by code section  et seq 
obligations under futa  governed by code section  et seq 
under these code sections  employers have the obligation to withhold and remit the employer portion and  where applicable  the employee portion of these taxes 
code section  which applies to federal income tax withholding requirements  contains an exception to the general common law test applied to determine whether an entity is an employer for purposes of federal income tax withholding 
section d states that if the person for whom services are rendered does not have control of the payment of wages  the employer for this purpose is the person having control of the payment of wages 
the treasury regulations issued under section d state that a third party can be deemed to be the employer of workers under this section for income tax withholding purposes where the person for whom services are rendered does not have legal control of the payment of wages 
while section d has been examined by several courts  its ultimate scope has not been delineated 
moreover  the irs has to date relied extensively on the common law test of employment in determining liability for failure to comply with federal income tax withholding requirements 
accordingly  while we believe that we can assume the withholding obligations for worksite employees  in the event we fail to meet these obligations  the client may be held ultimately liable for those obligations 
while this interpretive issue has not to our knowledge discouraged clients from enrolling with insperity  there can be no assurance that a definitive adverse resolution of this issue would not do so in the future 
these interpretive uncertainties may also impact our ability to report employment taxes on our own account rather than the accounts of our clients 
unemployment taxes we record our state unemployment sui tax expense based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state 
state unemployment tax rates vary by state and are determined  in part  based on insperity s prior years compensation experience in each state 
certain rates are determined  in part  by each client s own compensation experience 
in addition  states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax rates  including retroactively  to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds 
due to the adverse us economic conditions during recent years and the associated reductions in employment levels  the state unemployment funds have experienced a significant increase in the number of unemployment claims 
accordingly  state unemployment tax rates increased substantially in and and further increases are expected in rate notices are typically provided by the states during  or prior to  the first quarter of each year  however  some notices are received later 
until we receive the final tax rate notices  we estimate our expected sui rate in those particular states 
employers in certain states are experiencing higher futa tax rates as a result of certain states not repaying their loans from the federal government in a timely manner 
we are obligated to pay the federal government at a higher rate in these situations 
as such  we estimate the additional tax owed in states that have had a history of not repaying their federal loans in a timely manner 
state regulation while many states do not explicitly regulate peos  states have adopted provisions for licensing  registration  certification or recognition of peos  and several others are considering such regulation 
such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of peos  and in some cases codify and clarify the co employment relationship for unemployment  workers compensation and other purposes under state law 
insperity is in compliance with the requirements in all states 
regardless of whether a state has licensing  registration or certification requirements for peos  we must comply with a number of other state and local regulations that could impact our operations 

table of contents corporate office employees we had approximately  corporate employees as of december  we believe our relations with our corporate employees are good 
none of our corporate employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
intellectual property insperity currently has registered trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property 
in connection with our rebranding efforts in  we applied for registration of our new trademarks which are currently pending 
we believe that our trademarks as a whole are of considerable importance to our business 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
factors that may affect future results and the market price of common stock continued effects of the economic recession may adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations over the past several years  the united states economy has experienced negative economic conditions 
although conditions have improved over the last two years  the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable than in years past 
in addition  disruptions in national and international credit markets have lead to a scarcity of credit  tighter lending standards and higher interest rates on business loans 
the continued effects of the economic recession or a continuing scarcity of credit could adversely affect the financial condition and levels of business activity of our clients 
recent economic conditions have had  and may continue to have  a corresponding negative impact on our operating results as some of our clients may suffer business failures  and others may react to worsening conditions by reducing their employee headcount  lowering their wage and bonus levels  lowering their spending on other human resources benefits and services or determining not to outsource those services to us 
in addition  economic conditions may impair our ability to attract new clients 
these circumstances significantly impacted our results  resulting in a decline in the number of worksite employees paid per month that year as compared to although worksite employee levels have more recently increased  the  average number of paid worksite employees per month in is flat compared to levels 
in addition  we expect the average number of paid worksite employees per month to be in the range of  to  in the first quarter of negative economic conditions could continue to have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 
we assume liability for worksite employee payroll  payroll taxes and benefits costs and are responsible for their payment regardless of the amount billed to or paid by our clients under the csa  we become a co employer of worksite employees and assume the obligations to pay the salaries  wages and related benefits costs and payroll taxes of such worksite employees 
we assume such obligations as a principal  not as an agent of the client 
our obligations include responsibility for payment of the salaries and wages for work performed by worksite employees  regardless of whether the client timely pays us the associated service fee withholding and payment of federal and state payroll taxes with respect to wages and salaries reported by insperity providing benefits to worksite employees even if our costs to provide such benefits exceed the fees the client pays us if a client does not pay us  or if the costs of benefits we provide to worksite employees exceed the fees a client pays us  our ultimate liability for worksite employee payroll and benefits costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
increases in health insurance premiums or inability to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations maintaining health insurance plans that cover worksite employees is a significant part of our business 
our primary health insurance contract expires on december   subject to cancellation by either party upon days notice 
in the event we are unable to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms  significant disruption to our business could occur 
health insurance premiums are in part determined by our claims experience and comprise a significant portion of our direct costs 
we employ extensive risk management procedures in an attempt to control our claims incidence and structure our benefits contracts to provide as much cost stability as possible 
however  if we experience a sudden and unexpected large increase in claim activity  our health insurance costs could increase 
claim activity levels are impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  macro economic changes  proposed and enacted regulatory changes and medical outbreaks 
for example  during and we experienced higher claims associated with the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
contractual arrangements with our clients limit our ability to incorporate such increases into service fees  which could result in a delay before such increases could be reflected in service fees 
as a result  such increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

increases in workers compensation costs or inability to secure replacement coverage on competitive terms could lead to a significant disruption to our business our workers compensation coverage has been provided through an arrangement with ace since under our current arrangement with ace  we bear the economic burden for the first million layer of claims per occurrence and the economic burden for claims over million  up to a maximum aggregate amount of million per policy year for claims that exceed the first million 
ace bears the burden for all claims in excess of these levels 
the ace program is a fully insured policy whereby ace has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities 
for additional discussion of our policy with ace  please read item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates workers compensation costs 
workers compensation costs are a significant portion of our direct costs 
if we were to experience a sudden and unexpected large increase in the number or severity of claims  our workers compensation costs could increase  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the current workers compensation coverage with ace expires on september  in the event we are unable to secure replacement coverage on competitive terms  significant disruption to our business could occur 
our captive insurance subsidiary tax status could be challenged resulting in an acceleration of income tax payments in conjunction with the formation of the current workers compensation program in  we formed a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive 
we recognize the captive as an insurance company for federal income tax purposes  with respect to our consolidated federal income tax return 
in the event the irs were to determine that the captive does not qualify as an insurance company  we could be required to make accelerated income tax payments to the irs that we otherwise would have deferred until future periods 

table of contents our ability to adjust and collect service fees for increases in unemployment tax rates may be limited we record our sui tax expense based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state 
state unemployment tax rates vary by state and are determined  in part  based on prior years compensation experience in each state 
prior to the receipt of final tax rate notices  we estimate our expected sui tax rate in those states for which tax rate notices have not yet been received for purposes of pricing 
due to adverse economic conditions in recent years and the associated reductions in employment levels  the state unemployment funds have experienced a significant increase in the number of unemployment claims 
accordingly  state unemployment tax rates increased substantially in and in addition  some states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax rates retroactively to cover deficiencies in the unemployment fund 
generally  our contractual agreements allow us to incorporate such increases into our service fees upon the effective date of the rate change 
however  our ability to fully adjust service fees in our billing systems and collect such increases over the remaining term of the customers contracts could be limited  resulting in a potential tax increase not being fully recovered 
as a result  such increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
for additional information related to state unemployment taxes  please read note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
our contracts may be cancelled on short notice 
our inability to renew client contracts or attract new clients could materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations our standard csa can generally be cancelled by us or the client with days notice 
accordingly  the short term nature of the csa makes us vulnerable to potential cancellations by existing clients  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our results of operations are dependent in part upon our ability to retain or replace our clients upon the termination or cancellation of the csa 
our client attrition rate was approximately in there can be no assurance that the number of contract cancellations will continue at these levels and such cancellations may increase in the future due to various factors  including but not limited to  economic conditions in the markets we operate 
established competitors and new market entrants may have greater resources that give them competitive advantage over us the human resources services industry  including the peo industry  is highly fragmented 
many peos have limited operations and fewer than  worksite employees  but there are several industry participants that are comparable to our size or larger 
we also encounter competition from fee for service companies such as payroll processing firms  insurance companies and human resources consultants 
our competitors include the peo divisions of large business services companies  such as automatic data processing  inc and paychex  inc  and other peos such as trinet 
the peo divisions of such large business services companies with substantially greater resources than insperity may be able to provide their peo services at more competitive prices than we may be able to offer 
moreover  we expect that as the peo industry grows and its regulatory framework becomes better established  well organized competition with greater resources than we have may enter the peo market  possibly including large fee for service companies currently providing a more limited range of services 
we may be subject to liabilities for client and employee actions a number of legal issues remain unresolved with respect to the co employment arrangement between a peo and its worksite employees  including questions concerning the ultimate liability for violations of employment and discrimination laws 
our csa establishes the contractual division of responsibilities between insperity and our clients for various personnel management matters  including compliance with and liability under various governmental regulations 
we maintain certain general insurance coverages including coverages for our clients to manage certain exposure for various employee related claims  and as a result  the costs in excess of insurance premiums we incur with respect to this exposure have historically been insignificant to our operating results 
because we act as a co employer  we may be subject to liability for violations of various employment and discrimination laws despite these contractual provisions  even if we do not participate in such violations 
although the csa provides that the client is to indemnify us for any liability attributable to the client s conduct  we may not be able to collect on such a contractual indemnification claim and thus may be responsible for satisfying such liabilities to the extent that such liabilities are not covered or insured against under our insurance policies 
in addition  worksite employees may be deemed to be our agents  which may subject us to liability for the actions of such worksite employees 

table of contents changes in federal  state and local regulation or our inability to obtain licenses under new regulatory frameworks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as a major employer  our operations are affected by numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to labor  tax  benefit  insurance and employment matters 
by entering into a co employer relationship with employees assigned to work at client locations  we assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under these laws 
however  many of these laws such as erisa and federal and state employment tax laws do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of non traditional employers such as peos  and the definition of employer under these laws is not uniform 
in addition  many of the states in which we operate have not addressed the peo relationship for purposes of compliance with applicable state laws governing the employer employee relationship 
any adverse application of new or existing federal or state laws to the peo relationship with our worksite employees and client companies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
while many states do not explicitly regulate peos  states have passed laws that have recognition  licensing  certification or registration requirements for peos and several other states are considering such regulation 
such laws vary from state to state  but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of peos  and in some cases codify and clarify the co employment relationship for unemployment  workers compensation and other purposes under state law 
while we generally support licensing regulation because it serves to validate the peo relationship  we may not be able to satisfy licensing requirements or other applicable regulations for all states 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our licenses in all states 
geographic market concentration makes our results of operations vulnerable to economic factors our houston  texas including houston  and california markets accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our worksite employees for the year ended december  accordingly  while we have a goal of expanding in our current markets and into new markets  for the foreseeable future  a significant portion of our revenues may be subject to economic factors specific to texas and california 
a determination that a client is liable for employment taxes not paid by a peo may discourage clients from contracting with us in the future under the csa  we assume sole responsibility and liability for paying federal employment taxes imposed under the code with respect to wages and salaries we pay our worksite employees 
there are essentially three types of federal employment tax obligations income tax withholding requirements fica futa under the code  employers have the obligation to withhold and remit the employer portion and  where applicable  the employee portion of these taxes 
most states impose similar employment tax obligations on the employer 
while the csa provides that we have sole legal responsibility for making these tax contributions  the irs or applicable state taxing authority could conclude that such liability cannot be completely transferred to us 
accordingly  in the event that we fail to meet our tax withholding and payment obligations  the client may be held jointly and severally liable for those obligations 
while this interpretive issue has not  to our knowledge  discouraged clients from enrolling with insperity  a definitive adverse resolution of this issue may discourage clients from enrolling in the future 

table of contents potential disclosure of sensitive or private information could damage our reputation and impact our operating results unauthorized access or unintentional disclosure of personal information could damage our reputation and operating results 
while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations  and maintain stringent privacy and security policies and procedures  any failure or perceived failure to adequately protect sensitive information may result in negative publicity and or proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others  which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 
most states and the district of columbia have enacted notification rules concerning privacy and data protection 
it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices 
if so  in addition to the possibility of fines  this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices  which could have a material effect on our business 
complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
the failure of our insurance carriers or financial institutions could have a material adverse effect on us insperity contracts with various insurance carriers to provide certain insurance coverages as a part of our workforce optimization solution  which includes health insurance  workers compensation insurance and employment practices liability insurance 
in addition  insperity obtains insurance coverage for various commercial risks in our business such as property insurance  errors and omissions insurance  general liability insurance  fiduciary liability insurance  automobile liability insurance  and directors and officers liability insurance 
the failure of any insurance carrier providing such coverage could leave insperity exposed to uninsured risk and could have a material adverse effect upon insperity 
during the third quarter of  it was publicly reported that american international group  inc aig parent experienced significant financial difficulties  and the united states federal reserve federal reserve approved emergency financial assistance to aig parent 
aig parent received additional financial assistance from the federal reserve in selected member insurance companies of aig parent the selected member carriers provide employment practices liability epl insurance to insperity and our clients  and also remain as the carriers for all workers compensation claim activity incurred between september  and september  as of december   aig held funds of million  which is included in restricted cash and deposits on our consolidated balance sheets  to pay remaining claims under the aig workers compensation program 
although aig parent has publicly stated that its selected member carriers remain well capitalized and financially secure  in the event that the selected member carriers fail and are placed into receivership or a similar proceeding  the claim funds held by aig would not necessarily be used to pay our remaining workers compensation claims 
instead  the claims could be paid by guaranty associations that have been established by most states  many of which could in turn attempt to return the liability for such claims to insperity 
moreover  in the event of a failure of the carrier providing the epl insurance  insperity may be responsible for the payment of any such claims 
any such events could have a material adverse effect on insperity s financial condition and results of operations 
in  facing continued capital constraints and a series of downgrades from various rating agencies  our former workers compensation insurance carrier for the two year period ending september  lumbermens mutual casualty company  a unit of kemper insurance companies kemper  made the decision to substantially cease underwriting operations and voluntarily entered into run off 
a run off is the professional management of an insurance company s discontinued distressed or nonrenewed lines of insurance and associated liabilities outside of a judicial proceeding 
in the event the run off process is not successful and kemper is forced into receivership or a similar proceeding  most states have established guaranty funds to pay remaining claims 
however  the guaranty associations in some states  including texas  have asserted that state law returns the liability for open claims under such policies to the insured  as we experienced when another former insurance carrier  reliance insurance company reliance  was placed into liquidation in in that case  the texas state guaranty association asserted that it was entitled to full reimbursement from us for workers compensation benefits paid by the association 
although we settled that dispute within the limits of insurance coverage we had secured to cover potential claims returned to us related to the reliance policies  we have no similar insurance coverage for the kemper claims 
if one or more states were to assert that liability for open claims with kemper should be returned to us  we may be required to make a payment to the state covering estimated claims attributable to us 
any such payment would reduce net income  which may have a material adverse effect on net income in the reported period

in conjunction with providing workforce optimization services to clients  we rely on financial institutions to electronically transfer funds for the collection of our comprehensive service fee as well as the payment of worksite employees wages and associated payroll tax withholdings 
failure by these financial institutions  for any reason  to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations  impact client relations  and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 
new and higher state and municipal taxes could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations many states and municipalities in which we operate have experienced economic slowdowns 
this decline in economic activity has resulted in reductions of tax revenues and corresponding budget deficits 
in response to the budget shortfalls  many states and municipalities have increased or enacted new taxes on businesses operating within their tax jurisdiction  including but not limited to  business activity taxes and income taxes 
in addition  many states and municipalities have increased their audit activity in an effort to identify additional tax revenues 
new tax assessments on our operations could result in increased costs 
insperity s ability to adjust its service fees and incorporate additional tax assessments into its billing system could be limited 
as a result  such higher taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
failure to integrate or realize the expected return on our new adjacent business strategy  including acquisitions  could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations we have adopted a strategy to market and sell additional products and services within and outside of the core workforce optimization solution 
as a part of this strategy  periodically we make strategic long term decisions to invest in and or acquire new companies  business units or assets 
new business strategies including the cross selling of adjacent business offerings to workforce optimization clients and the acquisition or development of new businesses involve risk  including those associated with integrating the operations  technologies and personnel 
failure to effectively integrate newly acquired businesses could result in us not achieving anticipated revenues and cost savings 
acquiring new businesses and implementing new selling strategies could also result in the loss of prospective or existing customers  employees or the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
in addition  based on market conditions or changes in operating plans  the fair value of our investments could decline  requiring us to record an impairment charge for all or a portion of the investment 
the failure to effectively implement new selling strategies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  failure to integrate new acquisitions or the occurrence of an impairment  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results

overview our workforce optimization solution provides a broad range of human resources functions  including payroll and employment administration  employee benefits  workers compensation  government compliance  and training and development services 
our long term strategy continues to be aggregating the best small and medium sized businesses in the united states on the common platform of our unique human resources service offering  thereby leveraging our buying power to provide additional valuable services to clients 
our overall operating results can be measured in terms of revenues  payroll costs  gross profit or operating income per worksite employee per month 
we often use the average number of worksite employees paid during a period as our unit of measurement in analyzing and discussing our results of operations 
in addition to workforce optimization  we offer performance management  expense management  time and attendance  organizational planning  recruiting services  employment screening  retirement services and business insurance  collectively adjacent businesses  many of which are offered via desktop applications and software as a service saas delivery models 
these other products or services are offered separately  as a bundle  or along with workforce optimization bundle plus 
we ended averaging  paid worksite employees in the fourth quarter  which represents a increase over the fourth quarter of approximately of our paid worksite employees are in our mid market sector  which is defined as companies with to  worksite employees 
we expect the average number of paid worksite employees per month to be in the range of  to  in the first quarter of our average gross profit per worksite employee per month was  a increase over higher gross profit per worksite employee per month in compared to was primarily the result of a higher contribution from our direct cost programs and a higher contribution from our abus 
operating expenses increased in to million  however  this amount includes approximately million  or per worksite employee per month  associated with our rebranding initiative in on a per worksite employee per month basis  operating expenses increased from in to in our net income in was million  an million increase compared to our net income in was impacted by a million loss related to the exchange of an aircraft and a million loss related to a settlement with the employment development department of the state of california edd in the third quarter of please read note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  for additional information on the edd settlement 
we ended with working capital of million 
during  we paid million in dividends and repurchased shares at a cost of million 
revenues we account for our revenues in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
our workforce optimization gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each worksite employee at the client location and a markup computed as a percentage of each worksite employee s payroll cost 
we invoice the gross billings concurrently with each periodic payroll of our worksite employees 
revenues  which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings  and therefore  consist solely of the markup  are recognized ratably over the payroll period as worksite employees perform their service at the client worksite 
this markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll taxes  benefits and workers compensation costs  plus a separate component related to our hr services 
we include revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced in unbilled accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents our revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled  the resulting number of worksite employees paid each period and the number of worksite employees enrolled in our benefit plans 
because our total markup is computed as a percentage of payroll cost  certain revenues are also affected by the payroll cost of worksite employees  which may fluctuate based on the composition of the worksite employee base  inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies of our markets 
direct costs the primary direct costs associated with our workforce optimization revenue generating activities are employment related taxes payroll taxes costs of employee benefit plans workers compensation costs payroll taxes consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes under fica  federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes 
payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost 
the federal tax rates are defined by federal regulations 
state unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories and vary from state to state 
employee benefits costs are comprised primarily of health insurance premiums and claims costs including dental and pharmacy costs  but also include costs of other employee benefits such as life insurance  vision care  disability insurance  education assistance  adoption assistance  a flexible spending account and a worklife program 
workers compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier  and claims costs  which are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims 
gross profit our gross profit per worksite employee is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to workforce optimization clients  which are subject to contractual arrangements that are typically renewed annually 
we use gross profit per worksite employee per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level 
operating expenses salaries  wages and payroll taxes salaries  wages and payroll taxes are primarily a function of the number of corporate employees and their associated average pay and any additional incentive compensation 
our corporate employees include client services  sales and marketing  benefits  legal  finance  information technology and administrative support personnel 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation primarily relates to the recognition of non cash compensation expense over the vesting period of restricted stock awards 
commissions commission expense consists of amounts paid to sales managers and bpas 
commissions are based on the number of new accounts sold and a percentage of revenue generated by such personnel 
advertising advertising expense primarily consists of media advertising and other business promotions in our current and anticipated sales markets  including the insperity championshiptm presented by unitedhealthcare sponsorship 
in  certain costs incurred as a result of our rebranding initiative are also included in advertising 

table of contents general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses primarily include rent expenses related to our service centers and sales offices outside professional service fees related to legal  consulting and accounting services  and acquisition transaction expenses administrative costs  such as postage  printing and supplies employee travel expenses repairs and maintenance costs rebranding initiative costs depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense is primarily a function of our capital investments in corporate facilities  service centers  sales offices and technology infrastructure 
income taxes insperity s provision for income taxes typically differs from the us statutory rate of  due primarily to state income taxes and non deductible expenses 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include prepaid assets  accruals for workers compensation expenses  stock based compensation and depreciation 
changes in these items are reflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision 
critical accounting policies and estimates insperity s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to health and workers compensation insurance claims experience  client bad debts  income taxes  property and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical and or require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements benefits costs we provide group health insurance coverage to our worksite employees through a national network of carriers including unitedhealthcare united  kaiser permanente  blue shield of california  hmsa bluecross blueshield of hawaii  unity health plan and tufts  all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts 
the health insurance contract with united provides the majority of our health insurance coverage 
as a result of certain contractual terms  we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self funded insurance accounting model 
accordingly  we record the costs of the united plan  including an estimate of the incurred claims  taxes and administrative fees collectively the plan costs  as benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated incurred claims are based upon i the level of claims processed during the quarter  ii estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan  and iii the number of participants in the plan  including both active and cobra enrollees 
each reporting period  changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends  plan design and migration  participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs 
additionally  since the plan s inception  under the terms of the contract  united establishes cash funding rates days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter 
if the plan costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to united  a deficit in the plan would be incurred and we would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our consolidated balance sheets 
on the other hand  if the plan costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid and owed to united  a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums on our consolidated balance sheets 
the terms of the arrangement with united require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of million  which is reported as long term prepaid insurance 
as of december   plan costs were less than the premiums paid and owed to united by million 
as this amount is in excess of the agreed upon million surplus maintenance level  the million balance is included in prepaid insurance  a current asset  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the premiums owed to united at december   were million  which is included in accrued health insurance costs  a current liability  on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents we believe the use of recent claims activity is representative of incurred and paid trends during the reporting period 
the estimated completion rate used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a significant level of judgment 
accordingly  an increase or decrease in the completion rates used to estimate the incurred claims would result in an increase or decrease in benefits costs and net income would decrease or increase accordingly 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rates on our estimate of total benefit costs of million in change in completion rate change in benefits costs in thousands change in net income in thousands workers compensation costs since october   our workers compensation coverage has been provided through our arrangement with the ace group of companies ace 
under our arrangement with ace the ace program  we bear the economic burden for the first million layer of claims per occurrence  and effective october   we also bear the economic burden for a maximum aggregate amount of million per policy year for claim amounts that exceed the first million 
ace bears the economic burden for all claims in excess of these levels 
the ace program is a fully insured policy whereby ace has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities 
our coverage from september  through september  was provided through selected member insurance companies of american international group  inc the aig program 
because we bear the economic burden for claims up to the levels noted above  such claims  which are the primary component of our workers compensation costs  are recorded in the period incurred 
workers compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury 
accordingly  the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates  which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment 
we employ a third party actuary to estimate our loss development rate  which is primarily based upon the nature of worksite employees job responsibilities  the location of worksite employees  the historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims  and an estimate of future cost trends 
each reporting period  changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers compensation claims cost estimates 
during the years ended december  and  insperity reduced accrued workers compensation costs by million and million  respectively  for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods 
workers compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the us treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period the average discount rate utilized in and was and  respectively and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents our claim trends could be greater than or less than our prior estimates  in which case we would revise our claims estimates and record an adjustment to workers compensation costs in the period such determination is made 
if we were to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions  our loss development rates could increase or decrease  which would result in an increase or decrease in workers compensation costs and a resulting decrease or increase in net income reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers compensation costs totaling million in change in loss development rate change in workers compensation costs in thousands change in net income in thousands at the beginning of each policy period  the insurance carrier establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims claim funds 
the level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and expected workers compensation loss rates  as determined by the carrier 
monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one year are recorded as restricted cash  a short term asset  while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits  a long term asset in our consolidated balance sheets 
in  we received million for the return of excess claim funds related to the ace program  which reduced deposits 
as of december   we had restricted cash of million and deposits of million 
we have estimated and accrued million in incurred workers compensation claim costs as of december  our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year are recorded as accrued workers compensation costs and included in short term liabilities  while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year are included in long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
contingent liabilities we accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with asc  contingencies 
gaap requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered probable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated 
for contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably possible to occur  financial statement disclosure is required  including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably determined 
from time to time we disclose in our financial statements issues that we believe are reasonably possible to occur  although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases 
as issues develop  we evaluate the probability of future loss and the potential range of such losses 
if such evaluation were to determine that a loss was probable and the loss could be reasonably estimated  we would be required to accrue our estimated loss  which would reduce net income in the period that such determination was made 
deferred taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could change from our current estimates 
if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period that such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would reduce net income in the period such determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their comprehensive service fees 
we believe that the success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to collect these comprehensive service fees for several reasons  including the fact that we are at risk for the payment of our direct costs and worksite employee payroll costs regardless of whether our clients pay their comprehensive service fees 
table of contents the large volume and dollar amount of transactions we process the periodic and recurring nature of payroll  upon which the comprehensive service fees are based to mitigate this risk  we have established very tight credit policies 
we generally require our workforce optimizationtm clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than one day prior to the applicable payroll date 
in addition  we maintain the right to terminate the csa and associated worksite employees or to require prepayment  letters of credit or other collateral if a client s financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the comprehensive service fee 
as a result of these efforts  losses related to customer nonpayment have historically been low as a percentage of revenues 
however  if our clients financial conditions were to deteriorate rapidly  resulting in nonpayment  our accounts receivable balances could grow and we could be required to provide for additional allowances  which would decrease net income in the period that such determination was made 
property and equipment our property and equipment relate primarily to our facilities and related improvements  furniture and fixtures  computer hardware and software and capitalized software development costs 
these costs are depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
if we determine that the useful lives of these assets will be shorter than we currently estimate  our depreciation and amortization expense could be accelerated  which would decrease net income in the periods of such a determination 
in addition  we periodically evaluate these costs for impairment 
if events or circumstances were to indicate that any of our long lived assets might be impaired  we would assess recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the applicable asset 
in addition  we may record an impairment loss  which would reduce net income  to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeded the fair value of the asset 
fair value is generally determined using an estimate of discounted future net cash flows from operating activities or upon disposal of the asset 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and is written down when impaired 
purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
our purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  three to years 
new accounting pronouncements we believe that we have implemented the accounting pronouncements with a material impact on our financial statements and do not believe there are any new or pending pronouncements that will materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
in september  financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment was issued 
asu provides companies with a new option to determine whether or not it is necessary to apply the traditional two step quantitative goodwill impairment test in asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
under asu companies are no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless it determines  on the basis of qualitative information  that it is more likely than not ie  greater than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
asu is effective for periods ending after december   however  early adoption is permitted for periods ending after september  we adopted asu in the fourth quarter of the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

bonus payroll cost varies from period to period  but has no direct impact to our ultimate workers compensation costs under the current program 
as a result  our management refers to non bonus payroll cost in analyzing  reporting and forecasting our workers compensation costs 
non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we include these non gaap financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to the costs incurred under our current workers compensation program

to meet short term liquidity requirements  which are primarily the payment of direct and operating expenses  we rely primarily on cash from operations 
longer term projects or significant acquisitions may be financed with debt or equity 
we have in the past sought  and may in the future seek  to raise additional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources

table of contents cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities in were million 
our primary source of cash from operations is the comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our workforce optimization clients 
the level of cash and cash equivalents  and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities  are significantly impacted by various external and internal factors  which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts 
these include the following timing of client payments payroll levels we typically collect our comprehensive service fee  along with the client s payroll funding  from clients at least one day prior to the payment of worksite employee payrolls and associated payroll taxes 
therefore  the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of operating cash flows 
for example  many worksite employees are paid on fridays and at month end  therefore  operating cash flows decrease in the reporting periods that end on a friday 
in the year ended december   which the last business day of the reporting period ended on a friday  client prepayments were million and accrued worksite employee payroll was million 
in the year ended december   which also ended on a friday  client prepayments were million and accrued worksite employee payroll was million 
workers compensation plan funding under our workers compensation insurance arrangements  we make monthly payments to the carriers comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims claim funds 
these pre determined amounts are stipulated in our agreements with the carriers  and are based primarily on anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers compensation loss rates during the policy year 
changes in payroll levels from those that were anticipated in the arrangements can result in changes in the amount of the cash payments  which will impact our reporting of operating cash flows 
our claim funds paid  based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers compensation loss rates  were million in and million in however  our estimates of workers compensation loss costs were million and million in and  respectively 
during and  we received million and million  respectively  for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers compensation program  which resulted in an increase to working capital 
medical plan funding our health care contract with united establishes participant cash funding rates days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter 
therefore  changes in the participation level of the united plan have a direct impact on our operating cash flows 
in addition  changes to the funding rates  which are solely determined by united based primarily upon recent claim history and anticipated cost trends  also have a significant impact on our operating cash flows 
since inception of the united plan  premiums paid and owed to united have exceeded plan costs  resulting in a million surplus  million of which is reflected as a current asset  and million of which is reflected as a long term asset on our consolidated balance sheets at december  the premiums owed to united at december   were million  which is included in accrued health insurance costs  a current liability  on our consolidated balance sheets

the cash equivalent short term investments consist primarily of overnight investments  which are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk  except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned on these investments 
the available for sale marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk because these securities generally include a fixed interest rate 
as a result  the market values of these securities are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through diversification and low investment turnover 
our investment policy is designed to maximize after tax interest income while preserving our principal investment 
as a result  our marketable securities consist of tax exempt short and intermediate term debt securities  which are primarily prefunded municipal bonds that are secured by escrow funds containing us government securities
