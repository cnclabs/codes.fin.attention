overview national instruments corporation we  us or our designs  manufactures and sells tools to engineers and scientists that accelerate productivity  innovation and discovery 
our graphical system design approach to engineering provides an integrated software and hardware platform that speeds the development of systems needing measurement and control 
we believe our long term vision and focus on technology supports the success of our customers  employees  suppliers and shareholders 
we sell to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
we have been profitable in every year since no single customer accounted for more than of our sales in or  or of our sales in the key strategies that management focuses on in running our business are the following expanding our broad customer base we strive to increase our already broad customer base by serving a large market on many computer platforms  through a global marketing and distribution network 
we also seek to acquire new technologies and expertise from time to time to open new opportunities for our existing product portfolio 
maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative  modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network 
we strive to maintain a high degree of backwards compatibility across different platforms to preserve the customer s investment in our products 
in this time of intense global competition  we believe it is crucial that we continue to offer products with quality and reliability  and that our products provide cost effective solutions for our customers 
leveraging external and internal technology our product strategy is to provide superior products by leveraging generally available technology  supporting open architectures on multiple platforms and by leveraging our core technologies such as custom application specific integrated circuits asics across multiple products 
we sell into test and measurement t m and industrial embedded applications in a broad range of industries and as such are subject to the economic and industry forces which drive those markets 
it has been our experience that the performance of these industries and our performance is impacted by general trends in industrial production for the global economy and by the specific performance of certain vertical markets that are intensive consumers of measurement technologies 
examples of these markets are semiconductor capital equipment  telecom  defense  aerospace and automotive 
in assessing our business  we consider the trends in the global purchasing managers index pmi published by jp morgan  global industrial production as well as industry reports on the specific vertical industries that we target 
a reading above is indicative of expansion in the global industrial economy 
our business is sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions  both in the us and globally 
historically  our business cycles have generally followed the expansion and contraction cycles in the global industrial economy as measured by the pmi 
the most recent reading for december  showed the pmi had increased to up from readings below for the previous three months  but continues to indicate overall weakness in the global industrial economy 
we are unable to predict whether the industrial economy  as measured by the pmi  will strengthen or contract during if the industrial economy  as measured by the pmi contract or remains at a neutral reading at or around  indicating general weakness  it could have an adverse effect on the spending patterns of businesses including our current and potential customers which could adversely affect our revenues and result of operations 
we distribute our software and hardware products primarily through a direct sales organization 
we also use independent distributors  oems  vars  system integrators and consultants to market our products 
sales through any one of these channels account for less than of our total sales in we have sales offices in the us and sales offices and distributors in key international markets 
sales outside of the americas accounted for approximately of our revenues in  of our revenues in and of our revenues in the vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers local currency  which exposes us to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be derived from international sales 
see 
note segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements for details concerning the geographic breakdown of our net sales  operating income  interest income and long lived assets 
we manufacture a substantial majority of our products at our facilities in debrecen  hungary 
additional production primarily of low volume or newly introduced products is done in austin  texas 
our product manufacturing operations can be divided into four areas electronic circuit card and module assembly  chassis and cable assembly  technical manuals and product support documentation  and software duplication 
we manufacture most of the electronic circuit card assemblies and modules in house  although subcontractors are used from time to time 
we have used a subcontractor in asia to manufacture a significant portion of our chassis but most of that production was moved in house during we manufacture some of our electronic cable assemblies in house  but many assemblies are produced by subcontractors 
we primarily subcontract our software duplication  our technical manuals and product support documentation 
we believe that our long term growth and success depend on delivering high quality software and hardware products on a timely basis 
accordingly  we focus significant efforts on research and development 
we focus our research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and developing new products that incorporate appropriate features and functionality to be competitive with respect to technology  price and performance 
our success also is dependent on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights related to technologies used in our products 
we have engaged in litigation and where necessary  will likely engage in future litigation to protect our intellectual property rights 
in monitoring and policing our intellectual property rights  we have been and may be required to spend significant resources 
our operating results fluctuate from period to period due to changes in global economic conditions and a number of other factors 
as a result  we believe our historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that our net sales will grow or that we will remain profitable in future periods

net sales 
our consolidated net sales were  million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  an increase of in following an increase of in product sales were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  an increase of in following an increase of in software maintenance sales were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  an increase of in following an increase of in during  revenue from our acquisitions was approximately million compared to million in the increase in revenue from our acquisitions in is attributable to the acquisitions of awr corporation and phasematrix which were done in in  products in the areas of graphical system design  which comprised approximately of our revenue  saw a year over year increase of and instrument control products  which comprised approximately of our revenue  saw a year over year increase of 
in  products in the areas of graphical system design which comprised approximately of our revenues saw a year over year increase of  and instrument control products which comprised approximately of our revenues saw a year over year increase of 
revenues from our instrument control products are the most sensitive to the cycles of the global industrial economy 
the revenue increases in and are attributed to increases in sales volume across all regions of our business 
we did not take any significant action with regard to pricing during the years ended december   and large orders  defined as orders with a value greater than  grew by  during following growth of during during  and these large orders were  and  respectively  of our total sales 
larger orders may be more sensitive to changes in the global industrial economy  may be subject to greater discount variability and may contract at a faster pace during an economic downturn 
for the years ended december   and  net sales in the americas were million  million and million  respectively  an increase of in following an increase of in sales in the americas  as a percentage of consolidated sales were  and  respectively  over the three year period

in asia  sales were million  million and million  respectively  an increase of in following an increase of in sales in asia  as a percentage of consolidated sales were  and  respectively  over the three year period 
we anticipate that sales growth in asia may continue to be strong relative to the americas and europe and continue to grow as a percentage of our total net sales 
for the year ended december   net sales in the americas were negatively impacted by the million accrual related to our previous gsa contract 
we expect sales outside of the americas to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations by increasing our presence in existing markets  adding a presence in some new geographical markets and continuing the use of distributors to sell our products in some countries 
almost all of the sales made by our direct sales offices in the americas  outside of the us  in europe and in asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for  in local currency terms  our consolidated sales increased by million or  americas sales increased by million or  european sales increased by million or  and sales in asia pacific increased by million or 
during this same period  the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing our consolidated sales by million or  increasing americas sales by million or  increasing european sales by million or  and increasing sales in asia pacific by million or 
for  in local currency terms  our consolidated sales increased by million or  americas sales increased by million or  european sales increased by million or  and sales in asia pacific increased by million or 
during this same period  the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing our consolidated sales by million or  increasing americas sales by million or  decreasing european sales by million or  and increasing sales in asia pacific by million or 
to help protect against a reduction in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales  we have instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in foreign currencies with forward and purchased option contracts 
during  these hedges had the effect of decreasing our consolidated sales by million 
during  these hedges had the effect of increasing our consolidated sales by million

gross profit 
for the years ended december   and  gross profit was million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit was  and in  and  respectively 
in and  we continued to focus on cost reduction measures throughout our manufacturing cycle and continued to see the benefit of those efforts 
these cost reduction measures will continue to be an area of focus for us in these measures along with robust sales growth have allowed us to achieve and maintain stability in our gross margin percentage 
our gross profit for the year ended december   was negatively impacted by the million accrual related to our previous gsa contract  which reduced our revenue 
during and  the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing our cost of sales by million or and increasing our cost of sales by million or  respectively 
to help protect against changes in our cost of sales caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows  we have a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our forecasted costs of sales denominated in foreign currencies with forward contracts 
during and  these hedges had the effect of decreasing our cost of sales by million and decreasing our cost of sales by million  respectively 
see 
note derivative instruments and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our cash flow hedging program and its related impacted on our consolidated sales for and operating expenses 
for the years ended december   and  operating expenses were million  million and million  respectively  an increase of in  following an increase of in this increase in our operating expenses in was due to higher personnel related expenses of million which included commissions  variable compensation and benefits as well as the fact that temporary cost cutting measures enacted in were still in place in january  higher expenses related to marketing and outside services of million  higher expenses for building  equipment and supplies of million  higher travel related expenses of million  higher equity based compensation of million and higher software development costs of million 
over the same period  the net impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our operating expense by million 
the increase in personnel expenses is related to a net increase in our headcount of employees  including related to our acquisitions 
a large portion of our new hires were recent college graduates 
therefore  we saw the largest expense impact of our hiring during the second half of the increase in our operating expenses in was due to higher personnel related expenses of million which included commissions  variable compensation and benefits 
the increase in personnel expenses is related to a net increase in our overall headcount of employees as well as the termination of temporary cost cutting measures that were put in place during those temporary cost cutting measures reduced our operating expenses by million in in addition  the overall increase in expenses in is attributed to higher travel related expenses of million and higher advertising  tradeshows and other marketing expenses of million 
in addition  the net impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our operating expense by million in for the years ended december   and  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were  and  respectively 
the year over year increase in our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to is attributed to the fact that we grew our overall operating expenses by while our net sales grew by 
for  the decrease in our operating expenses as a percent of sales was due to the fact that we grew our overall operating expense by while our net sales grew by 
we believe that our long term growth and success depends on developing high quality software and hardware products and delivering those products to our customers on a timely basis 
to that end  we made investments in research and development and our field sales force a priority in in  we increased our research and development staff by or and our field sales force by or 
during  we expect to continue our investment in these areas although we expect the rate of growth to decrease 
operating income 
for the years ended december   and  operating income was million  million and million  respectively  a decrease of in  following an increase of in as a percentage of net sales  operating income was  and  respectively  over the three year period 
the decrease in our operating income as a percent of sales during can be attributed to our overall increase in operating expenses of 
the increase in our operating income as a percent of sales during can be attributed to our overall increase in net sales of as well as the increase in our gross profit margin percentage from to 
our operating income for the year ended december   was negatively impacted by the million accrual related to our previous gsa contract  which reduced our revenue 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  a decrease of in  following a decrease of in during  we continued to see low yields for high quality investment alternatives that comply with our corporate investment policy 
we do not expect yields in these types of investments to increase in for  the decrease was attributable to significant decreases in investment yields for high grade treasury  municipal and corporate bonds 
the source of interest income is from the investment of our cash and short term investments 
net foreign exchange gain loss 
net foreign exchange gain loss was million  million  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these results are attributable to movements in the foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in subsidiaries for which our functional currency is not the us dollar 
during the first half of  the us dollar generally declined against most of the major currencies in the markets in which we do business 
during the six month period ended december   we saw the us dollar turn significantly stronger against most of the major currencies in the markets in which we do business 
we cannot predict to what degree or how long this recent volatility in the foreign currency exchange markets will continue 
in the past  we have noted that significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets in which we do business has had a significant impact on the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated firm commitments  on our ability to forecast our us dollar equivalent revenues and expenses and on the effectiveness of our hedging programs 
in the past  these dynamics have also adversely affected our revenue growth in international markets and may pose similar challenges in the future 
we recognize the local currency as the functional currency in virtually all of our international subsidiaries 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated net foreign currency balance sheet positions to help protect against the change in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates 
we typically hedge up to of our outstanding foreign denominated net receivable or payable positions and typically limit the duration of these foreign currency forward contracts to approximately days 
the gain or loss on these derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item net foreign exchange gain loss 
our hedging strategy reduced our foreign exchange losses by  in  increased our foreign exchange losses by million in and reduced our foreign exchange gain by million in provision for income taxes 
for the years ended december   and  our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
the factors that caused our effective tax rate to change in compared to are detailed in the table below years ended december  unaudited effective tax rate for change in valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets recorded during the period increased profits in foreign jurisdictions with reduced income tax rates change in non deductible stock based compensation expense as a percentage of net income enhanced deduction for certain research and development expenses in change in intercompany profit change in research and development tax credits as a percent of net income other effective tax rate for see

the following table presents our working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands december  december  increase decrease working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short investments included in working capital during  our working capital increased by million 
factors contributing to this increase in our working capital were an increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventory of million  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
the increase in our working capital accounts can be attributed to our overall business growth during the year ended december  the change in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is discussed in more detail below under the heading cash provided and used in the years ended december  and our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in numerous financial institutions throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside of the us  however  the majority of our cash and investments that are located outside of the us are denominated in us dollars with the exception of million us dollar equivalent of german government sovereign debt that is denominated in euro 
our german government sovereign debt holdings have a maximum maturity of months and carry aaa aaa ratings 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
approximately million or of these amounts were held in domestic accounts with various financial institutions and million or was held in accounts outside of the us with various financial institutions 
of our short term investments million or is held in our investment accounts in the us and million or is held in investment accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
most of the amounts held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us  but under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us repatriation could result in additional us federal income tax payments in future years 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed 
cash provided and used in the years ended december  and cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  the following table summarizes the proceeds and uses of cash in thousands december  cash provided by operating activities cash used by investing activities cash used by financing activities net decrease increase in cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities was million and million  respectively 
year over year  we saw a decrease in net income of million while cash provided by operating assets and liabilities increased by million 
accounts receivable increased to million at december  compared to million at december  days sales outstanding was days at december   compared to days at december  we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net day payment terms 
if  in the longer term  our revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers  both of which are more likely to occur during challenging economic times when our customers may face issues gaining access to sufficient funding or credit 
consolidated inventory balances increased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns were at december   compared to at december  inventory increased by million during the year ended december   as we took actions to support the growth in our overall business 
the slower growth we saw in the european region during the fourth quarter of also contributed to the overall increase in our inventory 
our inventory levels will continue to be determined based upon our anticipated demand for products and our need to keep sufficient inventory on hand to meet our customers demands 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
rapid changes in customer demand could have a significant impact on our inventory balances in future periods 
investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december   as the result of our acquisitions of awr corporation awr and phase matrix inc pmi for million  net of cash received  and million  net of cash received  respectively  as well as the purchase of property and equipment and other intangibles of million  the capitalization of internally developed software of million  and the net purchase of million of short term investments

financing activities used cash of million during the year ended december   which was the result of million used to pay dividends to our stockholders offset by million received from the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options and under our employee stock purchase plan as well as a tax benefit of million 
for the year ended december   financing activities used million  which was the result of million used to repurchase our common stock and million used to pay dividends to our stockholders  offset by million received as a result of the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options and sales of our common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
from time to time  our board of directors has authorized various programs to repurchase shares of our common stock depending on market conditions and other factors 
under such programs  we repurchased a total of  and  shares of our common stock at weighted average prices of and per share  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
on april   our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program that increased the aggregate number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to repurchase from  to million 
at december   there were  shares remaining available for repurchase under this plan 
this repurchase plan does not have an expiration date 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received less proceeds from the exercise of stock options compared to the year ended december  the timing and number of stock option exercises and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises are not within our control and in the future  we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
moreover  since  it has been our practice to issue restricted stock units and not stock options to eligible employees which will reduce the number of stock options available for exercise in the future 
unlike the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to us 
contractual cash obligations 
the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands total beyond guarantees purchase obligations total commercial commitments we have commitments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office facilities throughout the world 
certain leases require us to pay property taxes  insurance and routine maintenance  and include escalation clauses 
as of december   we had non cancelable operating lease obligations of approximately million compared to million at december  rent expense under operating leases was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
purchase obligations primarily represent purchase commitments for customized inventory and inventory components 
as of december   we had non cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately million over the next twelve months 
at december   we had non cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately million 
at december   we had outstanding guarantees for payment of customs and foreign grants totaling approximately million 
at december   we had outstanding guarantees for payment of customs  foreign grants and potential customer disputes totaling approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any debt or off balance sheet debt 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations as well as from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments  payment of dividends to our stockholders and repurchases of our common stock for at least the next months 
we also believe these sources of cash will be sufficient to fund the construction of our manufacturing  logistics and research and development facility in penang  malaysia  which construction began in the third quarter of and is scheduled to continue through the third quarter of however  we may choose or be required to raise additional funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
historically  we have not had to rely on debt  public or private  to fund our operating  financing or investing activities 
we could also choose or be required to reduce certain expenditures  such as payments of dividends or repurchases of our common stock 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including costs associated with the planned expansion of our manufacturing facilities in malaysia  difficulties and the high tax costs associated with the repatriation of earnings  payment of dividends to our stockholders  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including any volatility in the industrial economy in the various geographic regions in which we do business  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  the timing  cost or outcome of any future intellectual property or commercial disputes including under our previous gsa contract  required levels of research and development and other operating costs  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  repurchases of our common stock  our relationships with suppliers and customers  and  the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
recently issued accounting pronouncements note operations and summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be materially different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale licensing of integrated hardware and software solutions 
independent sales of application software licenses include post contract support services 
in addition  training services are sold separately and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
the products and services are generally sold under standardized licensing and sales arrangements with payment terms ranging from net days in the us to net days and up to net days in some international markets 
approximately of our product license sales include both hardware and software in the customer arrangement  with a small percentage of sales including other services 
we offer rights of return and standard warranties for product defects related to our products 
the rights of return are generally for a period of up to days after the delivery date 
the standard and available extended warranties cover periods ranging from days to three years 
we do not generally enter into contracts requiring product acceptance from the customer 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or services multiple elements 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value as determined by the sales price of each element when sold separately 
when vsoe of fair value is not available for a delivered element but is available for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangement  sales revenue is generally recognized on the date the product is shipped  using the residual method under fasb asc  with a portion of revenue recorded as deferred unearned due to applicable undelivered elements 
undelivered elements for our multiple element arrangements with a customer are generally restricted to post contract support and training and education 
the amount of revenue allocated to these undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those undelivered elements 
deferred revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably over the service period or when the service is completed 
when vsoe of fair value is not available for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangement  sales revenue for the entire sales contract value is generally recognized ratably over the service period of the undelivered element  generally months or when the service is completed in accordance with the subscription method 
deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the application of fasb asc  requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of our earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
on january   we prospectively adopted accounting rules that changed the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the new rules changed the application of the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vsoe if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the adoption of the amended revenue recognition rules did not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
it also did not significantly change how we allocated the arrangement consideration to the various units of accounting or the timing of revenue 
the impact of our adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  estimating allowances for sales returns the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
a provision for estimated sales returns is made by reducing recorded revenue by the amount of the allowance 
accounts receivable is reported net of the allowance for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns was million and million at december  and  respectively 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates or if actual results varied materially from our estimates 
estimating allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and the adjustment for excess and obsolete inventories in addition to estimating an allowance for sales returns  we must also make estimates about the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we also write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million and million at december  and  respectively 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these allowances 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt and inventory obsolescence if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates or if actual results varied materially from our estimates 
accounting for costs of computer software we capitalize costs related to the development and acquisition of certain software products 
capitalization of costs begins when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility for our products is established when the product is available for beta release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
amortization is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and has been recognized based on the product s estimated economic life  generally three years 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized costs are reviewed by management and reduced to net realized value when necessary 
as of december  and unamortized capitalized software development costs were million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other fasb asc  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach based on the market capitalization of the reporting unit 
our annual impairment test was performed as of february  no impairment of goodwill and long lived and intangible assets was identified during and goodwill is deductible for tax purposes in certain jurisdictions 
we have defined our operating segment based on geographic regions 
we sell our products in three geographic regions 
our sales to these regions share similar economic characteristics  similar product mix  similar customers  and similar distribution methods 
accordingly  we have elected to aggregate these three geographic regions into a single operating segment 
as we have one reporting segment  we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and  our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
as of december  and  we had goodwill of approximately million and million  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements using prescribed recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns 
our continuing policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
the tax position of our hungarian operations continue to benefit from assets created by the restructuring of our operations in hungary in in addition  our research and development activities in hungary continue to benefit from a tax law in hungary that provides for an enhanced deduction for qualified research and development expenses 
partial release of the valuation allowance on assets from the restructuring and the enhanced tax deduction for research expenses resulted in income tax benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our earnings in hungary are subject to a statutory tax rate of 
the difference between this rate and the statutory us rate of resulted in income tax benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no countries other than hungary had a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
we have not entered into any advanced pricing or other agreements with the internal revenue service with regard to any foreign jurisdictions 
for additional discussion about our income taxes including components of income before income taxes  our provision for income taxes charged to operations  components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  a reconciliation of income taxes at the us federal statutory rate of to our effective tax rate and other tax matters  see 
note income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
loss contingencies we accrue for probable losses from contingencies including legal defense costs  on an undiscounted basis  when such costs are considered probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable 
we periodically evaluate available information  both internal and external  relative to such contingencies and adjust this accrual as necessary 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management our international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the vast majority of our sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates 
the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing our consolidated sales by million or in  and increasing our consolidated sales by million or in since most of our international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing our consolidated operating expenses by million or in  and increasing our consolidated operating expenses by million or in during the first half of  the us dollar generally declined against most of the major currencies in the markets in which we do business 
during the six month period ended december   we saw the us dollar turn significantly stronger against most of the major currencies in the markets in which we do business 
we cannot predict to what degree or how long this recent volatility in the foreign currency exchange markets will continue 
in the past  we have noted that significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets in which we do business has had a significant impact on the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated firm commitments  on our ability to forecast our us dollar equivalent revenues and expenses and on the effectiveness of our hedging programs 
in the past  these dynamics have also adversely affected our revenue growth in international markets and may pose similar challenges in the future 
we recognize the local currency as the functional currency in virtually all of our international subsidiaries 
if the local currencies in which we sell our products strengthen against the us dollar  we may need to lower our prices in the local currency to remain competitive in our international markets which could have a material adverse effect on our gross and net profit margins 
if the local currencies in which we sell our products weaken against the us dollar and if the local sales prices cannot be raised due to competitive pressures  we will experience a deterioration of our gross and net profit margins 
to help protect against the change in the value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales and expenses over the next one to two years  we have a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our forecasted revenue  cost of sales and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies with foreign currency forward contracts 
for forward contracts  when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the forward contracts designated as hedges 
for purchased option contracts  when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the option contracts designated as hedges  net of the premium paid 
our foreign currency purchased option contracts are purchased at the money or out of the money 
we purchase foreign currency forward and option contracts for up to of our forecasted exposures in selected currencies primarily in euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  korean won and hungarian forint and limit the duration of these contracts to months or less 
as a result  our hedging activities only partially address our risks from foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
we do not invest in contracts for speculative purposes 
during  our hedges had the effect of decreasing our consolidated sales by million  decreasing our cost of sales by million  and decreasing our operating expenses by  during  these hedges had the effect of increasing our consolidated sales by million  decreasing our cost of sales by million  and decreasing our operating expenses by million 
see 
note derivative instruments and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our cash flow hedging program and its related impacted on our consolidated sales  cost of sales and operating expenses for the years ended december  and inventory management the marketplace for our products dictates that many of our products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  we are required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for us due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by us or our competitors of products embodying new technology 
however our risk of obsolescence is mitigated as many of our products have interchangeable parts and many have long lives 
while we adjust for excess and obsolete inventories and we monitor the valuation of our inventories  there can be no assurance that our valuation adjustments will be sufficient 
market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of our investments 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions located in many countries throughout the world 
approximately million or of these amounts were held in domestic accounts with various financial institutions and million or was held in accounts outside of the us with various financial institutions 
at december   million or of our cash and cash equivalents was held in cash in various operating accounts throughout the world  and million or was held in money market accounts and million or was held in us treasuries 
the most significant of our operating accounts was our domestic operating account which held approximately million or of our total cash and cash equivalents at a bank that carried a a aa ratings at december  our short term investment balance is comprised of million or held in our investment accounts in the us and million or held in investment accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
we have million us dollar equivalent of german government sovereign debt that is denominated in euro 
our german government sovereign debt holdings have a maximum maturity of months and carry aaa aaa ratings 
we value our available for sale short term investments based on pricing from third party pricing vendors  who may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level inputs or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly level inputs in determining fair value 
we classify all of our fixed income available for sale securities as having level inputs 
the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of our financial instruments having level inputs were derived from non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data  quoted market prices for similar instruments  or pricing models  such as discounted cash flow techniques 
we believe all of these sources reflect the credit risk associated with each of our available for sale short term investments 
the goal of our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our corporate investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash equivalents and short term investments carried ratings from the major credit rating agencies that were in accordance with our corporate investment policy 
our investment policy allows investments in the following government and federal agency obligations  repurchase agreements repos  certificates of deposit and time deposits  corporate obligations  medium term notes and deposit notes  commercial paper including asset backed commercial paper abcp  puttable bonds  general obligation and revenue bonds  money market funds  taxable commercial paper  corporate notes bonds  municipal notes  municipal obligations  variable rate demand notes and tax exempt commercial paper 
all such instruments must carry minimum ratings of a p f  mig vmig sp and a a a  as applicable  all of which are considered investment grade 
our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months with at least maturing in days or less 
we account for our investments in debt and equity instruments under fasb asc investments debt and equity securities fasb asc 
our investments are classified as available for sale and accordingly are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
investments with maturities beyond one year are classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
the fair value of our short term investments at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the increase was due to the net purchase of million of short term investments which was done to continue the diversification our holdings from money market accounts to debt securities and to take advantage of higher yields associated with longer maturity debt securities 
we follow the guidance provided by fasb asc to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of income 
there were not any other than temporary impairments recognized in other expense during and interest rate risk investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in the fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in our income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  the current interest rate environment of low rates has negatively impacted our investment income 
in order to assess the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on our investment positions as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million increase or decrease in the fair market value of our portfolio 
as of december   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million increase or decrease in the fair market value of our portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity or if there is a other than temporary impairment 
actual future gains and losses associated with our investments may differ from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december   due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and level of interest rates and our actual exposures and positions 
we continue to monitor the stability of the financial markets  particularly those in the european region and have taken steps to limit our direct and indirect exposure to these markets  however  we can give no assurance that we will not be negatively impacted by any adverse outcomes in those markets 
we also continue to weigh the benefit of the higher yields associated with longer maturities against the interest rate risk and credit rating risk  also associated with these longer maturities when making these decisions 
we cannot predict when or if interest rates and investment yields will rise 
if yields continue to stay at these low levels  our investment income will continue to be negatively impacted 
exchange rate risk our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  we utilize purchased foreign currency option and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the euro  british pound  japanese yen  korean won and hungarian forint 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures regularly to help ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchanges rates on our results of operations and financial position 
based on the foreign exchange instruments outstanding at december  and december   an adverse change defined as in the asian currencies and in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in the aggregate settlement value of all of our instruments outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
however  as we utilize foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  we believe that a loss in settlement value for those instruments will be substantially offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure
