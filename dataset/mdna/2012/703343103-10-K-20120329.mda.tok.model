item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we provide an overview of the impact that macroeconomic conditions had on our operations and in the rv  mh  and residential housing industries in we also continued to expand both the breadth and the depth of our products and services through the integration of new and expanded product lines designed to create additional scale advantages 
see strategic acquisitions and expansion below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further details 
patrick had two reportable operating segments in  manufacturing and distribution 
effective january   certain changes were made to the manner in which operating segment results are reported  including certain costs related to wages  payroll taxes and incentive compensation that were previously reflected as unallocated corporate expenses are now being allocated to the company s two operating segments  and a majority of corporate incentive agreements which include vendor rebate agreements previously included in the corporate segment are now being allocated to the operating segments and reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
prior period results were reclassified to reflect the current year presentation 
financial information about these operating segments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
competitive position the rv and mh industries are highly competitive with low barriers to entry 
this level of competition carries through to the suppliers to these industries 
across the company s range of products and services  competition exists primarily on price  product features  quality  and service 
we believe that the quality  service  design and price of our products and the short order turnaround time that we provide allow us to compete favorably in the rv and mh markets 
several competitors compete with us on a regional and local basis 
however  in order for a competitor to compete with us on a national basis  we believe that a substantial capital commitment and investment in personnel would be required 
the other industrial markets in which we continue to expand are also highly competitive 
in and  sales to the rv industry continued to strengthen as evidenced by higher production levels and wholesale unit shipments versus the prior years 
we believe that ongoing credit concerns  slow job growth  swings in consumer confidence levels  and continued lower levels of discretionary spending will all continue to contribute to further volatility in the markets we serve in before a sustained recovery takes hold 
given the environment in the industries in which we operate  the company has identified several operating strategies to maintain or enhance earnings through strategic acquisitions  productivity initiatives  expansion into new product lines  optimization of capacity utilization  and the implementation of a new company wide enterprise resource planning erp software system 

table of contents strategy overview we believe that we have developed quality working relationships with our customers and suppliers  and have oriented our business to the needs of these customers 
these customers include all of the larger rv and mh manufacturers and a number of large to medium sized industrial customers 
our industrial customers generally are directly linked to the residential housing markets 
our rv and mh customers generally demand the lowest competitive prices  high quality standards  short lead times  and a high degree of flexibility from their suppliers 
our industrial customers generally are less price sensitive than our rv and mh customers  and focused on consistent high quality products  exceptional customer service  and quick response time 
in order to best serve our customer base  we have focused our efforts on driving the execution of our organizational strategic agenda osa  embedding our customer first performance oriented culture throughout all levels of the organization  implementing talent development initiatives to ensure we have the resources to meet our customers evolving needs  developing a nationwide manufacturing and distribution presence in response to our customers needs for flexibility and short lead times  and bringing value added products to our customers through the introduction of new products  line extensions  and strategic acquisitions 
additionally  because of the short lead times  which range from hours to same day order receipt and delivery  we have intensified our focus on reducing our inventory levels with the help of some of our key suppliers with vendor managed inventory programs 
these initiatives have been instrumental in improving our operating cash flow and liquidity 
as we explore new markets and industries  we believe that these and other strategic initiatives provide us with a strong foundation for future growth 
in  approximately of our sales were to the rv industry  to the mh industry  and to the industrial and other markets 
in  approximately of our sales were to the rv industry  to the mh industry  and to the industrial and other markets 
the increase in unit shipments in the rv market compared to the softness in the other primary market sectors in which patrick operates  the introduction of new products to the marketplace  and the impact of the acquisitions completed in and  have contributed to an increase in our rv market sales concentration in when compared to prior periods 
operating strategies key operating strategies identified by management  include the following strategic acquisitions and expansion we supply a broad variety of building materials and component products to the rv  mh and industrial markets 
with our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities  we believe that we are well positioned for the introduction of new products to further bring value to our customer base 
in order to facilitate this initiative  we are focused on driving growth through the acquisition of companies with a strategic fit as well as additional product lines  facilities  or other assets to complement or expand our existing businesses 
from january through march  we completed six acquisitions  which directly complement our core competencies and product lines  and introduced over new products and line extensions to the marketplace 
in january  we acquired the cabinet door business of quality hardwoods sales quality hardwoods  our first acquisition following the acquisition of adorn holdings  inc adorn in may in august  we added new products and expanded our rv and mh distribution presence through the acquisition of the wiring  electrical and plumbing products distribution business of blazon international group blazon 
in  we completed three acquisitions that expanded our product offerings to our existing customer base in the rv and industrial market sectors 
in june  we acquired the praxis group praxis  a manufacturer and distributor of high and low gloss painted countertops  foam products  shower doors  electronics and furniture products 
in september  we acquired aia countertops  llc aia  a fabricator of solid surface  granite  and laminated countertops  backsplashes  tables  signs  and other products  and in december  we acquired performance graphics  a designer  producer and installer of exterior graphics for the rv  marine  automotive  racing and enclosed trailer industries 

table of contents in march  we completed the acquisition of d cor manufacturing  llc d cor  which produces laminated and wrapped products for the northwestern us based rv industry 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
strategic divestitures in an effort to strategically align our current operations with businesses within our core competencies  reduce overall fixed costs  and reduce our leverage position  we continue to evaluate alternatives for the divestiture of unprofitable  non core operations 
in  we sold certain assets of our american hardwoods operation and the related operating facility 
in addition  we sold certain assets of our aluminum extrusion operation in july the decision to divest these two operations in was largely based on projected and potential operating losses under the then current operating models and working capital requirements of these operations that led us to assess the overall fit of these operations within the parameters of our strategic plan at that time 
the financial results of these operations are classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
diversification into other markets while we continually seek to improve our position as a leading supplier to the rv and mh industries  we are also seeking to expand our product lines into other industrial  commercial and institutional markets 
many of our products  such as countertops  cabinet doors  laminated panels and mouldings  drawer sides and fronts  slotwall  and shelving  have applications in the kitchen cabinet  household furniture  and architectural markets 
we have a dedicated sales force focused on increasing our industrial market penetration and on our diversification into additional commercial and institutional markets 
we believe that diversification into other industrial markets provides opportunities for improved operating margins with complementary products using current manufacturing processes and applications 
in addition  we believe that our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities have enabled us to be well positioned for new product expansion 
utilization of manufacturing capacity efficiency optimization the decline in volume levels in and due to soft industry conditions in all of the major end markets we serve resulted in unused capacity at almost all of our locations 
we have the ability to increase volumes in almost all of our existing facilities without adding comparable incremental fixed costs 
with the expected continued weak economic conditions in certain parts of the country  we are continually exploring opportunities for further facility consolidation 
however  we have remained committed to certain geographic areas  specifically where there is a larger concentration of mh business and where revenue and cash flow contributions are nominal  due to our commitment to our customer base and to position us in the event of a recovery in the manufactured housing industry 
additionally  we are focused on cross training all of our manufacturing work force in our manufacturing cells within each facility to maximize our efficiencies and increase the flexibility of our labor force 
plant consolidations closures certain manufacturing and distribution operating facilities were either sold or consolidated during and in an effort to improve operating efficiencies in the plants through increased capacity utilization  keep the overhead structure at a level consistent with operating needs  and continue the company s efforts to reduce its leverage during the depressed economic cycle in   and part of  and to facilitate the refinancing of our previous credit facility 
a manufacturing and distribution facility in woodburn  oregon was sold in february for million and the company recorded a pretax gain on sale of approximately million in its first quarter operating results 
the company is currently operating in the same facility under a lease agreement with the purchaser for the use of a portion of the square footage previously occupied 

table of contents the company s manufacturing and distribution facility in fontana  california was sold in march for million and the company recorded a pretax gain on sale of approximately million in its first quarter operating results 
the company is currently operating in the same facility under a lease agreement with the purchaser for the use of a portion of the square footage previously occupied 
in april  we closed our manufacturing division in madisonville  tennessee and consolidated manufacturing operations into the existing owned mt 
joy  pennsylvania manufacturing facility in order to offset a sizable reduction in sales volumes that stemmed from the adoption of a new vertical integration strategy by one of our key manufactured housing customers in tennessee who began to produce and supply its own interior home components 
in october after numerous attempts to increase market penetration in the northwest  we sold the rv and mh business related to our oregon manufacturing division to d cor in order to realign company assets 
we continued to operate a high pressure laminate manufacturing cell for the industrial market and a distribution center for the rv and mh markets in our existing woodburn  oregon location from through february in march  we acquired d cor  immediately expanding our presence in the northwest us based rv industry 
d cor will continue to operate on a stand alone basis in its existing manufacturing facility in tualatin  oregon and we expect to consolidate our oregon manufacturing operations by the end of the third quarter of in  we consolidated the newly acquired countertop manufacturing business of praxis into one of our existing manufacturing facilities in elkhart  indiana that engages in similar activities 
in addition  we consolidated the solid surface operations of one of our existing manufacturing facilities located in elkhart into the larger manufacturing facility acquired with our acquisition of aia 
product development and new product introductions discontinuations with our versatile manufacturing and distribution capabilities  we are continually striving to increase our market presence in all of the markets that we serve and gain entrance into other potential markets 
we remain committed to new product introduction and to new product development initiatives 
new product development is a key component of our strategy to grow our revenue base  keep up with changing market conditions  and proactively address customer demand 
we have a design team that works exclusively with rv and mh manufacturers to meet their creative design and product needs  which includes creating new styles and utilizing new colors  patterns  and wood types for panels and mouldings  cabinet doors and other products 
we plan to continue to devote our time and attention to manufacturing and distribution products that fit within the strategic parameters of our current business model  including appropriate margin and inventory turn levels 
in addition to the new product offerings stemming from acquisitions  we further enhanced our product offerings to our rv  mh and industrial markets customers through the introduction of several new products and the expansion of our existing product lines in on the manufacturing side  we began to manufacture several new cabinet door styles  upgraded cabinetry  new slide out trim  and fabricated backsplashes 
our distribution line was expanded to include new faucets modeled after the residential market  rv gas grills  high quality rv mattresses  recliners  a new convertible sofa bed  additional television lines  new led lighting products  a close up poly wrap product for housing  a new vinyl siding product  and a line of wall mounted stereos 
in  we discontinued certain distribution product lines including our line of adhesives  vapor barriers  paints and house wrap 
principal products through our manufacturing divisions  we manufacture and fabricate a variety of products  such as decorative vinyl and paper panels  solid surface  granite  laminated and painted countertops  wrapped profile mouldings  stiles and battens  hardwood  foil and membrane pressed cabinet doors  drawer sides and bottoms  interior passage doors  and slotwall and slotwall components 
in conjunction with our manufacturing capabilities  we also provide value added processes  including custom fabrication  edge banding  drilling  boring  and cut to size capabilities 

table of contents we distribute pre finished wall and ceiling panels  drywall and drywall finishing products  electronics  wiring  electrical and plumbing products  cement siding  interior passage doors  roofing products  laminate flooring  and other miscellaneous products 
manufactured laminated panels and hardwood doors contributed and  respectively  of total manufacturing segment sales 
the wiring  electrical and plumbing products division and the electronics division within our distribution segment contributed and  respectively  of total sales in this segment in we have no material patents  licenses  franchises  or concessions and do not conduct significant research and development activities 
manufacturing processes and operations our primary manufacturing facilities utilize various materials such as lauan  mdf  gypsum and particleboard  which are bonded by adhesives or a heating process to a number of products  including vinyl  paper  foil and high pressure laminate 
additionally  we offer high pressure laminate bonded to substrates  such as particleboard and lauan which has many uses  including countertops and cabinetry 
we manufacture and fabricate solid surface  granite  and high pressure laminate countertops for all of our primary markets  as well as slotwall and slotwall components for the retail store fixture markets 
roll laminated products are used in the production of wall  cabinet  shelving  counter and fixture products with a wide variety of finishes and textures 
we manufacture three distinct cabinet door product lines in both raised and flat panel designs  as well as square  shaker style  cathedral and arched panels 
one product line is manufactured from raw lumber using solid oak  maple  cherry and other hardwood materials  and comes in a variety of finishes and glazes 
another line of doors is made of laminated fiberboard  and a third line uses membrane press technology to produce doors and components with vinyls ranging from mil to mil in thickness 
several outside profiles include square  shaker style  cathedral  and arched raised panel doors and the components include rosettes  hardwood moulding  arched window trim  blocks and windowsills  among others 
our doors are sold mainly to the rv and mh industries 
we also market to the cabinet manufacturers and ready to assemble furniture manufacturers 
our vinyl printing facility produces a wide variety of decorative vinyls which are mil in thickness and are shipped in rolls ranging from yards in length 
this facility produces material for both internal use by patrick and sale to external customers 
markets we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the rv and mh industries  and in other industrial markets 
while the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future course of the economy and fluctuating market conditions have had an impact on business conditions in our three primary markets  we have seen a recovery in the rv and certain other markets 
in and  sales to the rv industry improved as evidenced by higher production levels and wholesale unit shipments versus the prior year periods 
we believe that ongoing credit concerns  slow job growth  swings in consumer confidence levels  and continued lower levels of discretionary spending will all continue to contribute to further volatility in the markets we serve in before a sustained recovery takes hold 
recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases  and therefore  any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income can have a negative impact on these markets 
the mh industry continues to be negatively impacted by financing concerns and a lack of available financing sources  and the current credit situation in the residential housing market puts additional pressure on consumers  who are generally using financial institutions and conventional financing as a source for these purchases 
approximately of our industrial revenue base in was associated with the us residential housing market  and therefore  there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing production 
in order to offset some of the impacts of the residential housing market declines  we have focused on diversification and have targeted certain sales efforts towards market segments that are less directly tied to new home construction 
table of contents demand  including the retail fixture  furniture  and countertop markets 
as a result  we have seen a shift in our product mix which has had a positive impact on revenues from the industrial markets 
we remain cautious about short term growth in the industrial sector due to restricted credit conditions and current uncertainty related to general economic conditions and the large number of repossessed homes in the marketplace 
in the long term  we believe residential housing growth will be based on job growth  the availability of credit  affordable interest rates  and continuing government incentives to stimulate housing demand and reduce surplus inventory due to foreclosures 
recreational vehicles the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing general economic conditions which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
we believe that fluctuations in interest rates  consumer confidence  the level of disposable income  and equity securities market trends have an impact on rv sales 
over the past three years  however  we have noticed a level of resilience in the rv marketplace where rv buyers appear to have prioritized the purchase of a unit over other items in an effort to pursue their desired lifestyle 
while concerns about the availability and price of gasoline can have an impact on rv demand  market trends also indicate that the average rv owner travels less distance but with similar frequency than during periods of lower gas prices and greater availability 
demographic and ownership trends continue to point to favorable market growth in the long term  as the number of baby boomers reaching retirement is steadily increasing  products such as sports utility rvs and toy haulers with a rear section to store and transport motorcycles  snowmobiles  atvs and other leisure products are attractive to younger buyers  and rv manufacturers are also providing an array of product choices  including producing lightweight towables and smaller  fuel efficient motorhomes 
green technologies  such as lightweight composite materials  solar panels  and energy efficient components are appearing on an increasing number of rvs 
in addition  federal economic credit and stimulus packages that contain provisions to stimulate rv lending and provide favorable tax treatment for new rv purchases may help promote sales and aid in the rv industry s continued economic recovery 
recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the recreational vehicle industry association rvia 
the principal types of recreational vehicles include conventional travel trailers  folding camping trailers  fifth wheel trailers  motor homes  and conversion vehicles 
these recreational vehicles are distinct from mobile homes  which are manufactured houses designed for permanent and semi permanent residential dwelling 
conventional travel trailers and folding camping trailers are non motorized vehicles designed to be towed by passenger automobiles  sport utility vehicles  crossover vehicles  pick up trucks or vans 
they provide comfortable  self contained living facilities for short periods of time 
conventional travel trailers and folding camping trailers are towed by means of a frame hitch attached to the towing vehicle 
fifth wheel trailers  designed to be towed by heavy duty pick up trucks  are constructed with a raised forward section that is attached to the bed area of the pick up truck 
this allows for a bi level floor plan and more living space than a conventional travel trailer 
a motor home is a self powered vehicle built on a motor vehicle chassis 
the interior typically includes a driver s area  kitchen  bathroom  shower  dining  and sleeping areas 
motor homes are self contained with their own lighting  heating  cooking  refrigeration  sewage holding  and water storage facilities 
although they are not designed for permanent or semi permanent living  motor homes do provide comfortable living facilities for short periods of time 
sales of recreational vehicle products have been cyclical 
shortages of motor vehicle fuels and significant increases in fuel prices have had a material adverse effect on the market for recreational vehicles in the past  and could adversely affect demand in the future 
the rv industry is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to dealers and retail purchasers 
substantial increases in interest rates and decreases in the general availability of credit have had a negative impact upon the industry in the past and may do so in the future 
recession and lack of consumer confidence generally result in a decrease in the sale of leisure time products such as recreational vehicles 
the period beginning in and continuing through resulted in seven out of eight years with industry wide wholesale shipment levels of rvs over  units primarily due to the favorable demographic trend of the aging 
table of contents baby boomer population  improved consumer confidence  lower interest rates  and a fear of flying after the september  terrorist attacks 
in  shipment levels declined approximately to  units  reflecting tight credit conditions  declining consumer confidence  reduced disposable income levels  and the generally depressed economic environment 
in  shipment levels declined an additional to  units reflecting low consumer confidence and the continuance of unfavorable market conditions experienced by the industry in however  production levels in the rv industry were stronger than expected in the latter half of based on a higher demand for rvs by retail dealers 
in  the rv industry continued to strengthen as shipment levels increased from reaching  units 
shipment levels increased in to  units compared to despite these increases  wholesale unit shipments of rvs in were still lower than the average shipment levels during the period and lower than the three year period from in  the original equipment manufacturers oems moved more toward less costly raw material products  driven in part by the significant price increases on commodity products during the rvia expects the recovery to strengthen as credit availability  job security and consumer confidence improve 
the rvia is currently forecasting a increase in wholesale unit shipments compared to the level 
the company estimates that approximately of its revenues related to the rv industry are derived from the towables sector of the market  which is consistent with the overall rv production mix 
the towable units are lighter and less expensive than standard gas or diesel powered motorized units  representing a more attractive solution for the cost conscious buyer 
from to  motorized unit shipments declined approximately and towable unit shipments rose approximately 
we believe that we are well positioned with respect to our product mix within the rv industry to take advantage of any improved market conditions 
the following chart reflects the historical wholesale unit shipment levels in the rv industry from through per rvia statistics manufactured housing manufactured homes traditionally have been one of the principal means for first time homebuyers to overcome the obstacles of large down payments and higher monthly mortgage payments due to the relatively lower cost of construction as compared to site built homes 
manufactured housing also presents an affordable alternative to site built homes for retirees and others desiring a lifestyle in which home ownership is less burdensome than in the case of site built homes 
the increase in square footage of living space and updated modern designs in manufactured homes created by multi sectional models have made them a viable alternative to a larger segment of homebuyers 

table of contents manufactured homes are constructed to the building standards of the us department of housing and urban development hud and are factory built and transported to a site where they are installed  often permanently 
some manufactured homes have design limitations imposed by the constraints of efficient production and over the road transit 
delivery expense limits the effective competitive shipping range of the manufactured homes to approximately to miles 
modular homes  which are built in accordance with state and local building codes  are factory built homes that are built in sections and transported to the site for installation 
these homes are generally set on a foundation and are subject to land home financing terms and conditions 
in recent years  these units have been gaining in popularity due to their aesthetic similarity to site built homes and their relatively less expensive cost 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and is affected by the availability of alternative housing  such as apartments  town houses  condominiums and site built housing  including repossessed residential housing inventory levels 
from to  industry wide wholesale unit shipments of manufactured homes declined 
the level of  wholesale units was at the lowest level in the last years 
mh unit shipments rose in and in manufactured housing has been negatively impacted by the continued weakness in the overall housing market and limited credit availability  as well as the high credit standards applied to purchases of manufactured homes  high down payment requirements and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site built homes and loans for manufactured homes 
we believe the mh industry may begin to experience a modest recovery when the economy improves and home buyers begin to look for affordable housing 
however  due to the current real estate and economic environment  fluctuating consumer confidence  differences in interest rate spreads for site built homes and manufactured homes  and the current retail and wholesale credit market  the company currently projects that industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes will remain low by historical standards until these conditions improve 
factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry in the future include quality credit standards in the residential housing market  job growth  favorable changes in financing laws  new tax credits for new home buyers and other government incentives  and higher interest rates on traditional residential housing loans 
we believe the factors responsible for the past decade plus decline include lack of available financing and access to the asset backed securities markets  high vacancy rates in apartments  high levels of repossessed housing inventories  over built housing markets in certain regions of the country that resulted in fewer sales of new manufactured homes  as well as the generally depressed economic environment 
additionally  low conventional mortgage rates and less restrictive lending terms for residential site built housing over much of this period contributed to the decline as manufactured home loans generally carry a higher interest rate and less competitive terms 
the mh industry has also had to contend with credit requirements that became more stringent  and a reduction in availability of lenders for manufactured homes for both retailers and dealers 
many of the causes of the recent residential housing crisis are similar to the factors that resulted in the decline in the mh industry beginning in late while there is demand for permanent rebuilding in areas damaged by catastrophic events in recent years  credit conditions remain adverse especially as a result of the recent credit crisis  and current overall economic conditions are unfavorable in relation to the factors which will promote positive growth 
the availability of financing and access to the asset backed securities market is still restricted  and we believe that employment growth and standard quality oriented lending practices in the conventional site built housing markets are needed to enable more balanced demand  thus resulting in the potential for increased production and shipment levels in the mh industry 
the following chart reflects the historical wholesale unit shipment levels in the mh industry from through per the manufactured housing institute 
table of contents other markets many of our core manufacturing products  including paper vinyl laminated panels  shelving  drawer sides  high pressure laminated panels  and solid surface and granite countertops are utilized in the kitchen cabinet  store fixture and commercial furnishings  and residential furniture markets 
these markets are generally categorized by a more performance than price driven customer base  and provide an opportunity for us to diversify our clientele  while providing increased contribution to our core laminating and fabricating competencies 
while the residential furniture markets have been severely impacted by import pressures  other segments have been less vulnerable  and therefore provide opportunities for increased sales penetration and market share gains 
while demand for our products in the residential housing market has been adversely impacted by the severe housing downturn  long term growth in the residential housing market will be based on job growth  the availability of credit  continued affordable interest rates  and government incentives to stimulate housing demand and reduce surplus inventory due to foreclosures  which we believe will ultimately increase the demand for our products 
industrial demand tends to lag the housing cycle by six to twelve months and will vary based on differences in regional economic prospects 
as a result  we believe continued focus on the industrial markets will help mitigate the impact of the cyclical patterns in the rv mh markets on our operating results 
we have the available capacity to increase industrial revenue and benefit from the diversity of multiple market segments  unique regional economies and varied customer strategies 
marketing and distribution our sales are to recreational vehicle and manufactured housing manufacturers and other industrial products manufacturers 
we have approximately active customers 
we have five customers  who together accounted for approximately and of our consolidated net sales in and  respectively 
the company had one rv customer that accounted for approximately  and of consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and in addition  sales to a different rv customer accounted for approximately  and of consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
in addition  in  sales to a manufactured housing customer accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales of the company 
a majority of products for distribution are generally purchased in carload or truckload quantities  warehoused  and then sold and delivered by us 
in addition  approximately and of our distribution segment s products were shipped directly from the suppliers to our customers in and  respectively 
we typically experience a one to two week delay between issuing our purchase orders and the delivery of products to our warehouses or customers 
as lead times have declined over the years  in some instances  certain customers have required same day or next day service 
we generally keep backup supplies of various commodity products in our warehouses to ensure that we have product on hand at all times for our distribution customers 
our customers do not maintain long term supply 
table of contents contracts  and therefore we must bear the risk of accurate advanced estimation of customer orders 
in periods of declining market conditions  customer order rates can decline  resulting in less efficient logistics planning and fulfillment and thus increasing delivery costs due to increased numbers of shipments with less product in each shipment 
we have no significant backlog of orders 
with the recent acquisition of d cor in  we now operate warehouse and distribution centers and manufacturing operations located in alabama  arizona  california  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  minnesota  oregon  pennsylvania  tennessee and texas 
by using these facilities  we are able to minimize our in transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing plants of our customers 
patrick does not engage in significant marketing efforts nor does it incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures other than attendance at certain trade shows and the activities of its sales personnel and the maintenance of customer relationships through price  quality of its products  service and customer satisfaction 
in our design showroom located in elkhart  indiana  many of our manufactured and distribution products are on display for current and potential customers  their design and purchasing staff  and other key product managers and designers 
we believe the design showroom has provided patrick with the opportunity to grow its market share by educating our customers regarding the style and content options that we have available and by offering in house custom design services to further differentiate our product lines 
in addition  we recently redesigned our company website  www 
patrickind 
com  to expand our internet presence and further showcase our primary product brands to both existing and potential customers 
suppliers during the year ended december   we purchased approximately of our raw materials and distributed products from twenty different suppliers 
the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately of our purchases 
our current major material suppliers with contracts through december   include united states gypsum  mjb wood group and tumac lumber company 
we have terms and conditions with these and other suppliers that specify exclusivity in certain areas  pricing structures  rebate agreements and other parameters 
materials are primarily commodity products  such as lauan  gypsum  particleboard  and other lumber products  which are available from many suppliers 
we maintain a long term supply agreement with one of our major suppliers of materials to the mh industry 
our sales in the short term could be negatively impacted in the event any unforeseen negative circumstances were to affect our major supplier 
we believe that we have a good relationship with this supplier and all of our other suppliers 
alternate sources of supply are available for all of our major material purchases 
regulation and environmental quality the company s operations are subject to certain federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during their manufacturing processes 
over the past several years  patrick has taken a proactive role in certifying that the composite wood substrate materials that it uses to produce products for its customers in the rv marketplace have complied with applicable emission standards developed by the california air resources board carb 
all suppliers and manufacturers of composite wood materials are required to comply with the current carb regulations 
we believe that we are currently operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and have made reports and submitted information as required 
the company believes that the expense of compliance with these laws and regulations with respect to environmental quality  as currently in effect  will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or competitive position  and will not require any material capital expenditures for plant or equipment modifications which would adversely affect earnings 
seasonality manufacturing operations in the rv and mh industries historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the climate is moderate 
accordingly  the company s sales and profits were generally highest in the second and third quarters 
however  current seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years  primarily 
table of contents due to fluctuations in rv dealer inventories and volatile economic conditions 
over the past three years  the seasonality cycle in the rv industry has changed as a result of rv dealer shows being held in the september october timeframe by the two largest oem s in the industry 
employees as of december   we had employees  of which were engaged directly in production  warehousing  and delivery operations  in sales  and in office and administrative activities which includes purchasing  inventory and production control  customer service  human resources  accounting  and information technology  among others 
there were no manufacturing plants or distribution centers covered by collective bargaining agreements

these risks include  but are not limited to  the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on form k 
all of these risks should be carefully considered 
our results of operations have been  and may continue to be  adversely impacted by the effects of the worldwide macroeconomic downturn in and part of  and recent concerns over the sustainability of the economic recovery 
in and part of  general worldwide economic conditions continued to experience a downturn due to the effects of the deterioration in the residential housing market  subprime lending crisis  general credit market crisis  collateral effects on the finance and banking industries  increased commodity costs  volatile energy costs  concerns about inflation  slower economic activity  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns the economic crisis 
these conditions adversely affected demand in the three major end markets we serve the rv  mh and industrial markets in resulting in decreased sales of our component products into these markets 
although economic conditions improved somewhat in and in and  as a result our sales  operating income  and cash flows improved when compared to  a further deterioration in these conditions could negatively affect our operations and result in lower sales  income  and cash flows in the future 
in addition  it is still difficult at times for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if our business conditions warrant  we may be forced to close and or consolidate certain of our operating facilities  sell assets  and or reduce our workforce  which may result in our incurring restructuring charges 
we cannot predict the duration of an economic downturn  the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery or the extent to which an economic downturn will continue to negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the continuing depressed conditions in the residential housing market have had an adverse impact on our operations in recent years and could have an adverse impact on our operations in and other future periods 
the residential housing market has experienced overall declines and is expected to remain at depressed levels by historical standards at least through  despite recent and forecasted improvements 
approximately of our industrial revenue in was directly tied to the residential housing market 
in addition  a significant portion of our other industrial revenue and substantially all of our mh revenue is directly or indirectly influenced by conditions in the residential housing market 
the decline in demand for residential housing  ongoing credit concerns and the tightening of consumer credit have lowered demand for our industrial and mh products and have had an adverse impact on our operations as a whole 
in addition  the impact of the sub prime mortgage crisis and housing downturn on consumer confidence  discretionary spending  and general economic conditions has decreased and may continue to decrease demand for our products sold to the rv industry 
we may incur significant charges or be adversely impacted by the consolidation and or closure of all or part of a manufacturing or distribution facility 
we periodically assess the cost structure of our operating facilities to distribute and or manufacture and sell our products in the most efficient manner 
our manufacturing and distribution facilities in woodburn  oregon and fontana  california were sold in and we are currently operating in the same facilities under a lease agreement 
table of contents with the purchasers for the use of a portion of the square footage previously occupied 
we also incurred charges in related to downsizing our operations in the california facility and to accommodate the use of this facility by two different parties 
in addition  in april  we closed our manufacturing division in madisonville  tennessee and consolidated operations into the existing owned mt 
joy  pennsylvania manufacturing facility in order to offset a sizable reduction in sales volumes that stemmed from the adoption of a new vertical integration strategy by one of our key manufactured housing customers in tennessee who began to produce and supply its own interior home components 
in  we consolidated of the newly acquired countertop manufacturing business of praxis into one of our existing manufacturing facilities in elkhart  indiana that engages in similar activities 
in addition  we consolidated the solid surface operations of one of our existing manufacturing facilities located in elkhart into the larger manufacturing facility acquired with our acquisition of aia 
based on our assessments and if required by business conditions  we may make capital investments to move  discontinue manufacturing and or distribution capabilities  sell or close all or part of additional manufacturing and or distribution facilities in the future 
these changes could result in significant future charges or disruptions in our operations  and we may not achieve the expected benefits from these changes which could result in an adverse impact on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the financial condition of our customers and suppliers may deteriorate as a result of the current economic environment and competitive conditions in their markets 
the continued effects of the recent economic crisis may lead to increased levels of restructurings  bankruptcies  liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers  suppliers and other service providers and financial institutions with whom we do business 
such events could  in turn  negatively affect our business either through loss of sales or inability to meet our commitments or inability to meet them without excess expense because of loss of suppliers or other providers 
in addition  several of our customers have undergone unprecedented financial distress which may result in such customers undergoing major restructuring  reorganization or other significant changes 
the occurrence of any such event could have further adverse consequences to our business including a decrease in demand for our products 
if such customers become insolvent or file for bankruptcy  our ability to recover accounts receivables from those customers would be adversely affected and any payments we received in the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially recoverable by the bankruptcy trustee 
many of our customers participate in highly competitive markets  and their financial condition may deteriorate as a result 
a decline in the financial condition of our customers could hinder our ability to collect amounts owed by customers 
in addition  such a decline could result in lower demand for our products and services 
although we have a large number of customers  a limited number of customers account for a significant percentage of the company s sales and the loss of one or several significant customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we have a number of customers that account for a significant percentage of our net sales 
specifically  two customers in the rv market accounted for a combined of consolidated net sales in the loss of any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we do not have long term agreements with customers and cannot predict that we will maintain our current relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply them at current levels 
a significant percentage of the company s sales are concentrated in the rv industry  and declines in the level of rv unit shipments  or reductions in industry growth  could adversely impact our sales levels to this industry and our operating results 
in  of our net sales were to the rv industry versus in and in the increase in the company s sales concentration in the rv industry primarily resulted from the recovery in rv wholesale unit shipment levels beginning in late  increased rv market penetration by the company and the company s successful completion of several rv related acquisitions in and future declines in rv unit shipment levels or 
table of contents reductions in industry growth could significantly reduce the company s revenue from the rv industry and have a material adverse impact on our operating results in and other future periods 
the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries are highly competitive and some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do 
we operate in a highly competitive business environment and our sales could be negatively impacted by our inability to maintain or increase prices  changes in geographic or product mix  or the decision of our customers to purchase our competitors products instead of our products or to produce in house products that we currently produce 
we compete not only with other suppliers to the rv and mh producers but also with suppliers to traditional site built homebuilders and suppliers of cabinetry and flooring 
sales could also be affected by pricing  purchasing  financing  advertising  operational  promotional  or other decisions made by purchasers of our products 
additionally  we cannot control the decisions made by suppliers of our distributed and manufactured products and therefore  our ability to maintain our exclusive and non exclusive distributor contracts and agreements may be adversely impacted 
the greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions 
certain competitors may also have the ability to develop innovative new products that could put the company at a competitive disadvantage 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers and suppliers to the rv and mh industries  we could lose customers and sales could decline  or we will not be able to improve or maintain profit margins on sales to customers or be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets 
seasonality and cyclical economic conditions affect the rv and mh markets the company serves 
the rv and mh markets are cyclical and dependent upon various factors  including the general level of economic activity  consumer confidence  interest rates  access to financing  inventory and production levels  and the cost and availability of fuel 
economic and demographic factors can cause substantial fluctuations in production  which in turn impact sales and operating results 
demand for recreational vehicles and manufactured housing generally declines during the winter season 
our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items 
consequently  the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period 
the cyclical nature of the domestic housing market has caused our sales and operating results to fluctuate 
these fluctuations may continue in the future  which could result in operating losses during downturns 
the us housing industry is cyclical and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors  including terms and availability of financing for homebuyers and retailers  overall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending  interest rates  population and employment trends  income levels  housing demand  and general economic conditions  including inflation  deflation and recessions 
the rv and mh industries and the industrial markets can be affected by the fluctuations in the residential housing market 
as a result of the foregoing factors  our sales and operating results can fluctuate  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
moreover  cyclical and seasonal downturns in the residential housing market may cause us to experience operating losses 
fuel shortages or high prices for fuel have had  and could continue to have  an adverse impact on our operations 
the products produced by the rv industry typically require gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation  or the use of a vehicle requiring gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation 
there can be no assurance that the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel will continue uninterrupted or that the price or tax on fuel will not significantly increase in the future 
shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel have had a significant adverse effect on the demand for recreational vehicles in the past and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on demand in the future 
rapid significant increases 
table of contents in fuel prices  as we experienced in recent years and are currently experiencing  appear to affect the demand for recreational vehicles when gasoline prices reach unusually high levels 
such a reduction in overall demand for recreational vehicles could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
approximately and of our sales were to the rv industry for and  respectively 
we are dependent on third party suppliers and manufacturers 
generally  our raw materials  supplies and energy requirements are obtained from various sources and in the quantities desired 
while alternative sources are available  our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery 
fluctuations in the prices of these requirements may be driven by the supply demand relationship for that commodity  governmental regulation  economic conditions in other countries  religious holidays  natural disasters  and other events 
in addition  if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated  the availability or price of these requirements could be adversely affected 
the increased cost and limited availability of raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
prices of certain materials  including gypsum  lauan  particleboard  mdf  and other commodity products  can be volatile and change dramatically with changes in supply and demand 
certain products are purchased from overseas and are dependent upon climate changes  seasonal and religious holidays  political unrest  economic conditions overseas  natural disasters  vessel shipping schedules and port availability 
further  certain of our commodity product suppliers sometimes operate at or near capacity  resulting in some products having the potential of being put on allocation 
we generally have been able to maintain adequate supplies of materials and to pass higher material costs on to our customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases where needed 
however  it is not certain future price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities 
the recent credit crisis and its continuing impact on the financial and housing markets may also impact our suppliers and affect the availability or pricing of materials 
our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items 
we are subject to governmental and environmental regulations  and failure in our compliance efforts or events beyond our control could result in damages  expenses or liabilities that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing businesses are subject to various governmental and environmental regulations 
implementation of new regulations or amendments to existing regulations could significantly increase the cost of the company s products 
certain components of manufactured and modular homes are subject to regulation by the us consumer product safety commission 
we currently use materials that we believe comply with government regulations 
we cannot presently determine what  if any  legislation may be adopted by congress or state or local governing bodies  or the effect any such legislation may have on us or the mh industry 
in addition  failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines or potential civil or criminal liability 
both scenarios could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition 
the inability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and key personnel may adversely affect our operations 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could reduce our ability to manage our business and strategic plan in the short term and could cause our sales and operating results to decline 
in addition  our future success will depend on  among other factors  our ability to attract and retain executive management  key employees and other qualified personnel 
our ability to integrate acquired businesses may adversely affect operations 
as part of our business and strategic plan  we look for strategic acquisitions to provide shareholder value 
any acquisition will require the effective integration of an existing business and its administrative  financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing and other functions to maximize synergies 
acquired businesses involve a number of risks that may affect our financial performance  including increased leverage  diversion of management resources  assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses  and possible corporate culture conflicts 
if we are unable to successfully integrate these acquisitions  we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process  and 
table of contents our financial results may be negatively impacted 
additionally  significant unexpected liabilities could arise from these acquisitions 
increased levels of indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
on march   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo capital finance  llc as the lender and agent  to establish a four year million revolving secured senior credit facility the credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately million of total debt outstanding under our credit facility  million aggregate principal amount of our secured senior subordinated notes outstanding and million of our subordinated secured promissory note issued to the seller of our recent acquisition of aia 
indebtedness could have adverse consequences on our future operations  including i making it more difficult for us to meet our payments on outstanding debt  ii an event of default  if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement and other indebtedness that we have  which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable  iii reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  iv limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  v placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged  and vi creating concerns about our credit quality which could result in the loss of supplier contracts and or customers 
our credit agreement and our secured senior subordinated notes contain various financial performance and other covenants 
if we do not remain in compliance with these covenants  our credit agreement could be terminated and the amounts outstanding thereunder and the secured senior subordinated notes could become immediately due and payable 
we have debt outstanding that contains financial and non financial covenants with which we must comply that place restrictions on us 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement or our secured senior subordinated notes 
these covenants require that we attain minimum levels of a fixed charge coverage ratio and excess availability under the credit facility  and adhere to annual capital expenditure limitations as defined by our credit agreement 
if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement or our secured senior subordinated notes  the lenders could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in our having to refinance the indebtedness under unfavorable terms 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full and there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
industry conditions and our operating results have limited our sources of capital in the past 
if we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed  we may be unable to maintain or expand our business 
we depend on our cash balances  our cash flows from operations  and our credit facility to finance our operating requirements  capital expenditures and other needs 
if the general economic conditions that prevailed in and part of should return in the future  production of rvs and manufactured homes could decline  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
a decline in our operating results could negatively impact our liquidity 
if our cash balances  cash flows from operations  and availability under our credit facility are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available  we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions  or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations 
we have letters of credit representing collateral for our casualty insurance programs and for general operating purposes 
the letters of credit are issued under our credit agreement 
the inability to retain our current letters of credit  to obtain alternative letter of credit sources  or to retain our credit agreement to support these programs could require us to post cash collateral  reduce the amount of cash available for our operations  or cause us to curtail or limit existing operations 
increased levels of inventory may adversely affect our profitability 
our customers generally do not maintain long term supply contracts and  therefore  we must bear the risk of advanced estimation of customer orders 
we maintain an inventory to support these customers needs 
changes in 
table of contents demand  market conditions and or product specifications could result in material obsolescence and a lack of alternative markets for certain of our customer specific products and could negatively impact operating results 
we could incur charges for impairment of assets  including goodwill and other long lived assets  due to potential declines in the fair value of those assets or a decline in expected profitability of the company or individual reporting units of the company 
a portion of our total assets as of december  was comprised of goodwill  amortizable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment 
under generally accepted accounting principles  each of these assets is subject to periodic review and testing to determine whether the asset is recoverable or realizable 
the events or changes that could require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment include a changes in our estimated future cash flows  changes in rates of growth in our industry or in any of our reporting units  and decreases in our stock price and market capitalization 
in the future  if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  asset write downs may be required 
significant impairment charges  although not always affecting current cash flow  could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
a variety of factors could influence fluctuations in the market price for our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future in response to a number of factors  including those discussed below 
the market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate 
some of the factors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate include variations in our and our competitors operating results  historically low trading volume  high concentration of shares held by institutional investors and in particular our majority shareholder  tontine capital partners  lp and affiliates collectively  tontine capital  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  the gain or loss of significant customers  additions or departure of key personnel  events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us  general conditions in industries in which we operate  general conditions in the united states and abroad  the presence or absence of short selling of our common stock  future sales of our common stock or debt securities  announcements by us or our competitors of technological improvements or new products  and the sale by tontine capital or its announcement of an intention to sell  all or a portion of its equity interests in the company 
fluctuations in the stock market may have an adverse effect upon the price of our common stock 
the stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations 
these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
holders of our common stock are subject to the risk of dilution of their investment as the result of the issuance to our lenders of warrants or convertible securities to purchase common stock 

table of contents as part of the consideration for amending our previous credit agreement in december  we issued a series of warrants the warrants  that are subject to anti dilution provisions  to our then existing lenders to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
subsequent to the original issuance date and pursuant to the anti dilution provisions  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants was increased by a total of  shares and the exercise price was adjusted to per share as the result of the issuance of restricted stock at a price less than  and stock options and warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price less than  the warrant exercise price then in effect 
as of march   following the exercise of warrants by certain holders  there were in aggregate  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the remaining warrants 
in addition  pursuant to the anti dilution provisions  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may increase if the company issues additional shares of common stock at a price less than  or additional securities with an exercise or conversion price less than  the exercise price of the warrants then in effect 
the exercise of the remaining warrants and any increase  due to the anti dilution provisions  in the number of shares into which the remaining warrants are exercisable  would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 
a majority of our common stock is held by tontine capital  which has the ability to control all matters requiring shareholder approval and whose interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
in addition  the ownership of a significant portion of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of a few holders 
as of march   tontine capital beneficially owned  shares of our common stock or approximately of our total common stock outstanding 
as a result of its majority interest  tontine capital has the ability to control all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of our directors  the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation  the approval of mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  decisions affecting our capital structure and other significant corporate transactions 
in addition to its majority interest  pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with tontine capital  dated april   if tontine capital i holds between and of our common stock then outstanding  tontine capital has the right to appoint one nominee to our board  or ii holds at least of our common stock then outstanding  tontine capital has the right to appoint two nominees to our board 
as of march   tontine capital has one director on the company s board of directors and has not exercised its right to nominate a second director to the board 
the interests of tontine capital may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
the influence of tontine capital may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers  delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management  or limiting the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
in addition  tontine capital and its affiliates are in the business of investing in companies and may  from time to time  invest in companies that compete directly or indirectly with us 
tontine capital and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and  as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
we are not able to predict whether or when tontine capital or other large stockholders will sell or otherwise dispose of substantial amounts of our common stock 
sales or other dispositions of our common stock by these stockholders could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in filings with the sec  tontine capital has indicated that it may dispose of its equity interests in the company at any time and from time to time 
this public disclosure and any future dispositions of stock by tontine capital could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in filings with the sec  tontine capital has indicated that it may dispose of its equity interests in the company at any time and from time to time in the open market  through dispositions in kind to parties holding an ownership interest in tontine capital or otherwise 
the public disclosure of such possible disposition may adversely affect the market price for our common stock due to the large number of shares involved 
in addition  we are not able to predict whether or when tontine capital will dispose of its stock 
any such future disposition of stock by tontine capital may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws may delay  defer or prevent a change in control that our shareholders each might consider to be in their best interest 

table of contents our articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider  and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
we have in place a rights agreement which permits under certain circumstances each holder of common stock  other than potential acquirers  to purchase one one hundredth of a share of a newly created series of our preferred stock at a purchase price of or to acquire additional shares of our common stock at of the current market price 
the rights are not exercisable or transferable until a person or group acquires or more of our outstanding common stock  except with respect to tontine capital and its affiliates and associates  which are exempt from the provisions of the rights agreement pursuant to an amendment signed on march  the effects of the rights agreement would be to discourage a stockholder from attempting to take over our company without negotiating with our board of directors 
conditions within the insurance markets could impact our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for various liability coverages and could potentially result in uninsured losses 
we generally negotiate our insurance contracts annually for property  casualty  workers compensation  general liability  health insurance  and directors and officers liability coverage 
due to conditions within these insurance markets and other factors beyond our control  future coverage limits  terms and conditions and the amount of the related premiums could have a negative impact on our operating results 
while we continually measure the risk reward of policy limits and coverage  the lack of coverage in certain circumstances could result in potential uninsured losses

overview of markets and related industry performance while the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future course of the global economy and fluctuating market conditions have had an impact on business conditions in our three primary markets  rv  mh and industrial markets  in prior periods  we have seen a recovery in certain markets and have executed a number of strategic initiatives which have helped mitigate the negative impact of these macro economic factors 
the rv industry  which is our primary market and which represented of the company s sales  continued to strengthen in as evidenced by higher production levels and wholesale unit shipments versus the prior year 
according to the recreational vehicle industry association rvia  shipment levels of  units in represented an increase of versus the prior year  resulting in eight out of nine quarter over quarter increases in shipments following declines in the previous fiscal quarters 
although the year marked the fourth year in the last ten years that shipment levels were below the  unit level  it represented the second consecutive year in 
table of contents which shipment levels increased after declines in the previous three years 
industry wide retail sales and the related production levels of rv s will depend to a significant extent on the course of the economy and consumer confidence 
continued high or increased fuel prices could negatively impact rv retail unit sales in the short term  however  we believe there is a positive correlation between consumer confidence and rv shipment levels and  therefore  we believe the rv industry has a positive longer term outlook as overall economic conditions and consumer confidence continue to improve 
although consumers still remain cautious when deciding whether or not to purchase discretionary items such as rvs  long term demographic trends favor rv industry growth fueled by the anticipated positive impact that aging baby boomers are estimated to have on the industry as the industry continues its recovery from the recent economic recession 
based on current market conditions  the rvia is predicting a increase in full year unit shipments compared to the mh industry  which represented approximately the company s sales in  continues to be negatively impacted by a lack of financing and credit availability  job losses  and excess foreclosed residential housing inventories 
according to industry sources  wholesale unit shipments  which continue to be well below historical levels  increased approximately from although we believe the mh industry has bottomed and should resume moderate growth given the recalibration of quality credit standards and it being a cost effective alternative for those individuals and families seeking relatively less expensive homes or whose credit ratings have been impacted by the economic and jobs environment over the past three years  or who have not yet established credit  the significant number of vacant and repossessed homes in the marketplace and less than favorable lending conditions are expected to dampen growth in the mh industry for at least the next months 
factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry include quality credit standards in the residential housing market  job growth  favorable changes in financing laws  new tax credits for new home buyers and other government incentives  and higher interest rates on traditional residential housing loans 
federal emergency management agency fema units helped to bolster shipments in the mh industry in based on the industry s current annualized run rates  the company projects mh industry unit shipments for the full year to increase by compared to the industrial market  which comprises primarily the kitchen cabinet industry  retail and commercial fixture market  household furniture market and regional distributors  is primarily impacted by macroeconomic conditions  and more specifically  conditions in the residential housing market 
the industrial market sector  which accounted for approximately of the company s sales in  saw new housing starts for increase by approximately from as reported by the us department of commerce 
we estimate approximately of our industrial revenue base is directly tied to the residential housing market  and we believe there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing construction 
our sales to this market generally lag new residential housing starts by six to twelve months 
in order to offset some of the impacts of the weakness in the residential housing market  we have focused on diversification efforts  strategic acquisitions  bringing new and innovative products to the market  and have targeted certain sales efforts towards market segments that are less directly tied to residential new home construction  including the retail fixture  furniture  and countertop markets 
as a result  we have seen a shift in our product mix which has had a positive impact on revenues from the industrial markets 
we remain cautious about further growth in the industrial sector due to restricted credit conditions and current uncertainty related to general economic conditions and the large numbers of repossessed homes in the marketplace 
in the long term  we believe residential housing growth will be based on job growth  the availability of credit  affordable interest rates  and continuing government incentives to stimulate housing demand and reduce surplus inventory due to foreclosures 
in addition  higher energy costs  the impact of the tsunami in japan  and increased demand in certain market sectors have driven up the costs of certain raw materials 
the company continues to explore alternative sources of raw materials and components  both domestically and from overseas

the above items and other execution drivers helped the company achieve its best financial performance and highest net income levels since fiscal year outlook all three of the primary markets we serve continue to be impacted by general economic conditions  extremely tight credit and lending conditions  and low jobs growth  particularly in the manufacturing sector 
although rv market conditions continued to improve in  we anticipate that the market will continue to be impacted by the residual effects of the recession and consumer confidence levels during  as consumers remain cautious when deciding whether or not to purchase discretionary items such as rvs 
in addition  the recent sharp increase in gasoline prices  political uncertainty in the middle east  and the debt crisis in europe could negatively affect rv demand 
the full restoration of rv sales to prior levels is projected to be slow and uneven 
as a result of these factors and the improved economic environment  we anticipate a increase in rv unit shipment levels in in addition  although we anticipate an increase in production levels in the mh industry in  it will continue to be well below sales levels 
new housing starts in are estimated to improve by approximately year over year 
table of contents as forecasted by the national association of home builders as of february  consistent with slowly improving overall economic conditions

summary of liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations  which primarily includes selling our products and collecting receivables  available cash reserves and borrowing capacity available under the credit facility 
our primary uses of cash are to meet working capital demands  which primarily include paying our creditors and employees  meet debt service requirements  fund acquisitions and support our capital expenditure plans 
we also have a substantial asset collateral base  which we believe  if sold in the normal course  is sufficient to cover our outstanding senior debt 
we are subject to market risk primarily in relation to our cash and short term investments 
the interest rate we may earn on the cash we invest in short term investments is subject to market fluctuations 
while we attempt to minimize market risk and maximize return  changes in market conditions may significantly affect the income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  all of our debt obligations under our credit facility are currently subject to variable rates of interest 
cash  cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facility are expected to be sufficient to finance the known and or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs of the company for at least the next months  exclusive of any acquisitions  based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs 
borrowings under our revolver are subject to a borrowing base  up to a maximum borrowing limit of million 
the borrowing base as defined in the credit agreement  as of any date of determination  is the sum of current asset availability plus fixed asset availability less the aggregate amount of reserves  if any 
the actual borrowing base available as of december  was million 
our ability to access unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility as a source of liquidity is dependent on our maintaining compliance with the financial covenants as specified under the terms of the credit agreement 
in  we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at each reporting date as required under the terms of the credit agreement 
based on our operating plan  we expect to continue to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement  notwithstanding continued uncertain and volatile market conditions 
if we fail to comply with the covenants under the credit agreement  there can be no assurance that the lenders that are party to our credit agreement will consent to an amendment of the credit agreement 
in this event  the lenders and or the holders of the march notes and the september notes could cause the related indebtedness to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in the company having to refinance its indebtedness under unfavorable terms 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full should they be required to be sold outside of the normal course of business  such as through forced liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings 
management has also identified other actions within its control that could be implemented  if necessary  to provide liquidity and help the company reduce its leverage position 
these actions include the exploration of asset sales  divestitures and other types of capital raising alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that these actions will 
table of contents be successful or generate cash resources adequate to retire or sufficiently reduce the company s indebtedness under the credit agreement 
in  our management team is focused on increasing our market share  maintaining margins  the implementation of our new erp system  keeping costs aligned with revenue  further improving operating efficiencies  aggressively managing inventory levels and pricing  and acquiring businesses product lines that meet established criteria  all of which may impact our sources and uses of cash from period to period and impact our liquidity levels 
in addition  future liquidity and capital resources may be impacted as we continue to make targeted capital investments to support new business and leverage our operating platform 
in particular  in the fourth quarter of  the company commenced a project to replace and upgrade its erp system over the next to months that will require upgrades to and or the replacement of existing hardware and software in addition to costs incurred from the services provided by third party consultants 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes related to the rv and mh industries  the timing of deliveries  and the payment cycles of our customers 
in the event that our operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would seek to revise our operating strategies accordingly 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance  current economic and capital market conditions  and other relevant circumstances

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments trade receivables 
we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries and other industrial markets 
trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we control credit risk related to our trade receivables through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures  and perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
in assessing the carrying value of its trade receivables  the company estimates the recoverability by making assumptions based on factors such as current overall and industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical write off and collection experience  the level of past due amounts  and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future if a customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than the company s historical experience 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company does not accrue interest on any of its trade receivables 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased by million to million at december  compared to million for in  the allowance for doubtful accounts was decreased by million to million compared to million for inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out fifo method or market 
based on the inventory aging and other considerations for realizable value  the company writes down the carrying value to market value where appropriate 
the company reviews inventory on hand and records provisions for obsolete inventory 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and operating results 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for inventory obsolescence of million and million was established at december  and  respectively 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
the company decreased its reserve for obsolescence by million at december  to million from million at december  and decreased the reserve by million at december  from million at december  reflecting a continued focus on managing inventory to levels more consistent with demand in order to maximize liquidity 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the rv or mh industries  and or a loss of a major customer or several customers 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and forecasts 
the net carrying 
table of contents value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
the recoverability of pp e is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  primarily based on estimated selling price  appraised value or projected future cash flows 
no events or changes in circumstances occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment for the years ended december   and  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges for those years 
all of the company s goodwill and long lived asset impairment assessments are based on established fair value techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis 
these analyses require management to estimate both future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the current business model 
the assumptions supporting valuation models  including discount rates  are determined using the best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty  and differences in actual future results may require further impairment charges  which may be significant 
impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets acquired are classified as either trademarks  customer relationships or non compete agreements 
the company s goodwill and its other intangible assets balances at december  were million and million  respectively 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets such as trademarks are not amortized but are subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test in the fourth quarter based on their estimated fair value 
we test more frequently  if there are indicators of impairment  or whenever such circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable 
these indicators include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
a significant adverse change in the business climate could result in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve previously projected revenue growth 
no such events occurred during  or that indicate the existence of impairment with respect to our reported goodwill  trademarks or other intangible assets 
we perform impairment reviews of goodwill at the reporting unit level  one level below the business segment 
a reporting unit constitutes a business for which discrete profit and loss financial information is available 
the company s reportable segments  manufacturing and distribution  are those based on the company s method of internal reporting which segregates its businesses by product category and production distribution process 
goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to the company s reporting units at the date they are initially recorded 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level  one level below the business segment 
once goodwill has been allocated to a reporting unit  it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition  but instead becomes identified with the reporting unit as a whole 
the company s manufacturing segment includes goodwill originating from the acquisitions of gravure ink acquired in the adorn acquisition  quality hardwoods  aia and performance graphics 
while gravure  aia and performance graphics remain reporting units of the company for which impairment is assessed  quality hardwoods is assessed for impairment as part of the company s hardwood door reporting unit 
the company s distribution segment includes goodwill originating from the acquisition of blazon  which remains a reporting unit for which impairment is assessed 
finite lived intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on estimated undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist 
newly acquired indefinite lived assets are more vulnerable to impairments as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period 
as such  immediately after acquisition  even a small decline in the outlook for these products can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment loss 
we based our determination of the fair value of each of our reporting units using the income approach or a discounted cash flow dcf model 
preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf 
table of contents model involve significant judgments and assumptions  and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
we start with a forecast of expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit  and discount the cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation 
other estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to  terminal growth rate  the weighted average cost of capital  five year compound average growth rate  and forecasts of revenue  operating income  ebitda  and capital expenditures 
analyses for and indicated our assumptions and estimates were reasonable 
however  a future decline in the overall market value of the company s equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value 
we also consider the relationship of debt to equity of other similar companies  as well as the risks and uncertainty inherent in the markets in which we generally operate and in the company s internally developed forecasts 
while we do consider our market capitalization in assessing goodwill impairment  it is not weighted heavily  as the company s market value of its common stock is materially impacted by the significant ownership of a single majority shareholder  tontine capital partners  lp and affiliates 
however  as part of our annual assessment for goodwill impairment  we do compare the company s stock price on the nasdaq global market stock exchange to the company s book value per share as a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization could indicate a potential impairment of goodwill in one or more of our reporting units 
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment changes to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit s fair value exceeded the carrying amount step of the goodwill impairment test 
based on the results of step of our annual impairment analysis of goodwill for  we determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for each of our reporting units within the manufacturing segment and for the reporting unit within the distribution segment 
the goodwill allocated to the manufacturing and distribution segment reporting units as of december  was million and million  respectively 
in addition  there are no long lived assets or asset groups  including tangible assets  for which we have determined that undiscounted cash flows are not substantially in excess of the carrying value or that could materially impact our operating results or total shareholders equity 
we have not made any material changes to our methods of evaluating goodwill and intangible asset impairments during the last three years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine impairment in the foreseeable future 
deferred income taxes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if these assumptions change  the company may be required to record valuation allowances against its gross deferred tax assets  which would cause the company to record additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates the potential the company will be able to realize its gross deferred tax assets and assesses the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
at december   the company had a tax valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance was subsequently reduced by million in and by million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details

inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of lauan  gypsum  and particleboard  and components made by the company which are made from these raw materials  are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these 
table of contents commodities  such as the price of oil  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile  and after rising significantly during the first half of  have recently moderated 
during periods of rising commodity prices  we have generally been able to pass the increased costs to our customers in the form of surcharges and price increases 
we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on results of operations for the periods presented
