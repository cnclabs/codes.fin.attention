overview we are an owner  developer and operator of strategically located data centers in some of the largest and fastest growing data center markets in the united states  including los angeles  the san francisco bay and northern virginia areas  chicago  boston  new york city and miami 
our high quality data centers feature ample and redundant power  advanced cooling and security systems and many are points of dense network interconnection 
we are able to satisfy the full spectrum of our customers data center requirements by providing data center space ranging in size from an entire building or large dedicated suites to a cage or cabinet 
we lease our space to a broad and growing customer base ranging from enterprise customers to less space intensive  more network centric customers 
our operational flexibility allows us to selectively lease data center space to its highest and best use depending on customer demand  regional economies and property characteristics 
as of december   our property portfolio included operating data center facilities and one development site  which collectively comprise over million nrsf  of which approximately million nrsf is existing data center space 
these properties include  nrsf of space readily available for lease  of which  nrsf is available for lease as data center space 
including the space currently under construction or in preconstruction at december   and including currently operating space targeted for future redevelopment  we own land and buildings sufficient to develop or redevelop  square feet of data center space  comprised of  nrsf of data center space currently under construction   nrsf of office and industrial space currently available for redevelopment  and  nrsf of new data center space that can be developed on land that we currently own at our coronado stender business park 
we expect that this redevelopment and development potential plus any potential expansion into new markets will enable us to accommodate existing and future customer demand and position us to significantly increase our cash flows 
we intend to pursue redevelopment and development projects and expansion into new markets when we believe those opportunities support the additional supply in those markets 
results of operations prior to the closing of our ipo on september   we had no corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of our company 
the results of operations for the year ended december   reflect the financial condition and operating results of our predecessor  which was comprised of the real estate activities and holdings of a carlyle real estate fund that contributed properties into our portfolio in connection with the ipo 
the results of operations for the year ended december   reflect the financial condition and results of operations of our predecessor  together with the coresite acquired properties  from september   the date of acquisition 
the contribution or acquisition of interests in the coresite acquired properties was accounted for as an acquisition by our predecessor under the acquisition method of accounting and recognized at the estimated fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities on the date of the contribution 
our results of operations may therefore not be indicative of our future results of operations 
our predecessor was comprised of the real estate activities and interconnection services of four of our operating properties  mccarthy  avenue of the americas  sunrise valley and innerbelt  as well as the coronado stender business park 
the coresite acquired properties include our continuing real estate operations at s 
market  one wilshire  k street  n 
alameda  s 
lasalle and nw nd street  as well as th street  a property we lease for our corporate headquarters  which does not generate operating revenue

net loss for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of the coresite acquired properties and increased general and administrative expense resulting from increased legal and other fees incurred in connection with our ipo 
the increased property operating and maintenance costs  depreciation and amortization expense and rent expense were offset by increased operating revenue from the placement into service and subsequent leasing of coronado during the second quarter of and the acquisition of the coresite acquired properties 
factors that may influence our results of operations rental income 
our ability to increase the net rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability i to maintain the historical occupancy rates of currently leased space and ii to lease currently available space and space that becomes available from leases that expire or are terminated at or in excess of current rental rates 
as of december   our operating data center facilities comprised approximately of our total nrsf 
our ability to grow the rental income generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods 
future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our markets or downturns in the technology industry that impair our ability to renew or re lease space and the ability of our customers to fulfill their lease commitments  as in the case of customer bankruptcies  could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
as of december   we had  leases with over customers 
as of december   approximately of our leases contained annual base rent escalations that were either fixed generally ranging from to or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index 
for more information  see the table under part i  item lease expirations which includes annualized rent in effect as of december   and annualized rent in effect at expiration for leases in our portfolio grouped by year of lease expiration 
leasing arrangements 
historically  many of our properties have been leased to customers on a full service gross or a modified gross basis  both net of electricity expense  and to a limited extent on a triple net lease basis 
we expect to continue to do so in the future 
under a full service gross lease  the customer pays a fixed annual rent on a monthly basis  and in return we are required to pay all maintenance  repair  property taxes  insurance  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
under a modified gross lease  the customer has a base year expense stop  whereby the customer pays a stated amount of certain expenses as part of the rent payment  while future increases above the base year stop in property operating expenses are billed to the customer based on such customer s proportionate square footage of the property and other factors 
the increased property operating expenses billed are reflected as customer reimbursements in the statements of operations 
finally  in a triple net lease  the customer is responsible for all operating expenses  property taxes and insurance 
as such  the base rent payment does not include any operating expense  but rather all such expenses are billed to the customer 
the full amount of the expenses for this lease type is reflected in customer reimbursements 
since a portion of our revenue consists of those expenses reimbursed to us by our customers  in any given period our revenue will be determined in part by the amount of expenses that are reimbursed by our customers 
the following table sets forth the nrsf of our portfolio leased under full service gross  modified gross and triple net leases as well as the annualized rent attributable to such leases as of december  september  september  september  september  full service gross modified gross triple net total leased nrsf of total annualized rent of total 
table of contents substantially all of our data center nrsf are subject to the breakered amp or sub metered branch circuit monitoring pricing models 
the allocation between the two models across our data center customer base does not materially affect our ability to recover our electricity costs because we separately recover all or substantially all of our electricity costs for all of our leased data center space under either model 
under the sub metered model  a customer pays us monthly for the power attributable to its equipment in the data center as well as for its ratable allocation of the power used to provide the cooling  lighting  security and other requirements supporting the data center  in each case  at a rate substantially equivalent to our then current cost of electricity 
under the breakered amp model  a customer pays a fixed monthly fee per committed available ampere of connected power 
the extent to which this fixed monthly fee correlates to the monthly amount we pay to our utility provider for electricity at each data center facility varies depending upon the amount of power each customer utilizes each month relative to the amount of committed power purchased 
under the breakered amp model  a customer s base rent per nrsf is generally lower than in the branch circuit monitoring model  reflecting the differing approach to electricity cost recovery between the two models 
fluctuations in our customers monthly utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us for power impact our operating revenue  expense and earnings differently depending upon the applicable power pricing model 
under breakered amp leases  such fluctuations do not impact our operating revenue but do impact our operating expense and  as such  our earnings because our breakered amp customers pay for an amount of committed power regardless of the amount of power they use and we recognize the difference between monthly revenue from breakered amp power commitments and our monthly electricity costs as income 
accordingly  in any given period our breakered amp revenue is fixed whereas our related expense which is dependent on utilization can fluctuate 
for leases under our sub metered model  fluctuations in our customers monthly utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us for power impact our operating revenue and operating expense in a similar manner so those fluctuations do not have a material impact on our earnings 
additionally  under each model  during the initial lease up period of new space or buildings  we generally do not fully recover our electricity costs attributable to the power used to provide the cooling  lighting  security and other requirements supporting the data center 
scheduled lease expirations 
our ability to re lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates materially affects our results of operations 
as of december   approximately  nrsf of our portfolio represented currently available space 
leases representing approximately and of the nrsf across our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending december  and  respectively  of which  nrsf relates to one lease at our mccarthy property which is scheduled to expire in april the leases scheduled to expire in and also represent approximately and  respectively  of our annualized rent as of december  we continue to see strong demand in our markets for data center space and expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on any new re leased or renewed leases for and expirations will generally be higher than the rates currently being paid for the same space 
for the year ended december   rents on re leased renewed space increased by an average of on a gaap basis compared to the expiring rents for the same space 
our past performance may not be indicative of future results  and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates 
further  re leased renewed rental rates in a particular market may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole due to a number of factors  including local real estate conditions  local supply and demand for data center space  the condition of the property and whether the property  or space within the property  has been redeveloped 
acquisitions  redevelopment and development and financing 
our ability to grow rental income depends on our ability to acquire  redevelop  develop and lease data center space at favorable rental rates 
as of december   we had approximately  nrsf of vacant redevelopment space or approximately of the total space in our portfolio 
our portfolio also contains five office and light industrial buildings on a acre development site in santa clara  california  which can be developed into an additional  nrsf of data center space 
we generally fund the cost of data center redevelopment and development from additional capital  which  for future redevelopment and developments  we would expect to obtain through unsecured and secured borrowings  construction financings and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities  when market conditions permit 
if we cannot obtain capital when needed or on favorable terms  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities arise 
conditions in significant markets 
our operating properties are located in los angeles  the san francisco bay and northern virginia areas  chicago  boston  new york city and miami 
these markets comprised      and  respectively  of our annualized rent as of december  positive or negative changes in conditions in these markets will impact our overall performance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources discussion of cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior period 
the increased cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to the increased number of operating properties acquired in connection with our ipo 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures related to redevelopment and development of data center space 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in financing activities of million was primarily due to the payment of dividends  the net proceeds received in connection with our ipo and a decrease in capital contributions received from the member of our predecessor 
these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in the repayments of mortgage loans payable and redemption of operating partnership units 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior period 
the increased cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to the increased number of operating properties acquired in connection with our ipo 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures related to redevelopment and development of data center space partially offset by cash balances acquired in connection with our predecessor s acquisition of the coresite acquired properties 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the net proceeds received in connection with our ipo  an increase in capital contributions received from the member of our predecessor  partially offset by the redemption of operating partnership units and the repayment of mortgages payable 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and equivalents  excluding million of restricted cash 
restricted cash primarily consists of interest bearing cash deposits required by the terms of our loans and cash impound accounts for real estate taxes  insurance and anticipated or contractually obligated tenant improvements as required by several of our mortgage loans 
our short term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds needed for future distributions to stockholders and holders of our operating partnership units  interest expense  operating costs including utilities  site maintenance costs  real estate and personal property taxes  insurance  rental expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses and certain recurring and non recurring capital expenditures  including for the redevelopment and development of data center space during the next months 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations  reserves established for certain future payments  and by incurring additional indebtedness  including by drawing on our revolving credit facility 
our long term liquidity requirements primarily consist of the costs to fund the development of the coronado stender properties  our acre development site that houses five buildings in santa clara  california  future redevelopment or development of other space in our portfolio not currently scheduled  property acquisitions  future distributions to stockholders and holders of our operating partnership units  scheduled debt maturities and recurring and non recurring capital improvements 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements primarily by incurring long term indebtedness and drawing on our revolving credit facility 
we also may raise capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  subject to prevailing market conditions  and or through the issuance of operating partnership units

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof 
acquisition of real estate 
we apply purchase accounting to the assets and liabilities related to all of our real estate investments acquired 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to the acquired tangible assets  consisting primarily of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and lease origination costs 
these allocation assessments involve significant judgment and complex calculations and have a direct impact on our results of operations 
capitalization of costs 
we capitalize direct and indirect costs related to leasing  construction  redevelopment and development  including property taxes  insurance and financing costs relating to properties under development 
we cease cost capitalization on redevelopment and development space once the space is ready for its intended use and held available for occupancy 
all renovations and betterments that extend the economic useful lives of assets are capitalized 
useful lives of assets 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over to years 
additionally we depreciate building improvements over ten years for owned properties and the remaining term of the original lease for leased properties 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the carrying value of our properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies to a considerable extent on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
if  in future periods  there are changes in the estimates or assumptions incorporated into an impairment review analysis  these changes could result in an adjustment to the carrying amount of our assets 
to the extent that an impairment has occurred  the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value would be charged to income 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
goodwill 
the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
our company s goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

table of contents revenue recognition 
rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancellable term of customer leases 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are recorded as deferred rent receivable on our balance sheets 
many of our leases contain provisions under which our customers reimburse us for a portion of direct operating expenses  including power  as well as real estate taxes and insurance 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are recognized 
we recognize the amortization of the acquired above market and below market leases as decreases and increases  respectively  to rental revenue over the remaining non cancellable term of the underlying leases 
if the value of below market leases includes renewal option periods  we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized 
interconnection and utility services are considered separate earnings processes that are typically provided and completed on a month to month basis and revenue is recognized in the period that the services are performed 
set up charges and utility installation fees are initially deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance unless management determines a separate earnings process exists related to an installation charge 
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements and other income 
we analyze individual accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
share based awards 
we generally recognize compensation expense related to share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the calculation of the fair value of share based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility  dividend payments and interest rates 
these assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted the provisions of this standard effective september  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on out consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  we must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk 
many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of consolidated indebtedness that bore interest at variable rates  of which million and million of our consolidated indebtedness are hedged against libor interest rate increases above and  respectively 
in addition  we entered into a swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate on million of our consolidated indebtedness under our s 
market mortgage at through the maturity date of such indebtedness 
we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis 
our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical change in year end interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase by  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt excluding the million of consolidated indebtedness under our s 
market mortgage that is hedged through our interest rate swap would decrease future earnings and cash flows by less than million annually 
if interest rates were to decrease  the decrease in interest expense excluding the million of consolidated indebtedness under our s 
market mortgage that is hedged through our interest rate swap on the variable rate debt would be less than million annually 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could impact interest rates 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to interest rates 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure
